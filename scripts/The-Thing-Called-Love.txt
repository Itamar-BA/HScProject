MIRANDA=>You know what would be great? If you could just stand there, watching me carry all these boxes out by myself. Don�t carry out any yourself, don�t hold the door for me, and whatever you do, don�t put them in your cab. And if you could possible start the meter running now. . .
MIRANDA=>Perfect. Good job. Thank you.
ELLEN=>. . . I just never imagined there would be this much, Miranda.
MIRANDA=>You should see how much I threw out.
MIRANDA=>You can ship them to me as soon as I get an apartment.
ELLEN=>Maybe I should keep them in storage until you come back.
MIRANDA=>I�m not coming back.
MIRANDA=>Mom, I told you, I�m moving.
ELLEN=>Saying you�re going to do something and actually doing it are two entirely different things. I hate to see you give up everything to go and pursue this . . . fantasy you have about being a . . . country singer. Have you taken a moment to stop and look at your behavior?
MIRANDA=>I�ll do it on the bus, O.K.?
ELLEN=>I know you father made Nashville sound very romantic. I wish he were here now to see you acting this way. He could tell you how difficult it is.
MIRANDA=>That�s not what he�d tell me.
ELLEN=>Yes, he probably would, but in the real world, the chances of making it are a million to one.
MIRANDA=>How can I pass up a one in a million opportunity?
MIRANDA=>I don�t expect you to understand why I have to do this. I just want you to send me my stuff.
ELLEN=>I really think you should think about this for a few days.
MIRANDA=>I�ve been thinking about it my whole life. It�s time for me to do it.
MIRANDA=>I have to go. My cab is waiting.
MIRANDA=>My mother thinks she can control my life.
DRIVER=>She stills sees you as a little girl.
DRIVER=>Where to?
MIRANDA=>Do you know where this is? Lucy�s Caf�?
DRIVER=>They�d have to take away my license if I didn�t.
FEMALE VOICE=>O.K. Listen up. Gentlemen, ladies.
LUCY=>As you go in, make sure you take an application. No one tries out without filling one of these out. Hurry it up, doors close at 3:05. Anyone not inside by 3:05 gets locked out.
DRIVER=>You a songwriter?
MIRANDA=>No.
DRIVER=>Lucky for you. Town�s full of them. I�m a songwriter myself.
MIRANDA=>I�m a singer.
LUCY=>Thank you all for coming today. When I call your name, come right up on stage. Pretend like you�re in a hurry, we got all day but there�s a lot of people want to be famous here. If it�s your first time here, you should know: if you don�t pass, it just means I don�t think you�re ready. Go home and keep at it and come back again. Don�t give up unless you can�t stand to listen to your own material. All right, let�s get to it.
LUCY=>Cash Wilneck, get on up here.
MIRANDA=>Where�s the safety glass?
MIRANDA=>I could shoot you if I wanted.
DRIVER=>Appreciate it if you didn�t.
MIRANDA=>It�s locked?
JAMES=>Was your bus late?
MIRANDA=>As a matter of fact . . .
JAMES=>Well, it�s a long way from . . . New York City.
MIRANDA=>Yes it is. Who are you? The psychic welcoming committee?
JAMES=>James Wynn. The door is locked.
MIRANDA=>Miranda Presley. I�ll just knock.
JAMES=>No, don�t. Lucy doesn�t let anyone in late. That�ll set me back a month. We�ll have to get in some other way.
MIRANDA=>I�m sure there�s a secret underground tunnel.
JAMES=>There�ll be a lot of people coming out in about two hours.
MIRANDA=>Did I mention that I can vaporize myself like �I Dream of Jeannie�?
JAMES=>A lot of good that does me.
JAMES=>I have an idea. Let�s knock.
MIRANDA=>It�s true. Everyone is slower down here.
LUCY=>Nick Reynolds.
NICK=>Hi, I�m Nick Reynolds. I�m from Memphis, originally. This one�s called �Shoot me up, run me down, take me back,� and it�s dedicated to you, Lucy.
LUCY=>Next. Linda Lue Linden.
LUCY=>Goodness, honey, is that your name?
LINDA LUE=>I�m afraid so.
KYLE=>I�m, um, Kyle Davidson. I�m from Texas. I�m a little nervous, but it doesn�t really show.
KYLE=>This song is called �Blue and Blue.�
LUCY=>James Wynn
JAMES=>Howdy. James Wynn, from Austin, Texas. I call this one �Friends no more.�
LUCY=>Miranda Presley, looks like you get to be the fat lady.
MIRANDA=>Hi, I�m Miranda Presley from New York City.
LUCY=>Excuse me. Excuse me. Miranda? Honey, do you have another song?
MIRANDA=>Sure. I know lots of songs. What do you want to hear?
LUCY=>Try something I haven�t heard before. A Miranda Presley composition, maybe. This ain�t �Star Search�.
MIRANDA=>Oh. Well, I don�t have anything right now.
LUCY=>Well, come on back when you do, O.K.?
MIRANDA=>Sure thing.
LUCY=>Now. I�m going to read off the names of the people who passed for next month�s performances. If I read your name, come see me to sign up for which night you want to play. Nancy Butterworth, Nick Reynolds, Tom Mortenson, Ricky Hogan, James Wynn. . . .
JAMES=>You want a lift somewhere?
MIRANDA=>Why, I would be much obliges if you would convey me in this Glen Campbell Hee-Haw pick-up truck.
JAMES=>Just so you know, I�m not taking this personally, these little jabs and put- downs about what a yee-haw hillbilly town you have landed your cosmopolitan self in. Where are you staying?
MIRANDA=>I haven�t decided.
MIRANDA=>Linda Lue Linden.
MIRANDA=>Thanks for sneaking us in.
LINDA LUE=>Oh, you�re welcome. I don�t normally flaunt the rules, but my little voice told me I should open that door. And I do believe it was right.
JAMES=>Thanks.
KYLE=>James, right? Kyle Davidson.
KYLE=>No.
MIRANDA=>Too bad. I liked your song.
KYLE=>Yeah, I liked yours too. Always have.
KYLE=>That�s it exactly. How did you know that?
MIRANDA=>All I did was sing it on key.
KYLE=>Are you going to Red�s? A bunch of us are going to Red�s. For a beer.
LINDA LUE=>That sounds like fun.
JAMES=>I am.
LINDA LUE=>Well, it�s four if you count Eddie. He was my mother�s second cousin on her mother�s side. He was found at the bottom of my inflatable play pool. I found him, actually.
LINDA LUE=>I noticed you have your suitcase. Do you have a place to stay?
LINDA LUE=>I have a real cute motel room, with two beds. There�s even a pool, shaped like a guitar. We could share it.
MIRANDA=>You�ve known me fifteen minutes and you want me to move in? I could be a serial killer, for all you know.
LINDA LUE=>Oh, I can see that you�re not. I�m an excellent judge of character. I�ve got a touch of the power.
KYLE=>My grandmother can tell when a tornado is coming, a week in advance.
LINDA LUE=>Some things are beyond our comprehension.
LINDA LUE=>Now you, you got a real strong heart line, see it here.
KYLE=>Is that good?
LINDA LUE=>Well, sure, but it can also be a little dangerous. My cousin Lester, he had a similar heart line, and he threw himself in front of a speeding train in the name
MIRANDA=>My cousin Leon did the very same thing.
LINDA LUE=>Isn�t that a coincidence. You want me to do yours?
MIRANDA=>If I�m going to meet with a bizarre premature death, I�d just as soon not know about it
LINDA LUE=>All right.
LINDA LUE=>I�m not saying it�ll be soon. Don�t you want me to read your heart line?
MIRANDA=>No. Thanks.
JAMES=>Hey, let me see your heart line.
JAMES=>You will remain unmarried until the age of 60 . . . at which time you will wed a series
MIRANDA=>Namely?
JAMES=>They will all be named Bubba. Sometimes it will be a nickname, or a middle name.
LINDA LUE=>You can have either bed. I�ve been using this one . . .
LINDA LUE=>. . . but you can take whichever you want.
MIRANDA=>Is this the extra, the Loretta Lynn suite?
LINDA LUE=>Uh-huh.
LINDA LUE=>Well, I was waiting for you take a breath, Mama, so I could get a word in. . . Yeah, just like Loretta. . .
LINDA LUE=>Only prettier.
LINDA LUE=>Are you going somewhere?
MIRANDA=>I�m just going to go to that coffee shop across the street.
LINDA LUE=>But it�s late. Don�t you want to go to bed?
MIRANDA=>I�m not tired. I�ll be quiet when I come in.
LINDA LUE=>Well, all right. I�ll be seeing you.
MIRANDA=>Goodnight, Scarlett.
LINDA LUE=>Did I remember to give the spare room key?
MIRANDA=>Annette, I�ve got a hot tip that Frankie and his friends are going to crash your slumber party. You don�t want to miss that.
LINDA LUE=>Do you hate me?
MIRANDA=>How could anyone possibly hate you? You�re Miss Congeniality.
LINDA LUE=>I was hoping we could be great friends.
MIRANDA=>I don�t know if that�s such a fabulous idea.
LINDA LUE=>Why not?
MIRANDA=>Look, I came here to be alone. Nothing personal.
MIRANDA=>Nothing personal. I swear. Cross my heart.
LINDA LUE=>Some people aren�t exactly the people you they are when you first meet someone.
WAITRESS=>More coffee, honey?
MIRANDA=>No, thanks.
MIRANDA=>Who�s here at this ungodly hour?
KYLE=>Hi. You look good.
MIRANDA=>Thanks.
KYLE=>What are you, getting ready to go out?
KYLE=>I just saw Linda Lue. She said you�d be asleep.
MIRANDA=>Thanks. Let me know if she says anything else.
KYLE=>Wait. I wanted to ask you something.
KYLE=>Is that your dog?
KYLE=>That�s not my question. Will you help me with my singing?
MIRANDA=>Is that your question?
KYLE=>That�s it.
MIRANDA=>O.K.
MIRANDA=>Yeah.
KYLE=>Now?
KYLE=>Great. I�ll even make you dinner.
MIRANDA=>Give me a minute.
MIRANDA=>All right. Now start the song again, but instead of singing, tell me about your guitar.
KYLE=>What do you want to know about it?
MIRANDA=>I don�t know, some kind of amusing anecdote about how your daddy traded a pig for it, or the ghost of Hank Williams Sr. Left it on your front porch.
KYLE=>My mom gave me this guitar. She said she could tell I had a lot of creative energy.
MIRANDA=>What about your dad?
MIRANDA=>Anything. Keep playing.
KYLE=>The first time I came to Nashville, I was here four months before I ran out of money and had to turn around and come back home. I thought he�d want me to give it up, since I hadn�t made it. But he just put me back to work on the ranch. Said he could use me until I was ready to give it another go.
MIRANDA=>Letting life teach you its own lessons, realizing your dreams weren�t the same as his dreams.
KYLE=>Stop me if you�ve heard my life story before.
MIRANDA=>I saw that episode of Gunsmoke. Anyway, the important thing is you�re playing the guitar without looking at your fingers.
KYLE=>Of course I don�t have to watch my fingers. It�s part of my style.
MIRANDA=>Well, don�t do it anymore. Now, look at me and sing some of the words.
KYLE=>I can�t do it.
MIRANDA=>Why not?
KYLE=>It�s personal. It�s part of me. You and me, here alone, my singing to you is practically like stripping down naked.
KYLE=>Isn�t it like that for you, singing one of your songs?
MIRANDA=>It seems to me that this is a rather serious handicap for an aspiring performer.
KYLE=>I don�t want to be a performer. I�d have to be insane to think I could ever make a dime with this voice.
MIRANDA=>I thought you wanted to learn to sing.
KYLE=>I do. So I can sing on writer�s night. I can�t get my songs recorded if nobody hears them.
MIRANDA=>Is that the only way to get them heard?
KYLE=>I�ve done about a hundred demos, me songs with other singers. Vince Gill put a song of mine on hold last summer, was thinking about putting it on his new album, but he didn�t end up cutting it.
MIRANDA=>Well, maybe if you see yourself as an actor, like it�s not really you. Play the
KYLE=>That�s nice. You write that?
KYLE=>You�re not proving your point until you play me one of your songs.
MIRANDA=>One of what?
KYLE=>You haven�t written any songs?
MIRANDA=>You�re a songwriter. I�m a singer.
KYLE=>You just haven�t written any songs yet. Nobody moves from New York to Nashville to be a singer.
MIRANDA=>Nobody but me.
KYLE=>Country music�s all about the words, having something to say. You wouldn�t be here if you didn�t have those words inside you. You just haven�t let them out yet.
MIRANDA=>I�m the one who dropped my entire life and moved someplace I�ve never even visited before. I should get to figure out why the hell I did it.
MIRANDA=>Hey, Buster.
LINDA LUE=>His name ain�t Buster.
MIRANDA=>What is it?
LINDA LUE=>Mr. Dog.
MIRANDA=>How do you know his first name isn�t Buster?
LINDA LUE=>Well, he would have told me. We discuss practically everything.
MIRANDA=>Did you unpack my stuff?
LINDA LUE=>I put your t-shirts in the second drawer, your underthings are in the top drawer, and pretty much everything else is in the closet, light to dark.
LINDA LUE=>Left to right. There was a lot of black. I guess you know that. I can�t wear black, it just washes me out. You ain�t mad, are you?
MIRANDA=>Where are my tapes?
MIRANDA=>I was thinking about what you said in the coffee shop.
LINDA LUE=>I�m trying to be more forthcoming.
MIRANDA=>Well, then let me ask you something.
MIRANDA=>Don�t most motel rooms have one Bible?
LINDA LUE=>I made these myself. I work at the Praise The Lord print company.
MIRANDA=>You didn�t steal these. . .
LINDA LUE=>Oh, lord no. These are all misprints. This one has Chapter Four from Yogi Berra�s autobiography right in the middle of Revelations. Jesus comes back and says
MIRANDA=>You�re making this up.
LINDA LUE=>Did you think it was funny?
LINDA LUE=>These really are misprints, they�re just mostly upside down, though. But here�s a booklet that�s supposed to be on how to accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior, and see, it�s all recipes for fun desserts you can make with Cool Whip. I didn�t make that up, swear to God.
MIRANDA=>I�m going to have to remember not to swear to anything in this room.
RECEPTIONIST=>I�m sorry, he doesn�t see anyone without an appointment.
MIRANDA=>O.K. Let�s make a appointment, then. Wednesday is good for me.
RECEPTIONIST=>You realize I go through this eleven times a day. I don�t let anyone slip through.
MIRANDA=>Ever? Not even like a really cute guy?
RECEPTIONIST=>That�s how I met my husband. I�m afraid I�m going to have to tell you what I tell
MIRDANDA=>So he told me to come back after they closed and �try out�, in quotes and italics, because he�s be alone and his wife is like in Tulsa and I was like, �Yeah! Absolutely! I�ll be back. Is there any possibility you could gain some more weight by tonight, because I would fine that really sexy.�
KYLE=>You didn�t say that.
MIRANDA=>I did, actually.
MIRANDA=>Don�t we have a waitress?
JAMES=>I don�t get nervous. Thanks for trying to calm me down, though.
MIRDANDA=>I�m going to the bar. Anyone want anything?
KYLE=>Beer.
JAMES=>Nothing till after I go on.
MIRANDA=>I�m not ordering a Shirley Temple.
LINDA LUE=>Nothing for me, thanks.
MIRANDA=>Two beers and a Shirley Temple.
MIRANDA=>Hey, I know you, from the audition.
NICK=>Nick Reynolds
MIRANDA=>Miranda Presley.
NICK=>That�s right. Miranda Presley. Wrote �Desperado� when you were eight years old.
MIRANDA=>I�m famous already, and I can�t even find a job.
NICK=>Lucy just lost a waitress. Maybe she�ll give you a job.
MIRANDA=>No. I�m hot a waitress, I�m a singer.
NICK=>I�m not sure I see the difference.
LUCY=>Well, if it isn�t Miss Presley. What can I do for you, honey?
NICK=>She�s interested in the waitress position. I told her you�d probably want to hire her.
MIRANDA=>Look, I don�t want to be a waitress.
LUCY=>Then why am I out here?
NICK=>I don�t know, but you sure do look nice tonight, Lucy. You want to go out later?
LUCY=>Nick, I�ve got a million things to do. Darcy called me at four in the afternoon to tell me she was quitting.
LUCY=>Oh, she�s going on tour with Rodney Crowell or some fool thing.
NICK=>What�s she going to do? Drive the bus?
MIRANDA=>Lucy.
LUCY=>No apology necessary. Just don�t pull that again. You�re welcome to try out anytime with something of your own.
NICK=>If you think opportunity keeps dropping by until you like what he�s wearing, you might as well pass this up.
MIRANDA=>Ever since I crossed the border into Tennessee, It�s been an exercise in logic to get a yes or no answer.
NICK=>Personally, I think you should take the job. You got the voice to make it someday.
MIRANDA=>How long did Darcy work here?
NICK=>You don�t want to know.
JAMES=>Hi. I�m James Wynn. I�m from Austin, where we like our music with a few rough edges. I hope that�s all right with y�all. If you like this one, maybe you can tell Lucy, let her know Nashville�s ready for something new for a change.
KYLE=>I heard he wanted Lucky to let him play without an audition. He had all these reviews from when he played in Austin. I also heard that he shot a record executive in Austin, but I don�t think that part�s true.
JAMES=>Miranda. Come here.
MIRANDA=>You were good.
JAMES=>Did you ever have a nickname?
MIRANDA=>Is that why you called me over?
MIRANDA=>No. Did you?
JAMES=>You want to go out? Right now?
MIRANDA=>Only if you do.
LINDA LUE=>I guess she found a ride.
JAMES=>One half. O.K.? I promise not to run down any of your relatives.
LINDA LUE=>Have a nice time.
JAMES=>I can�t believe you�ve never driven
MIRANDA=>I�m doing that well?
JAMES=>No. I put that wrong. I believe you when you say you�ve never driven before. A blind man could see you�ve never driven before.
JAMES=>I know. Step on the middle pedal.
JAMES=>My fault. I forgot to remind you about the clutch.
MIRANDA=>Maybe this works with other girls . . .
JAMES=>Trust me.
JAMES=>Not too many people know this, but
MIRANDA=>Why didn�t it pull anybody else I know?
JAMES=>It doesn�t attract everyone. Just hicks and hillbillies and a few rednecks. Songwriters. People who own cowboy hats, (CONT�D
JAMES=>guys with mustaches. If you have a pick-up, sometimes it�ll get pulled with you in it. Some people try to ignore it; they get used to the pull and just never come. My theory about you is that you�ve got this stray piece of hillbilly lodged in you, probably in one of your shoulders. You were smart not to fight it.
MIRANDA=>You know how you can have a job and an apartment and friends and you think, this is my life. If I leave this, I have no life.
JAMES=>Mmm. Turn right.
MIRANDA=>Well, I woke up a few weeks ago and it was really hot out and sunny and there were kids everywhere. It was the first day of summer vacation, and it was just like every other day to me. I wanted to be out, like they were. I just wanted out. And I thought, nothing�s holding me here, I can do whatever the hell I want. And if I don�t do it now, I�ll keep going
JAMES=>That happened to me when I was seventeen.
MIRANDA=>And I�ve always wanted to see Graceland.
JAMES=>How fast are you going?
MIRANDA=>About twenty?
JAMES=>Fourteen. Shift down and make a sharp right when I say now. . . . . Now.
JAMES=>Speed up.
JAMES=>Faster. Get into fourth.
MIRANDA=>Fourth? I can�t go that fast in a parking lot.
JAMES=>Promise me you won�t panic.
MIRANDA=>You�ve got a strange idea of a good time.
JAMES=>It�s better this way.
JAMES=>You can make up your own story.
MIRANDA=>I didn�t know there were this many stars.
JAMES=>Giant magnet. What�s your favorite song?
MIRANDA=>�Hooked on a Feeling�.
JAMES=>Me too.
MIRANDA=>Liar.
JAMES=>I think you can feel secure in your position as the only person on the planet whose favorite song is �Hooked on a Feeling�.
MIRANDA=>What�s yours?
JAMES=>Y.M.C.A.
MIRANDA=>Yeah. Me too.
JAMES=>What can you do that no one else can do?
MIRANDA=>Nothing.
JAMES=>There�s always something.
MIRANDA=>I can do a country version of any Bon Jovi song. Any Bon Jovi single. Except �Lay Your Hands on Me.� What about you?
JAMES=>I speak Spanish.
MIRANDA=>So do a billion other people.
JAMES=>Last month, I punched a record producer in the face.
MIRANDA=>I heard you shot him. Only he was a label executive.
JAMES=>See, you should never believe rumors.
MIRANDA=>So what happened?
JAMES=>I met this producer in Austin, who wanted to do some demos with me, try and get me a record deal. then as soon as we got into the studio, he started changing my songs, fucking with them so they�d sound more like everyone else. We had a fundamental difference of opinion. And he was a dick.
MIRANDA=>So you punched him.
JAMES=>I believe in doing what you feel like doing at any moment in time.
MIRANDA=>What�s it like, when you sing something you wrote?
JAMES=>Don�t you write songs?
MIRANDA=>No. I think I might try it, though. This singing thing isn�t really working out.
JAMES=>The first time I played one of my songs and people connected with it, it was like sex. Well, not exactly. Like the first time you kiss someone and your heart kind of flips, except it doesn�t make you feel weak, it makes you feel strong. If you think it�s something you want to do, you should try it.
MIRANDA=>I think it�s something I want to do.
MIRANDA=>Did I thank you for bringing glamour and excitement into my dreary life?
NICK=>Did you mess up another one?
MIRANDA=>Maybe it�s time to fish or cut bait.
NICK=>You know that Lyle Lovett song? Waltzing Fool?
MIRANDA=>Of course.
MIRANDA=>What about it?
NICK=>Nothing.
NICK=>Just might no be so crazy, that�s all.
MIRANDA=>I could do it better. Let me do it one more time.
KYLE=>No. I�m keeping that one.
MIRANDA=>We have fifteen minutes. I can do it better.
KYLE=>Miranda. That one was perfect. Wynonna Judd would use that one.
MIRANDA=>So what are you going to do with the demo?
KYLE=>They�ll put it on a list of available songs, and if someone comes in and wants something like this, they might listen to it.
MIRANDA=>That�s it? That�s how you�re getting it heard? That�s a great song, better than most of the stuff on the radio.
KYLE=>They all sound that way at first, when you�re the only one who�s ever hear it.
MIRANDA=>I�m telling you, someone wants this song. Wynonna Judd want this song, she just doesn�t know it yet.
KYLE=>If that�s true, she�ll find out soon enough.
MIRANDA=>O.K. It�s your song. I�m going to say two more words.
KYLE=>Two words.
MIRANDA=>No wonder.
KYLE=>No wonder I can�t get anything recorded? No wonder I�ll be just another guy who never did what he said he was going to? No wonder I work in a record store? Because I didn�t push my songs on every singer I met?
KYLE=>For your information, I stopped putting all my energy into every new song because I didn�t want to be so damned disappointed all the time.
MIRANDA=>Kyle. . .
KYLE=>What do you think I should do?
MIRANDA=>I think you should - we should - take this song to Wynonna and get her to listen to
KYLE=>What, right now?
MIRANDA=>Are you sure this is the right house? She parks right out front? Anyone could break into her car.
KYLE=>I guess we�re the only ones who thought of it. It�s her house. I came to a party here once.
MIRANDA=>So you�re in her social circle, but we have to lurk around at dawn to give her a tape.
KYLE=>I was parking cars, and this wasn�t my idea.
MIRANDA=>Give me the thing.
KYLE=>The thing? I thought you had done this before.
MIRANDA=>What do you think I am, a criminal? I�ve see it done. My sixth-grade boyfriend is
KYLE=>O.K. Time to go.
MIRANDA=>That was a joke. He got probation.
MIRANDA=>Give me the tape.
KYLE=>Shit. Let�s go.
MIRANDA=>Wait. Let me put the tape in.
KYLE=>Take that out. It has my name on it.
MIRANDA=>How else is she going to know whose song it is?
KYLE=>But she�ll know I broke into her car.
MIRANDA=>Of course she will. That�s the one drawback to the plan.
KYLE=>I can�t believe I didn�t think of that.
MIRANDA=>Don�t people ignore these things anymore?
KYLE=>Where�s the eject?
MIRANDA=>And when did the cops start responding so quickly?
MIRANDA=>I told you, we weren�t trying to steal anything. We were giving her a tape.
MIRANDA=>It was my idea.
KYLE=>At least you admit that.
MIRANDA=>Why are you mad at me? You agreed to it.
MIRANDA=>Any idiot would have figured out the one the one drawback.
POLICEMAN=>. . . and my daughter just loves your last album. I like that one you did with your mama . . .
POLICMAN=>These here are your perpetrators.
KYLE=>Hi. Kyle Davidson. It�s a pleasure to meet you.
KYLE=>This is Miranda Presley.
MIRANDA=>Hi.
WYNONNA=>Kind of polite for hardened criminals. Which one of you jimmied open my car door?
KYLE=>We weren�t trying to steal it . . .
KYLE=>Yours was the only car we broke into
WYNONNA=>Well, I�m flattered. I just wish I wasn�t flattered this early in the morning. Is your phone number on the tape?
WYNONNA=>I�ll have my manager give you a call about putting it on hold.
POLICEMAN=>Miss Judd? Do you want to press charges?
WYNONNA=>All I want is to get some sleep.
MIRANDA=>I�m having trouble even getting started. Maybe I can�t do it.
JAMES=>You learned how to drive two weeks ago and you�re already the best driver I know.
MIRANDA=>Writing songs is different.
JAMES=>Maybe you need to try it with your eyes closed.
MIRANDA=>Tried it. Didn�t work.
JAMES=>When�s your night off?
MIRANDA=>Wednesday.
JAMES=>Wednesday. I�ll show you a few tricks. But you have to promise not to get better than me.
NICK=>Check, check. Lucy . . . Lucy? Is this working right?
LUCY=>The microphone is fine, Nick.
NICK=>You�re pretty fine, yourself, Lucy.
MIRANDA=>Can I ask you something?
LUCY=>If you think there�s something you don�t already know.
MIRANDA=>How long has he been after you like this?
LUCY=>A little over a year.
MIRANDA=>And you�ve never even gone out with him?
LUCY=>I expect you�ll keep asking me about this until you hear the whole sorry story.
LUCY=>I met Nick about. . . eight years ago. My husband and him. . .
MIRANDA=>Your husband?
LUCY=>My husband played guitar in Nick�s band. Nick started acting pretty much the way he acts now, only then I was young and didn�t have much sense.
LUCY=>I eventually left my husband and took up with him
MIRANDA=>What happened?
LUCY=>Nick got a record deal. He cut an album and went on tour. His first night on the road, he called me up and started talking about. . . what was it, Nick? Space?
LUCY=>Well, his album didn�t exactly set any sales records, and his record label dropped him. Before I knew it he was hanging around here, thinking I was fool enough to take him back.
MIRANDA=>Maybe he�s learned his lesson.
LUCY=>He hasn�t said anything so far to make me think he�s learned one damn thing. I�m
LUCY=>Get off my stage, Nick.
KYLE=>I told Linda Lue I�d pick you up. I thought we might celebrate.
KYLE=>Any idiot would have figured out the one drawback. Miranda smiles.
KYLE=>It�s lucky for both of us that my song was so good, or we�d be in jail right now.
MIRANDA=>It�s lucky for you that I sang on that demo.
MIRANDA=>You�ll have to show me that sometime.
KYLE=>Thanks, buddy.
MIRANDA=>Not bad.
KYLE=>Not bad? Not bad!
MIRANDA=>You�re Johnny Cash. You�re Vince Gill. You�re George Strait.
KYLE=>You know what�s funny?
KYLE=>The first time I saw you, I didn�t even realize how beautiful you were.
MIRANDA=>Just once, I�d like a sober man to call me beautiful.
KYLE=>It�s not just that, it�s you. I didn�t even care that I got arrested, really, because I was with you. You know how I got better at that song?
KYLE=>I thought about you. About everything I wanted to tell you about how I feel. And I was sober at the time, I promise.
MIRANDA=>So you realize there�s a song for everything that happens in life? Sometimes there are dozens for one moment in time, like now. Yours could be that REO Speedwagon song about wanting to be more than friends, and mine could be �Baby don�t get hooked on me.�
KYLE=>I�ve always hated that song.
MIRANDA=>I got you arrested and I�ll always remind you of a song that you hate. That should be two strike against me.
KYLE=>Don�t count on it.
MIRANDA=>I think you�re mistaken about how easy it is to amuse me. It�s harder than this.
JAMES=>We�re not here to amuse you, we�re her to get you some inspiration. Look at him.
JAMES=>Waiting for his wife. The woman he married when she was barely seventeen. The woman he loves just as much today as the day he met her.
MIRANDA=>You could write a song from that?
JAMES=>No. Not me. I don�t write about everlasting love.
MIRANDA=>Say he�s waiting for Gregor, his thirty- year-old Dutch lover. They met in Venice last Valentine�s day, and have been apart since then.
JAMES=>How come?
MIRANDA=>Howard over there had to have his wife killed, and her collection of exotic parrots converted into hatbands.
JAMES=>Should be a touching reunion. Not a country song, though. What about him?
MIRANDA=>He married his high school sweetheart, they have a lovely home and a wonderful marriage, or so everyone think. She�s returning from a Mary Kay convention.
JAMES=>Or so she says. That has possibilities.
JAMES=>Watch him.
MIRANDA=>Let�s go.
JAMES=>What�s the matter?
MIRANDA=>Nothing.
JAMES=>O.K. You don�t have to tell me.
MIRANDA=>I hate that. Someone goes away for two weeks and it�s like the end of the fucking world.
JAMES=>What�s wrong with missing someone?
MIRANDA=>If you know they�re coming back, you have no right to miss them. It�s not like they�re dead.
JAMES=>I remember when my grandfather died. I kept waiting for him to come to Sunday dinner.
MIRANDA=>How old were you?
JAMES=>Twenty.
MIRANDA=>That�s my dad.
JAMES=>He looks just like Elvis.
MIRANDA=>That is Elvis. He gave me this when I was ten. My decitennial accolade, he called it. He raised me since I was five. Just me and him.
MIRANDA=>Presley�s my middle name. He had this kind of Elvis thing. Nothing weird.
JAMES=>When did he die?
MIRANDA=>Three months ago.
JAMES=>That�s not very long. It�s only natural that you miss him.
MIRANDA=>I don�t miss him. He told me not to.
MIRANDA=>O.K.
MIRANDA=>When I get married, I�m going to have them play �Bad Medicine� as I walk down the aisle. The Bon Jovi version.
JAMES=>Why do you always stay up all night?
MIRANDA=>Linda Lue snores.
JAMES=>Are you afraid of the dark?
MIRANDA=>If I was afraid on the dark, I wouldn�t spend so much time in the dark, would I?
JAMES=>Nightmares?
MIRANDA=>Not since I was eight.
JAMES=>What�d you do then, when you a nightmare?
MIRANDA=>I would wake up my dad, he�d come get me, and he�d let me stay up all night. We�d light candles and make cookies and play poker. We used to crank call foreign countries. I learned the twist at four in the morning. Then when it got light out, I�d go to bed and miss half a day of school. My dad once wrote a not for me; �Miranda was unavoidably late to school today due to a slight pterodactyl crisis at home. The problem has been remedied and it is unlikely that this will happen again.�
JAMES=>So you�ve been sleeping during the day since he died?
MIRANDA=>At first, I couldn�t sleep at all, then the only time I could even remember what he looked like was in the middle of the night. I sometimes think about what I�ll say when I see him again, and if I�ll recognize him, then I realize I won�t see him again at all.
MIRANDA=>I�ve been thinking about something.
MIRANDA=>I wonder if I�ll know you in a year.
JAMES=>I don�t know.
MIRANDA=>If we go out, and we break up, I probably won�t. I�ll be just another girl you used to go out with. And someday there�ll be so many you won�t know which one I was.
JAMES=>You want me to say we�ll be together in a year? Because I can�t say that.
MIRANDA=>No. That�s not what I want.
JAMES=>You don�t want to do this.
MIRANDA=>I don�t think it�s a good idea.
JAMES=>I�m going to have to ask you to tell me why.
MIRANDA=>I told you.
JAMES=>I need the real reason. Then we�ll be friends or whatever it is you want.
MIRANDA=>I�ve been trying to write a song. Just one song, to prove I can do it. Not even a good song. And you, you see two strangers at an airport and you turn it into something so. . . incredible. Your song was incredible.
JAMES=>What, you�re jealous? I might not even finish that song. I have a song I started three years ago that�s not done yet.
MIRANDA=>I�m not jealous. I�m overwhelmed. I just can�t give you that, see?
JAMES=>I don�t care.
MIRANDA=>I do.
LUCY=>You can leave if you want, honey.
MIRANDA=>Lucy, do you think anyone can be a songwriter
LUCY=>I�ve seen some people who tried about as hard as a person can try and just never get it, you know? I don�t think you can learn it. I can�t do it.
LUCY=>I didn�t mean to bring you down.
MIRANDA=>I always thought I wanted to be a singer, then I came hear and realized I like to sing, but it doesn�t seem like enough. But songwriting�s so different; I just don�t know if it�s worth it to try. It comes so easily to some people, like James.
LUCY=>You know what�s in this case?
LUCY=>These are all songs, by my songwriters. They�re not all hits, but they�re special songs. �Like a miracle, some golden words roll off of someone�s tongue.� Some of the took ten minutes, some if them took years. Every one of these songwriters would tell you it�s worth it. You write a song like one of these, and you can�t ever give up again. You know what it feels like to be special, and there�s nothing
LUCY=>That�s why I worry about you, being with James.
MIRANDA=>James and I decided we�d just be friends.
LUCY=>It doesn�t matter how wonderful he is if he�s only going to break you heart.
MIRANDA=>Yeah, that�s what I decided. I�ll see you tomorrow.
LUCY=>Goodnight, honey.
MIRANDA=>How�s he doing?
KYLE=>Great.
LINDA LUE=>Hey, good, you made it. Come and dance. This old stick-in-the-mud
MIRANDA=>Do you know how to do that?
KYLE=>Sure.
MIRANDA=>Come on and show me how.
JAMES=>O.K. Thank you. We�re going to do one more for you all tonight. I�ve got a special guest singer on this number.
JAMES=>Her name�s Miranda Presley and I think you�re gonna like her.
LINDA LUE=>Go on up, Miranda.
JAMES=>Miranda, get on up here.
JAMES=>You know this one.
KYLE=>Yeah. He�s a good manager, been around for twenty years. He has a good reputation.
JAMES=>He wants to do some master demos with me.
KYLE=>That�s great. He can get you a record deal. Congratulations.
JAMES=>Thanks.
MIRANDA=>Congratulations.
JAMES=>Come here a minute.
JAMES=>Do you have the feeling that no matter how conclusively we decide not to be attracted to each other, forces beyond our control will pull us together?
MIRANDA=>You think the entire universe is controlled by magnets, don�t you?
JAMES=>Yes and no.
MIRANDA=>We�ve been thinking about moving out of the motel, but we don�t have any furniture, and the dog seems to like it, and they wrap the glasses in cellophane, even though Lou always washes them again before she lets me drink out of them.
JAMES=>I need for you to shut up now.
MIRANDA=>Why?
JAMES=>I�m trying to picture you as Earlene Mandrell, and you don�t sound a think like her.
MIRANDA=>Well, lucky for me, you sound exactly like Jim Nabors.
JAMES=>I really need for you to shut up now.
JAMES=>Maybe I�ll start staying up all night. The best things in my life happen after dark. He passes by her, pulling back her shirt to kiss her shoulder, and sits at the table. She keeps playing quietly.
MIRANDA=>Lucy told me you�d break my heart.
JAMES=>I guess you didn�t believe her.
MIRANDA=>Maybe I just decided to risk it.
JAMES=>How�s your song coming?
MIRANDA=>I have one line.
JAMES=>Every song starts with one line.
MIRANDA=>I don�t know if it�s any good. My dad always said I could do anything. I keep thinking about this song he wrote for me.
JAMES=>Do you remember it? She nods.
JAMES=>Let me hear it.
JAMES=>That�s a nice line, about falling out of the sky and landing in love.
MIRANDA=>Is that the only thing you liked?
JAMES=>It�s just. . . well, devotion is a tricky theme. Of course a parent�s devoted to his child. You have to have a point of
JAMES=>view. Like he wants a better life for you than he had for himself. This song starts at the end of the story.
MIRANDA=>Every song doesn�t have to be about something you can relate to.
JAMES=>A good song has something to say, even to people who haven�t been in that situation.
JAMES=>I�m just telling you what I thought. I�ve spent half my life writing songs, I know something about it. I thought you were trying to learn.
MIRANDA=>If you had thought about it, you would
VOICE=>And I gave Fish-head four gallons of ice cream for dinner, just like you said. Of was that supposed to be one can of cat food? I couldn�t remember, and Fish-head insists that she always has ice cream on Thursday. She also said to tell you she misses you, and she caught a giant spider that I thought looked a lot like that Billy Warren kid you think is so cute. I told her you�d be home soon. Remember, if you get homesick, just keep your chin up. . .
MIRANDA=>How many people will be here?
KYLE=>Five or six. Everyone just plays something they�re working on. Don�t worry, no one�s going to insult your song. They�ll only say what they like about it.
MIRANDA=>What if they don�t say anything?
KYLE=>There are so many things a person can do with her life. That girl in �Flashdance� was a welder.
MIRANDA=>Do you think they�ll notice if I play �Livin� on a Prayer�?
MIRANDA=>I don�t like that last line.
ERICA=>No. Keep that one. I like that line.
MIRANDA=>I�m not sure what it means.
NICK=>If you wrote it, you�ll figure out what it means eventually. That�s the best line in your song.
LINDA LUE=>Oh good, you got in. Are you coming to the audition today?
MIRANDA=>I don�t know. I don�t think my song is ready.
LINDA LUE=>Has it changed any in the last two weeks?
MIRANDA=>Yeah, but I changed it back.
MIRANDA=>Fine. I�ll go.
MIRANDA=>What are you looking for?
LINDA LUE=>Signs of aging.
MIRANDA=>Find any?
LINDA LUE=>Well, I like Barry Manilow more than I used to. You know what I don�t get?
MIRANDA=>What?
LINDA LUE=>You and James. You have one little spat and you don�t call him and he doesn�t call you.
MIRANDA=>I guess we both realized our mistake.
LINDA LUE=>I thought you really liked him
MIRANDA=>That was the mistake.
LUCY=>Miranda Presley.
LUCY=>Linda Lue Linden, go on up and show us your stuff, honey.
LINDA LUE=>Hi there. I�m Linda Lue, from Alabama. This song is called �I went looking for Jesus.�
JAMES=>I like you song.
JAMES=>I�ve missed you.
MIRANDA=>Since my phone still ain�t ringin�, I assume it still ain�t you.
JAMES=>I�m sorry I didn�t call. I couldn�t call you, I don�t now. That night, after we made love. . .
MIRANDA=>Look, it wasn�t that big a deal. You�ve apologized. Let�s forget it, O.K.?
JAMES=>It wasn�t just my fault, you know.
JAMES=>You said you were willing to risk it, but you weren�t.
MIRANDA=>I�m sorry.
JAMES=>I should have told you that night. . .
JAMES=>You should have passed.
MIRANDA=>I knew it wasn�t ready. I can do it better.
LUCY=>Hey, I thought you did real good today.
MIRANDA=>You�re supposed to pass the ones you like.
LUCY=>You know why I bought my own place?
MIRANDA=>So you could play God.
LUCY=>That�s exactly right, honey. I think you got a real good start, but I wouldn�t be doing you any favors if I let you play this soon.
MIRANDA=>Oh, I brought you something.
LUCY=>What�s this?
MIRANDA=>If I tell you to just trust me and listen to this, will you?
MIRANDA=>It�s Nick, a song of his. I think you should hear it.
LINDA LUE=>And there�s prizes, and scholarships, and the winner goes to the Miss Tennessee pageant.
MIRANDA=>I hope you won�t be insulted if I tell you I already think of you as Miss Nashville. What about your illustrious songwriting career?
LINDA LUE=>You have no way of knowing this, since you are asleep during most of my waking hours, but I have been having serious doubts about my future as a songwriter, which has been my one goal since I was eleven years old and saw �Coal Miner�s Daughter� for the first time.
LINDA LUE=>But lately I�ve been thinking about something my late grandmother Tilly use
LINDA LUE=>Lately I�ve been feeling more like that hen. If I thought I could really do it, that might be another story.
MIRANDA=>The pageant�s next week? Do you have time to get ready? Don�t people train for months for these things?
LINDA LUE=>Miranda, I believe it is within my ability to learn to walk in high heel, discuss
LINDA LUE=>the role of the woman in today�s society, and tease my hair in one week.
MIRANDA=>If you could have one wish for today�s children, what would it be?
LINDA LUE=>World peace. No, clean air.
MIRANDA=>You wouldn�t want them to be sick, or go hungry, would you?
LINDA LUE=>What do I care? I hate kids.
MIRANDA=>You�re beautiful and queen-like, Lou. You�re a beauty queen. You�ve got this locked up.
DOUG ROBERTS,=>the manager who gave James his card at the Roadhouse, sits in the booth with the engineer. The musicians are all in their thirties and forties; most of them look like somebody�s father. They�re doing one of the songs we�ve heard James do before, but this version seems to lack energy. James is clearly dissatisfied with the way things are going, but is trying to be patient. He stops singing in the middle of the song and cuts the band.
JAMES=>We need to bring up the snares.
JAMES=>This tempo�s all wrong.
DOUG=>Don�t worry. It sounds great.
JAMES=>I�m not deaf. I can tell how it sounds.
DOUG=>We�ll just get it down once this way, o.k. James?
JAMES=>No. That�s not the way I wrote it.
DOUG=>James, I know you feel strongly about your
JAMES=>I know what shit sounds like.
DOUG=>It doesn�t sound like shit. It sounds like what every country radio station is looking for. I have to think in terms of radio play.
JAMES=>I record this the way I wrote it, or I don�t record it at all.
DOUG=>I�m already taking a big risk with you. . .
JAMES=>Don�t do me any favors.
DOUG=>Go ahead. Walk out. No one else will touch you. Everyone knows about you.
JAMES=>What does everyone know about me?
DOUG=>You�ve got a hell of an attitude for a pretty boy with a couple of good songs.
MIRANDA=>I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States. . .
LINDA LUE=>I think it�s highly unlikely I�ll be reciting the pledge of allegiance.
LINDA LUE=>Much less with a Bible on my head.
MIRANDA=>I would think this is exactly the kind of thing you�d be doing. I still think you should learn that tap dance to �Dixie.� Come on out.
MIRANDA=>Oh, you look beautiful.
LINDA LUE=>You think so? Is it enough?
MIRANDA=>Yes. It�s enough.
LINDA LUE=>It�s not too much?
MIRANDA=>No. You look perfect. Except. . . let me try one thing.
MIRANDA=>Better. Wait.
MIRANDA=>What did you do, follow some kind of eyeliner diagram in the beauty queen handbook?
LINDA LUE=>I�ll be on stage, I want them to see my eyes.
MIRANDA=>They will see your eyes. On the other girls, all they�ll see is eyeliner.
LINDA LUE=>You�re my best friend, you know.
MIRANDA=>Yeah, well that�s cause you�re such a sap, Lou.
NICK=>Goodnight, Lucy.
LUCY=>Goodnight.
NICK=>I don�t suppose you want to go out with me tomorrow night.
LUCY=>Tomorrow night?
LUCY=>What time?
NICK=>Eight o�clock.
LUCY=>Eight o�clock. That�ll be fine.
NICK=>Goodnight, then.
JAMES=>Hey. I got your note.
MIRANDA=>I never miss a jamboree.
LINDA LUE=>Hey, James. How�s your career coming?
JAMES=>I punched an influential member of the record industry in the face.
MIRANDA=>We know.
JAMES=>Again. Today.
MIRANDA=>Oh. What happened?
JAMES=>I�ll tell you on the way.
MIRANDA=>On the way where?
JAMES=>It�s a surprise.
MIRANDA=>This had better be better than the jamboree.
MIRANDA=>So when do I find out the surprise?
JAMES=>There are clues everywhere. We�re in a truck, on the highway. . .
MIRANDA=>You�re talking me somewhere.
JAMES=>Clue.
MIRANDA=>Graceland? Graceland! Way cool.
JAMES=>You do not know what it is to worship Elvis until you�ve seen his personal shit.
MIRANDA=>They should put that on a plaque and hand it on the gate.
JAMES=>We�ll drive by the gate. I thought you would want to see it at night.
MIRANDA=>They think you�re proposing.
MIRANDA=>Get up.
JAMES=>Say yes first.
MIRANDA=>Yes to what?
JAMES=>Say yes, or I�ll look like a loser.
MIRANDA=>You are kind of a loser.
JAMES=>Happy? I�m the happiest man on earth!
JAMES=>His aunt still lives there.
MIRANDA=>I bet she used the TV room at night.
JAMES=>I would.
JAMES=>You know what this reminds me of?
JAMES=>When I was a kid, my dad used to take me out every weekend. Told my mom we were
JAMES=>And I�d sit in the car, we had a blue Pontiac, and he�d leave me the keys, and I�d listen to the radio.
JAMES=>Just like all those damn cheating songs. And all my life, people would tell me, �James, you�re just like your father.� And I never said it but I thought, no I�m not. I never lie. I don�t pretend to be a great guy. The high point of my father�s life was a football game in high school. No way was I going to be just like him. But now I wonder if I can help I it.
JAMES=>Sometimes I feel like I�m going to spend the rest of my life with everyone thinking I�m someone I�m not.
MIRANDA=>It�s hard to think about what you�re going to do for the rest of your life. You have
JAMES=>You look stupid. You�re a failure.
MIRANDA=>I don�t think you could ever be a failure.
MIRANDA=>So am I.
JAMES=>Do you feel that?
MIRANDA=>Yeah.
SELMA=>Look, Mary, if it ain�t the newlyweds.
MARY=>You two get married already?
JAMES=>No. We couldn�t find an all-night wedding chapel.
MIRANDA=>Well, maybe if you had any sense at all, you might have planned this a little better and we wouldn�t have gotten lost in the rain.
JAMES=>I know she�s a handful, but I�d die if I lost her.
MIRANDA=>That�s cause you�d forget to breathe if I didn�t remind you.
MARY=>Well, if you�re sure, maybe I can help you. Selma, you can cover me for five minutes?
SELMA=>Sure can. You gonna wake Raymond?
MARY=>I�m going to wake that man and tell him there�s two young folks here and can�t wait till morning to get married.
SELMA=>She�ll be right back, she just lives down the street.
MIRANDA=>Who�s Raymond?
SELMA=>Raymond�s her husband. He�s a minister. This is so romantic.
JAMES=>Cold feet, honey?
MIRANDA=>I left. . . something blue in the truck. Come with me.
MIRANDA=>Let�s go.
JAMES=>We can�t just go. We have to at least tell them we changed our mind.
JAMES=>I�ve got another idea.
JAMES=>Let�s get married.
MIRANDA=>You don�t get married as a joke.
JAMES=>It�s not a joke. We�re in love. What the hell, let�s get married.
MIRANDA=>You�re serious.
JAMES=>We are in love, aren�t we?
MIRANDA=>Yeah.
JAMES=>Then why haven�t you ever told me?
MIRANDA=>You�re the one who had to write it on my hand.
JAMES=>I love you.
MIRANDA=>I can�t say it.
JAMES=>Why not?
MIRANDA=>I�d be afraid to tell you how much.
JAMES=>Jesus.
MIRANDA=>Oh my god.
JAMES=>Marry me, Miranda
MIRANDA=>O.K. Yes.
MIRANDA=>I don�t see an alternative.
MIRANDA=>I have chee-tos stuck in my teeth.
JAMES=>You know, this is exactly how I pictured my wedding.
MIRANDA=>Yeah, mine too. Except. . . oh, shit.
MIRANDA=>The ring. See you at the altar. Aisle twelve.
RAYMOND=>Here�s your marriage license. Can�t no one tell you for certain that�s not the genuine article.
MIRANDA=>Thank you.
MIRANDA=>Ben, I need a favor.
MIRANDA=>Do you have a Bon Jovi tape?
BEN=>Bon Jovi�s for girls, man. I ain�t a girl. My sister likes Bon Jovi.
MIRANDA=>Does your sister have a Bon Jovi tape?
BEN=>She�s got every Bon Jovi tape.
MARY=>Ben, where are you? Get out here and be a witness.
BEN=>Coming
RAYMOND=>Do you, James, take this woman to be your wife, to love and treasure like gold, forsaking all others, turning your back on earthly temptations, or you will surely know the fires of hell in the inferno of eternal damnation.
JAMES=>I do.
RAYMOND=>And do you, Miranda, take James to be your husband. . . .
MIRANDA=>I do.
RAYMOND=>Then by the power vested in my by Almighty God, his son, our savior, the baby Jesus, and the state of Tennessee, I hereby pronounce you man. . .
RAYMOND=>. . . and wife.
RAYMOND=>You may kiss the bride.
MIRANDA=>I had this dream that we got married.
JAMES=>We did, remember?
MIRANDA=>No. Me and Elvis. I had my hair in a huge bee-hive.
MIRANDA=>We picked up a hitchhiker that turned out to be the ghost of Elvis. Had to take him to Graceland. She�s a finalist?
KYLE=>She was the best one. People were crying when she did her scene.
MIRANDA=>So she�s going to win?
KYLE=>I don�t know. I think that redhead is married to at least one of the judges.
HOST=>And now, our last finalist, Louise Linden.
HOST=>You look lovely tonight, Louise.
LINDA LUE=>Well, that�s the idea, ain�t it?
HOST=>Yes, it is. Now, Louise, here�s your question: Which do you consider more important, family or career?
LINDA LUE=>By family you mean the family I plan to have.
HOST=>Yes.
LINDA LUE=>Well in that case, I would say neither.
HOST=>Thank you. A very good answer.
HOST=>And this year�s Miss Nashville is. . . Tammy Sue Phelps!
MIRANDA=>Congratulations. Personally, I thought you should have won.
LINDA LUE=>I can�t believe they gave me runner-up after I said that about screaming kids.
MIRANDA=>You threw it? Cool. How come?
LINDA LUE=>Did you see my talent?
MIRANDA=>No. James and I got married. We got here late.
LINDA LUE=>I was really good. I found something I can do, Miranda. I can�t spend a year cutting ribbons at supermarket openings.
MIRDANA=>Well, you�ll always be a beauty queen to me.
DEE-JAY=>. . . . we�ve all been waiting for, here�s the new one from Wynonna.
KYLE=>That�s my song.
DRIVER=>That�s his song. He�s got a song on the radio!
LUCY=>You�re early.
MIRANDA=>I am?
LUCY=>You and James? Congratulations!
MIRANDA=>I thought you might disapprove.
LUCY=>Well, honey, I got me a whole new attitude on the subject of love.
MIRANDA=>This can�t be from Nick. You can�t even tolerate Nick. You�re never going to forgive him for as long as you live.
LUCY=>I changed my mind.
MIRANDA=>I tried to tell you about that song.
LUCY=>I don�t know why he didn�t just come out and tell me how he really felt.
MIRANDA=>Maybe the same reason you didn�t tell him.
LUCY=>We�re having an engagement party Friday. We�d like you to sing.
MIRANDA=>O.K.
LUCY=>Original material only.
MIRANDA=>Oh. I don�t have anything good enough
LUCY=>Well, you�ve got two days. You�ll come up with something.
MIRANDA=>When did you turn into such an optimist?
LUCY=>I have to admit, I�m starting to believe in happy endings. Looks at you and James - I never did figure that boy to be the type to commit.
MIRANDA=>It kind of happened when he wasn�t looking.
LUCY=>I don�t think he does anything without looking first. If he said �I do� , then he does.
MIRANDA=>Hey. I know you.
JAMES=>Can you take a break?
MIRANDA=>Not right now.
JAMES=>You want to know what I did today?
MIRANDA=>What did you do today?
JAMES=>I went to see Doug. I told him he�d be all kinds of sorry if he let me get away. That kind of line works like you wouldn�t believe. Miranda smiles.
MIRANDA=>I might.
JAMES=>I leave for Austin day after tomorrow. I start recording next week.
MIRANDA=>Austin? You�re aware you�re already in the country music recording capital of the world.
JAMES=>I get to use my musicians this time. This is everything I wanted. I thought you�d be happy for me.
MIRANDA=>How long will you be gone?
JAMES=>I don�t know. A month or two.
MIRANDA=>You�re just taking off? Day after tomorrow. And you aren�t going to ask me if I want to come.
JAMES=>What does it mean?
JAMES=>I�m not even sure we are married, so if you want out, just let me know. I can tear up the certificate.
MIRANDA=>Don�t pull this on me. You�re the one who�s leaving. Maybe you�ve gotten what you wanted out of this. You proved to yourself that you could commit to something. Well, a commitment lasts more than two days.
JAMES=>You think you�ve got me all figured out.
MIRANDA=>Maybe you can only commit to one thing at a time. I guess we know what your one thing is.
JAMES=>You�re the one who can�t see past two months from now. I don�t think you can see this marriage in a week from now.
MIRANDA=>I just don�t think there�ll be anything to see.
LINDA LUE=>Hey, you. I thought you were going to sleep through my departure.
MIRANDA=>And miss the opportunity to see another piece of my life crumble away?
LINDA LUE=>Do you want to tell me what happened with you and James?
MIRANDA=>I think the marriage just woke him up. We realized he didn�t want to be with me for the rest of his life. The wedding thing was a big mistake.
LINDA LUE=>And you didn�t have any second thoughts of your own.
MIRANDA=>He�s the one who left me.
LINDA LUE=>Can I tell you a story?
MIRANDA=>How many people die in this story?
LINDA LUE=>Just one. When my Aunt Lydia was eighteen, she was engaged to marry Henry Esterbrook. However, the week before the wedding, Henry eloped with Marianna Fine. Aunt Lydia was so devastated she thought she�d rather be dead than be without Henry, so she decided to hang herself.
MIRANDA=>Has it occurred to you that this story is completely inappropriate for this situation?
LINDA LUE=>There�s more. Lydia went to the hardware store to buy a length of good strong rope, she couldn�t have weighed less than two hundred pounds, and the man that sold her that rope turned out to be her destiny. She married him that summer. My Uncle Ernie.
MIRANDA=>Which one of them dies?
LINDA LUE=>My Uncle Ernie was bitten by a poison centipede later that same year. He died instantly. But that is beside the point and you know it. There is someone out there for everyone, and even if your head doesn�t know it, your heart does.
MIRANDA=>So her heart led her to the hardware store.
LINDA LUE=>Just like yours took to Memphis.
MIRANDA=>Yeah. But you didn�t read my heart line.
LINDA LUE=>Sometimes people want to be surprised.
LINDA LUE=>See, it�s the same as before. You are not one to settle for the easiest thing - I think that�s true. A challenging relationship. . . that can be very romantic; to me that seemed like you and James, both of you so pig-headed.
MIRANDA=>This isn�t helping.
LINDA LUE=>The important thing to know is to follow your heart. Don�t go against what it�s telling you, and don�t bury anything that ain�t dead.
MIRANDA=>Who�s going to die now?
LINDA LUE=>No one that you don�t kill with your own two hands. You know, maybe next week would be a better time for me to leave.
MIRANDA=>No, honestly, I couldn�t stand you or Mr. Buster Dog another day. Go to Hollywood
KYLE=>I don�t know how productive this was . . .
MIRANDA=>Well, I�m having a pretty good time. Let�s go somewhere else. Wanna go to Graceland?
KYLE=>Let�s get you home.
MIRANDA=>I don�t get it.
MIRANDA=>This whole thing. What�s the matter with me?
KYLE=>Nothing. You are perfect.
MIRANDA=>No. There�s something wrong with me. Nobody wants me. Nobody cares about me.
KYLE=>I care. I care about you.
MIRANDA=>Do you love me?
KYLE=>Miranda, don�t ask me that right now.
KYLE=>Yes.
KYLE=>I don�t know what you�re doing, but stop it now. I won�t let you use me.
MIRANDA=>I�m sorry. Really.
KYLE=>Damn it, Miranda, what do you want me to do?
MIRANDA=>I don�t know. I want you to stay in love with me always, and I want you to get over me and be my friend forever.
KYLE=>Do you think I have some kind of choice?
KYLE=>Sometimes you hear a song on the radio, and it�s just the song you wanted to hear right then. It�s like a gift. Then it�s over, and you�re just glad you heard it. You don�t want them to play it again right away. You�ll hear that song again, or another one that�s just the perfect song when you hear it.
MIRANDA=>And I�m like that song, the first one.
KLYE=>No, you are nothing like that first one. You�re like if there was only one song in the world I could hear for the rest of my life, what song would that be. You�re that song.
KYLE=>You�re the song that stays in my head all day, and I don�t even mind it. You�re my favorite song.
MIRANDA=>For awhile, my favorite song was �Shadow Dancin��. It�s not anymore.
MIRANDA=>No he won�t. It�s o.k. This kind of thing happens to me all the time.
KYLE=>Miranda. What are you going to do when he comes back?
MIRANDA=>I�m not going to be here. I�m going back home.
KYLE=>This is your home.
MIRANDA=>Do you know how hard it was to leave New York? I had wanted to do it for years and
KYLE=>Don�t think that. You can�t live your life thinking that.
MIRANDA=>Kyle, all the signs are pointing in the same direction. Away from Nashville. Away from country music. At some point, I have to pay attentions. I have to start again.
KYLE=>You could do that here. You didn�t come here because of your father. You came here to write songs.
MIRANDA=>Saying you�re going to do something and actually doing it are two different things.
KYLE=>You have them inside you. What if you go to New York and you never get them out?
MIRANDA=>Don�t make me feel any worse. This is all I have left.
KYLE=>You still have everything that matters.
JAMES=>. . . thinks she knows everything about me. Probably thinks I decided to leave because of her, like the world revolves around her . . . she thought she had me with that marriage thing . . . I might have better things to do with the rest of my life . . .
HITCHHIKER=>Like what?
WAITRESS=>You�ve been asleep for an hour. I�ve been watching your stuff, but my shift�s over now.
MIRANDA=>Thanks.
JAMES=>Is Miranda here?
LUCY=>No, honey, I�m sorry.
LUCY=>She told me she was going back to New York.
LUCY=>She left this morning.
LUCY=>Honey, why don�t you sit down. I�ll get you some champagne.
JAMES=>Beer.
JAMES=>Congratulations.
NICK=>Thank you.
JAMES=>You want some advice from an old married man? Don�t leave her.
NICK=>The important thing is you came back for her. No matter what happens, you did the
LUCY=>Kyle Davidson. Thank you, Kyle.
LUCY=>Now, this next performer is kind of special to me, and I�m real glad she could make it here tonight. Here she is, Miranda Presley.
JAMES=>I did, but I came back. I thought you had left.
MIRANDA=>I did, but I came back.
MIRANDA=>What�s this?
