DIRECTOR=>Neurology lab? He doesn't laugh at Sayer, just at the thought of it.
DIRECTOR=>We have an x-ray room. Sayer tries to share the Director's amusement with a good- * natured smile, but doesn't really understand it. Kaufman seems * to have less time for this, and in plain English, unadorned - *
KAUFMAN=>- The-position-ds-Staff-^Neurologist. .
DIRECTOR=>A doctor ... doctor.
KAUFMAN=>It can't.
SAYER=>Well, I know that now. I proved it.
DR. KAUFMAN=>- It's still a reflex.
SAYER=>What'd I forget?
DR. TYLER=>The smell of them.
OLD DOCTOR=>
SAYER=>What must it be like to be them?
MRS. LOWE=>
SAYER=>I'm beginning . . .
NEUROCHEMIST=>Are you speaking to me?
77A.CONT. KAUFMAN 77A.=>Sayer - Sayer turns. He was almost to the door. He had almost made * it out.
KAUFMAN=>That "immense" project of yours. The myelin? The worms? When that failed, what was the reaction of your lab supervisor?
SAYER=>He asked me to leave. . Kaufman nods like, Just checking. And - KAUFMAN . Good luck.
SAYER=>Yes, I'll call.
LEONARD=>Good, sir. !
SAYER=>I probably was.
SAYER=>What'd she say?
123A. OMITTED 123A.=>123B. INT- CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY 123B. * The corridor, and the sound of a woman's voice, very faint, . * from somewhere unseen: *
MMRRSS.. LLOOWWEE=>C -j He's not the same kind of patient.
LEONARD=>I'm staying here.
LEONARD=>I live here.
PAULA=>Does that make any sense?
PAULA=>Why are you here?
134.CONT.=>He doesn't know how to begin to explain it to her.
PAULA=>Thanks for talking to me. She steps away toward the door.
LEONARD=>Your father. He knows you visit him.
138A. OMITTED 138A.=>139. INT. ROSELAND - LATER - EVENING 139. The band in the middle of "You Hade Me Love You."
144.CONT. I=>A subterranean corridor. Deserted except for Sayer and Leonard moving along it. Past the boiler room. The pipes and ducts aabboovvee tthheemm..
BETH=>He's dead, this duke? NURSE 1 He's been dead a hundred years.
BETH=>Then forget it, I'm not curtsying. Lucy, wearing "stylish" new glasses, smiles as Sayer listens to her heartbeat through a stethoscope. Satisfied with it, he makes a notation in her chart.
LEONARD=>Wake up. 167-163. OMITTED 167-169 169A-. INT. ELEVATOR & CORRIDOR 169A.
ORDERLY=>I guess they're not hungry. Kaufman nods distractedly, not really listening. The orderly begins whistling a tune to himself. Kaufman glances over long- sufferingly, quieting him. The door slides open, and the young man wheels the cart past Kaufman. Finally: ~
KAUFMAN=>Who?
ORDERLY=>Ward 5.
LEONARD=>Then why are you in a cage?
KAUFMAN=>He's been OQ it longer! Sayer has no rejoinder. A silence before:
LEONARD=>How are you today?
SAYER=>Something's wrong.
LEONARD=>Hey, buddy. . SAYER * The drug's not working. These are * side-effects and they're consuming * you, and if we don't do - *
LEONARD=>Hey, I appreciate you coming to see me, I have some things to do.
SAYER=>r Look at yourself, Leonard. Leonard tries to pull his hand away, but Sayer's grasp is * stronger.
SAYER=>Look at yourself -
LEONARD=>I want to be back.
ANTHONY=>"You build me up, Buttercup, " Only to let me down ... " v
192.CONT. LEONARD U92.=>TThhee bbooookk lliisstt iiss ccoommiinngg aalloonngg..

LUCY'S VOICE=>â€ž There's a song at twilight , J When the lights are low
196B.CONT. 196B.=>Her voice CONTINUES the verse OVER: Rose, her sad strange china doll face.
196B.CONT.=>She glances across to the sunroom, to Leonard, still at the window, unaware, or so it seems, of her and the others.
196C.CONT. 196C.=>Sayer almost recoils, as if from a slap. Silence. Then: *
SAYER'S VOICE=>When did you realize it wasn't?
LEONARD O.S. O=>/T\ It's winter. *
BOY ON TRAIN=>We're going to the city. LEONARD . . Me, too. '
SAYER=>... Maybe we could just . . . go for a walk ... ?
HECTOR=>Broadway Joe. The driver glances back to see what Leonard thinks of that. * Leonard nods uncertainly.
LEONARD=>Yeah.
HECTOR=>Stay with us.
LEONARD=>I can't. And he can't explain why. He takes the crumpled wad of money * from his coat pocket and tries to give it to Hector again.
HECTOR=>Hey -
HECTOR=>I don't want it.
