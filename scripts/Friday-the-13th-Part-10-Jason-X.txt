JOHNSON=>Creepy, huh?
TRACEY=>What?
JOHNSON=>I said it's creepy -- the way he keeps staring out like that.
TRACEY=>Creepy.
JOHNSON=>You know you're not supposed to be in here.
TRACEY=>I know. I just thought you'd like some company.
JOHNSON=>Love some. But Rowan would shit kittens.
TRACEY=>I've got brownies.
JOHNSON=>Double-fudge?
TRACEY=>With nuts...just the way you like 'em.
JOHNSON=>Oh no... no way.
TRACEY=>Come on... you promised.
JOHNSON=>Are you kidding? If Rowan finds out we'll both get pink slips.
TRACEY=>Just a couple of quick shots... ...something kinky?
ROWAN=>Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
JOHNSON=>Sorry, doc. We were just goofing around.
ROWAN=>Goofing around. That's exactly what got 167 people killed.
ROWAN=>I'm going to put you on report for this, Johnson.
JOHNSON=>I'm on report. Look, we weren't hurting anything. You've been pumping him full of drugs for two years. The guy's harmless. What can he do?
ROWAN=>You better hope you don't find out. Now get back behind that weapon and keep your eyes on him at all times.
JOHNSON=>Yes, sir. Er, ma'am.
JOHNSON=>Stare at that, you ugly son-of-a bitch.
ROWAN=>What are you doing here?
DR. WIMMER=>What do you think -- I'm taking the specimen.
ROWAN=>But you can't. I haven't prepared the cryostasis chamber yet.
DR. WIMMER=>I don't want him frozen, Doctor. I want him alive.
ROWAN=>We've already discusses this.
DR. WIMMER=>Yes, well, I went over your head. I have the Army's permission to remove the specimen to our Scranton Facility.
ROWAN=>But Dr. Wimmer you can't risk transporting him through open country.
DR. WIMMER=>You have to see the bigger picture here.
ROWAN=>I've seen it, or should I remind you of the last time you tried to move him?
DR. WIMMER=>We've come a long way since then.
ROWAN=>I'm telling you...
DR. WIMMER=>Look, this isn't open for discussion. His unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue, even to defy death simply calls for more research.
ROWAN=>You're willing to risk the deaths of innocent civilians if he escapes.
DR. WIMMER=>No one is truly innocent, besides, I'm sure Sgt. Mazur and his men can handle the transfer. Right, Sgt.?
SGT. MAZUR=>Don't worry, ma'am. He so much as twitches, I'll blow him right into Tomorrow-morrow land.
DR. WIMMER=>Dr. Wimmer, please...
DR. WIMMER=>You've done good work on this project, Rowan, but you are no longer needed here. Sergeant?
SGT. MAZUR=>Let's move him out.
ROWAN=>But...
SGT. MAZUR=>Careful with that 50, soldier. You've got friendlies out here.
DR. WIMMER=>What are you waiting for?
SGT. MAZUR=>Just takin' my time, doc. I only want to have to do this once. All right, boys. Let's knock him out.
SGT. MAZUR=>What the Christ?
DR. WIMMER=>It can't be!
SGT. MAZUR=>Oh, shit.
ROWAN=>Hey, what's the...?
ROWAN=>Oh shit.
SGT. MAZUR=>Get out of here! Get out now!
ROWAN=>What's happened?
SGT. MAZUR=>He's escaped!
ROWAN=>Damnit, Wimmer!
COMPUTER VOICE=>Cryo Unit sealed. Please initiate activation sequence.
COMPUTER VOICE=>Please initial --
COMPUTER VOICE=>Cryo Unit activated.
COMPUTER VOICE=>Cryo Unit Breach. Lock-down in progress.
ROWAN=>No! She places her hands on the Cryo Unit and shoves herself off the machete blade. She screams in pain and staggers toward the closing door.
ROWAN=>No!
ROWAN=>Somebody! No!
ROWAN=>NO! Please!
LOWE=>Everyone stay put...Kay-em.
LOWE=>Amazing. It's still cold.
AZRAEL=>Awesome, this is the real deal, isn't it?
LOWE=>It certainly is. Someone tell me what you make of that?
AZRAEL=>Some kind of storage container.
TSUNARON=>Probably a cryostasis unit. I'd guess an early Port series. Kay-Em?
TSUNARON=>Is anyone thinking what I'm thinking?
LOWE=>Kicker, open it up.
JANESSA=>What the hell is that?
LOWE=>My god, he's a monster. Who can tell me what he's wearing on his face?
JANESSA=>Some kind of 20th century carbon filtration unit?
TSUNARON=>No, it's a hockey mask.
LOWE=>Very good, Tsun.
JANESSA=>What's a hockey mask?
LOWE=>Amazing. Absolute museum quality. We are looking at the find of the century, here.
JANESSA=>Kids?
LOWE=>Azrael, are you paying attention?
AZRAEL=>Not really.
LOWE=>Don't touch anything.
LOWE=>Let's get him back to the ship.
TSUNARON=>Uh, guys...
TSUNARON=>There's a body over here.
LOWE=>Kay-Em?
LOWE=>25 percent?
LOWE=>That's incredible.
JANESSA=>Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're saying we could bring her back to life?
LOWE=>Lou, get ready for dust off. We have a priority evac.
FAT LOU=>Copy that. En route in five.
LOWE=>Not five. NOW!
KICKER=>Look out!
AZRAEL=>Fine?! I'm missing my fucking -- You're so pretty.
LOWE=>In the future, try not to destroy the 400 year old artifacts.
LOWE=>We're gonna make history here, people.
FAT LOU=>Kicker, are the doors secure?
KICKER=>Locked and blocked.
FAT LOU=>Lift off in three, two...
FAT LOU=>What did you find?
KICKER=>You won't believe it. Get the Sarge on the horn.
BRIGGS=>You hear? Division four just entered the occupied zone.
DALLAS=>Casualties?
BRIGGS=>Minimal.
DALLAS=>How the hell did we get this screwed up assignment?
BRIGGS=>Amen, bro. I didn't join the Grunt corp to be a friggin' babysitter.
BRODSKI=>Brodski, here.
KICKER=>We found a viable down here.
BRODSKI=>Say again?
KICKER=>We found two bodies in deep cryo-stasis. The Kay-Em unit thinks we can resuscitate the female. We're on approach now.
BRODSKI=>Roger that. Okay, team. Company's coming. Let's get out the welcome mat.
CONDOR=>Damn, I thought we might get to kill something.
BRODSKI=>Crutch! You copy?
BRODSKI=>Crutch! Do you read?
BRODSKI=>Crutch? Wake the hell up!
CRUTCH=>What do you want?
BRIGGS=>They're on their way back. Prepare docking and power up the labs.
CRUTCH=>Whatever...
BRODSKI=>Kicker, Briggs, take the girl. Condor, Geko, you got the big guy.
LOWE=>We need to get her to the lab.
BRODSKI=>Can you bring her back?
LOWE=>We'll find out, sergeant.
BRODSKI=>You're not bringing him back, are you?
LOWE=>Impossible.
AZRAEL=>Oh shit! I forgot my arm!
JANESSA=>Here, dumbass.
AZRAEL=>Hi, hand.
BRODSKI=>Any idea how long she's been down?
BRODSKI=>This'll be one helluva wake-up call.
JANESSA=>I'm bitchy as hell when I wake up.
TSUNARON=>Did you just wake up?
TSUNARON=>Once we're in the clear I'd like to check your circuits.
JANESSA=>I bet you would.
TSUNARON=>It's not like that.
LOWE=>Where are the others?
KINSA=>Waylander's in Lab One. He's charging the bed now.
LOWE=>Good. Get Stoney and Adrienne into Lab Two. Take the big guy and meet them there. The female goes to Lab One with me.
KINSA=>Oh, you guys always find the cool shit.
AZRAEL=>Oh my God. My arm's not on my body.
LOWE=>Tsunaron get him fixed in the bed now.
TSUNARON=>Got it.
LOWE=>Adrienne, good. I need you in Lab Two.
ADRIENNE=>What's happening? You found something, didn't you?
LOWE=>Two viables.
ADRIENNE=>Two?! My God, in what condition?
LOWE=>Perfect. We're attempting reanimation on one.
ADRIENNE=>This is unbelievable! A walking, talking Earth 1 ancestor. I got a million questions.
LOWE=>Save it for later. Complete a full endothelic structural scan on the large body.
ADRIENNE=>Not a problem.
LOWE=>Take point on this one. Use Kinsa and Stoney. They're second year so lead them through it step by step.
KINSA=>Good deal.
ADRIENNE=>They'll just slow me down.
LOWE=>Just take them through it. Log him in properly and place him in stasis. I'll check back with you.
ADRIENNE=>Right.
AZRAEL=>My arm, it's not on my body, dude.
BRODSKI=>It will be, just give it a few minutes.
TSUNARON=>Lie back, man. Let our beautiful Nanotech 1000 make your arm as good as new.
AZRAEL=>My arm, man, it's not on my body, dude.
TSUNARON=>We gotcha, man. Just lie back and don't move.
WAYLANDER=>How much Etherene did you give him, Kay Em?
LOWE=>Where are we?
WAYLANDER=>Board's all green. The N2's warm and ready, teach.
LOWE=>Good. Kay-Em begin stabilizing any cellular fractures.
LOWE=>Janessa. Give me a full scan. Glycerol levels, cerebral perfusion saturation, the works.
JANESSA=>I live to serve, Professor.
LOWE=>Let's see what we are dealing with.
JANESSA=>Thaw rate has accelerated. Decrystalization of the membranes is now at 32 percent and rising.
LOWE=>Good. Someone get those clothes off her.
WAYLANDER=>I got it.
JANESSA=>I got it.
JANESSA=>Honestly, you'd think you'd never seen a woman before.
WAYLANDER=>Not a 400-year old naked one.
JANESSA=>And the difference would be?
LOWE=>Waylander, where are her diffusion barriers?
WAYLANDER=>Seventeen and stable.
TSUNARON=>Here we go.
TSUNARON=>Az, when I was 12, I fell into a tri baler. Took one of my legs clean off. Look at this, good as new.
AZRAEL=>Great looking leg, man.
BRODSKI=>See, there. That's your arm.
TSUNARON=>Sit still, now. Or you'll have an elbow where a wrist should be.
AZRAEL=>Right. Like I'm gonna interfere with defracturization. It's not like I've never been W.O.A. You know.
WAYLANDER=>Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.
JANESSA=>They can't be real. Kay-Em, check for silicone.
TSUNARON=>She's kidding.
WAYLANDER=>Oh, boy.
JANESSA=>And she's clear.
LOWE=>Okay, what next?
WAYLANDER=>Finish removing the vitrified extracellular solution?
LOWE=>That will happen spontaneously.
TSUNARON=>Introduce metabolic inhibitors into the cytoplasm.
LOWE=>Very good.
JANESSA=>I knew that.
LOWE=>Stay positive, people. This will take a little while. How is he?
BRODSKI=>Just a couple more adjustments.
LOWE=>Good.
BRODSKI=>Son, you're damn near good as new.
AZRAEL=>Hey, who's the grizzle grabber.
TSUNARON=>We brought her back from Earth.
AZRAEL=>Can I have her?
TSUNARON=>Absolutely.
TSUNARON=>Try it out. Go on.
AZRAEL=>All right. Whoa, still a little dizzy.
BRODSKI=>Easy boy. Just take it easy.
AZRAEL=>Yeah, right. Everybody, I'm goin' to the grid. Kay?
ADRIENNE=>Specimen 4420 found in sector 3930L on Earth Prime. Subject discovered in complete cryosuspension. Severe loss in the axoplastic proteins as well as major hemorrhaging in most major organs renders subject invalid.
STONEY=>Where do you want this?
ADRIENNE=>On the Specimen table.
ADRIENNE=>We need to do a full morphological work up on this one. So let's start with a --
KINSA=>Cerebral C-Tep Scan. What? I read the same medfiles you do.
STONEY=>Mmmm. Smart and sexy.
ADRIENNE=>Initiating scan.
ADRIENNE=>Weight 309.7 mercrons.
STONEY=>Big sucker.
KINSA=>I bet he's hung like a mammoth.
ADRIENNE=>There's been massive cerebral diminishment. Even more than would be expected in a --
KINSA=>Sorry. You were saying?
ADRIENNE=>Look, why don't you two take a break.
STONEY=>No, we'll help.
KINSA=>No problem.
ADRIENNE=>I can handle this. Come back in an hour. We'll but him into stasis when you -- when you're more focused.
STONEY=>You mean that?
KINSA=>Thanks, Adrienne.
ADRIENNE=>Don't mention it. Professor. The cerebrum has shrunk so much the proteins make identification of individual nerve fibres impossible.
LOWE=>Amazing. See what you can salvage from the optic cortex, then move on.
ADRIENNE=>My pleasure, professor.
ADRIENNE=>Look at the brain on the male subject.
LOWE=>Amazing.
TSUNARON=>How could he function with a brain that small?
JANESSA=>Way manages.
WAYLANDER=>Very funny.
JANESSA=>Professor!
WAYLANDER=>She's de-animating!
JANESSA=>The lipids in her cytoplasm are separating.
TSUNARON=>GTT is 59 and rising.
LOWE=>Kay-Em. What's her maximum limit transition temperature.
TSUNARON=>We're at 61 and rising...
BRODSKI=>Is this bad?
TSUNARON=>If we don't reattach her lipids before the GTT hits 80 she'll be a 400 year old vegetable.
LOWE=>So what's happening?!
WAYLANDER=>Her psychorophillic levels are still at 45 over 200.
JANESSA=>Q.E.P.'s are green.
TSUNARON=>Metabolic inhibitors are all in. What about cryoprotectant in her lymphatic system.
LOWE=>No. Her potassium levels would be off the scale.
LOWE=>Stay focused. Find it. And find it now!
TSUNARON=>Initiating a Hex2 charge.
TSUNARON=>Again.
WAYLANDER=>Still nothing, professor?
JANESSA=>Lipids still falling.
LOWE=>Damn it!
JANESSA=>I got it!
WAYLANDER=>Glass Transition Temperature 67 and falling. We're in the safe level.
JANESSA=>Basal Core Temp was too low causing a phase separation of lipid.
TSUNARON=>What the hell'd you do?
JANESSA=>Her potassium saturation was causing the hippocampal dendrites to fire early.
LOWE=>Which caused the lipids to lose their cohesion. Good catch, Janessa.
JANESSA=>I had a good teacher.
LOWE=>Good bring her up slow and steady.
TSUNARON=>I had a good teacher.
JANESSA=>Shut up.
LOWE=>Ready phase two. Are we stable?
WAYLANDER=>Stable.
JANESSA=>Stable.
LOWE=>Start cell reconstruction.
TSUNARON=>Initiating res sequence.
WAYLANDER=>Bring on the Ants!
LOWE=>Cross your fingers people.
WAYLANDER=>Tsun, what'a ya got?
JANESSA=>Tsun?!
TSUNARON=>I don't know yet!
TSUNARON=>Cool! It's working!
LOWE=>No shit. I think she broke my nose.
BRODSKI=>I like her already.
LOWE=>Easy, easy.
ROWAN=>Did you get him?
LOWE=>Got who?
ROWAN=>Then he's still out there?!
LOWE=>Shhh, everything's alright. No one's out there. You're safe here.
ROWAN=>Where am I? Last thing I remember there was a leak in the cryo-unit. Is it contained?
LOWE=>It was contained, but when the cryo-unit ruptured, you didn't escape it. It put you into stasis.
ROWAN=>My God. How long?
LOWE=>The year is 2455.
ROWAN=>2455...
LOWE=>I know this is a huge shock, but you're safe with us. We're aboard Grendel, a class IV Catamaran transport ship. We're on our way home. You're going to be just fine.
ROWAN=>2455. Over 400 years.
LOWE=>I brought you something to eat. Not much longer and we'll be at Earth II.
ROWAN=>Earth II? What about Earth?
LOWE=>It's dead. The oceans, the soil. Neither will sustain life. Is there anything I can do for you?
ROWAN=>Super Bowl tickets on the fifty yard line.
LOWE=>I beg your pardon?
ROWAN=>Am I going to be alright?
LOWE=>You should be completely normal. Don't worry. We'll keep an eye on you.
ROWAN=>Why did you bring me back?
LOWE=>Seemed like the right thing to do.
ROWAN=>I'm just confused.
LOWE=>I can imagine.
ROWAN=>How do you thank someone who gives you your life back?
LOWE=>You'll live a long time. We'll figure something out. You want to tell me what happened down there? I take it being stabbed and frozen wasn't part of the plan.
ROWAN=>It's a long story.
LOWE=>I'm a good listener.
ROWAN=>It's classified. If I told you, I'd have to kill you.
LOWE=>Oh dear.
ROWAN=>It's a joke. I'm a Project Leader. I was a Project Leader at Crystal Lake Research. Jason Vorhees was the subject.
LOWE=>Jason Vorhees?
ROWAN=>Notorious murderer. We executed him for the first time in 2008.
LOWE=>The first time?
ROWAN=>Electrocution, gas, firing squad... we even hung him once. Nothing worked. Finally it was decided if we couldn't terminate him, at least we could contain him. Cryogenic stasis. Freeze him until we could figure it out.
LOWE=>Sounds sensible.
ROWAN=>I thought so. But people who were too smart for their own good felt a creature that couldn't be killed was too valuable to be filed away. In the end it always comes down to money.
LOWE=>Secure line. Perez, Dieter, Solaris Research station. Connect.
PEREZ=>Lowe, you bastard. Lowe????
LOWE=>We hit the mother load.
PEREZ=>Do you know what time it is?
LOWE=>We're six parsecs away. How the hell do I know what time it is. We just hit a goldmine.
PEREZ=>A box of DVD's isn't a gold mine. I told you, I can't move 'em.
LOWE=>Just look at the file.
LOWE=>Two 400-year old frozen specimens. One well preserved. And, are you ready for this, one up and walking around.
LOWE=>What? How much?
PEREZ=>Enough to keep us in whisky and hookers til your liver rots and our peckers fall off.
LOWE=>How much?
PEREZ=>A large fortune.
LOWE=>I got him frozen right here on the ship.
PEREZ=>Work up a list of ownership?
LOWE=>No list. He's my find. He's mine.
PEREZ=>What about your students?
LOWE=>They're students. The educational experience is enough.
PEREZ=>Doctor, you're one son of a bitch.
LOWE=>Uh-huh. And soon to be one rich son of a bitch. Lowe out.
JANESSA=>I think we need to talk about my mid term.
ADRIENNE=>Poor baby, I can see why you wore that thing.
ADRIENNE=>Prepare organ vats. Liquid nitrogen mix.
ADRIENNE=>That's it...come to mama...
TSUNARON=>Sure, they're great. I wasn't sure that the polystyrine would bind properly with your outer...
TSUNARON=>Oh, geez. Look like I'll have to double the glucomazine.
TSUNARON=>Yeah, sure.
TSUNARON=>Er...well, you're not really programmed for that kind of stuff, Kay-Em. It might fry your emotional cortex.
TSUNARON=>If past history holds true, you'll end up as psycho and batty as every other girl I've gone to bed with. I would never want to do that to you.
TSUNARON=>Look, Kay-Em. Let's not complicate things. I like our relationship just the way it is.
KINSA=>C'mon, Stoney.
KINSA=>Say it.
STONEY=>Say what?
KINSA=>Say it. Or I'll go back to the lab with Adrienne. You know I will.
STONEY=>Kinsa. I love Kinsa. I want you, Kinsa.
KINSA=>Because...
STONEY=>Because Kinsa is the most beautiful, most sexy girl in the universe. And I want to go down on her.
KINSA=>Okay. That oughta do it.
KINSA=>Bed!
LOWE=>Harder! Harder!
AZRAEL=>I just saved your ass.
DALLAS=>Don't get too cocky.
AZRAEL=>I mean, you must really feel like a wuss.
DALLAS=>Check the score, kid. It's still nine to-three.
AZRAEL=>Yeah, but I'm in the groove now. What do you say? Next kill wins?
DALLAS=>Lock and load, killer.
AZRAEL=>My kill!
DALLAS=>No, Id say that was his kill.
AZRAEL=>What the hell?
DALLAS=>I thought this was an alien sim.
AZRAEL=>It is.
AZRAEL=>Pause play.
AZRAEL=>I said, "Pause play."
DALLAS=>He's not pausing.
AZRAEL=>I'm aware of that.
AZRAEL=>We may need to reboot.
AZRAEL=>That doesn't count as a kill.
DALLAS=>Oh, yes it does.
DALLAS=>Okay, screw this. Game over.
DALLAS=>Drop the kid! I said drop the kid! Now!!
DALLAS=>Azrael, get out of here!
DALLAS=>What are you?! Get out of there! I got no shot!!
JANESSA=>Just admit it. You want me.
TSUNARON=>I could never be with a girl who's balls are hairier than mine.
LOWE=>Guys, our star patient is back. Rowan, this is Tsunaron, Janessa and Waylander.
JANESSA=>Looks like my clothes fit.
ROWAN=>These are yours? Thank you. Wow! What're these?
TSUNARON=>Janessa's love children.
JANESSA=>That wit is the reason you haven't had a real date since I've known you.
LOWE=>And of course, you've already met Sergeant Brodski.
BRODSKI=>Ma'am.
JANESSA=>And Kay-Em 14. Tsunaron's love machine.
TSUNARON=>Would you stop it. Kay-Em's an advanced knowledge Matrix android that I have been programming.
WAYLANDER=>Is that what you call it?
ROWAN=>Amazing. You seem so real.
LOWE=>Well, I thought we might take a look at your friend. Run some tests before we determine the best preservation protocol.
ROWAN=>My friend?
TSUNARON=>Big fella in the mask.
ROWAN=>He's not my friend. He killed everyone then came after me. He's alive? On this ship?!
LOWE=>Our scans reveal he is very dead.
ROWAN=>Then your scans are wrong. You should definitely dump him into space or something.
LOWE=>That would be irresponsible and foolhardy. He is a valuable scientific artifact. And must be carefully preserved. Just like yourself.
ROWAN=>Freezing him just stopped him. It didn't kill him. He's not dead.
LOWE=>Believe me, he's definitely dead.
ROWAN=>Where is he?
JANESSA=>Ohmygod!
BRODSKI=>Everyone back off and don't touch a thing!
LOWE=>What the hell happened here?
ROWAN=>You let the guy thaw, didn't you?
LOWE=>What? Don't be silly.
ROWAN=>I'm telling you, he got up off that slab and he killed her and I guarantee you, he's up walking around right now looking for someone else to kill.
JANESSA=>But he was frozen solid.
ROWAN=>So? So was I.
TSUNARON=>He's frozen and he's dead.
ROWAN=>No he's not. He's Jason Vorhees.
LOWE=>Young lady, I think you're a bit hysterical.
ROWAN=>Do I look hysterical, Professor?
BRODSKI=>I'm putting us on lockdown. Lou, how long till we make Solaris?
FAT LOU=>Forty-seven minutes. Give or take.
LOWE=>I don't believe this.
BRODSKI=>What part of that dead body do you not believe?
LOWE=>That's not what I meant.
BRODSKI=>I know what you meant. Attention.
BRODSKI=>We have a hostile on board.
BRODSKI=>Repeat: hostile on board.
BRODSKI=>Grunt team report to weapons.
BRODSKI=>Everyone else report to Lab One immediately.
KINSA=>Wait a second.
STONEY=>Well, hurry up!
BRODSKI=>You found all your kids yet?
LOWE=>Yes, look. Sergeant Brodski, what are your plans?
KICKER=>Sarge, Grunt team's assembled. Dallas is a no show.
LOWE=>Sergeant...
BRODSKI=>Where the hell is he?!
KICKER=>Dunno, Sarge.
TSUNARON=>I think he and Az are in Bay Two. Playing one of my game sims.
LOWE=>Sergeant! I think we should talk.
KINSA=>St...Stoney's dead.
BRODSKI=>Kicker, I want full tac and armor. Two minutes. Whoever this guy is, I don't want anything left of him by the time we reach Solaris!
KICKER=>Roger that!
LOWE=>Whoa, don't want anything left of him?! What are you talking about?
BRODSKI=>Everyone get to Lab One and stay there until you hear from me.
LOWE=>Sergeant Brodski.
BRODSKI=>Don't leave those kids alone. What the hell's the matter with you?
LOWE=>We're less than an hour from Solaris. They have seven fully equipped tactical units completely capable of handling this. I say we wait and sedate him.
BRODSKI=>I'm taking this guy out.
LOWE=>Sergeant! I need him alive!
BRODSKI=>No, you want him alive what you need is to get out of my face!
LOWE=>Look, Sergeant. There are other considerations. Financial... considerations.
BRODSKI=>My only consideration is the safety of the people on this ship.
LOWE=>All right! A hundred thousand.
LOWE=>Two hundred.
LOWE=>Five!
BRODSKI=>Five?
BRODSKI=>Kicker, Briggs, you'll head to Bay Two. Find Dallas. Sven, Geko, you got Starboard pontoon. Condor with me. I want full armor, BFG's and Rail-capable blasters.
GEKO=>Hell yeah!
SVEN=>So, Sarge, we got permission to download some whoop ass on this guy?
BRODSKI=>I promised the doc we'd take him alive. So after you've blown him to hell, put on in his knee so we can say we tried.
KICKER=>Sarge, we've got a body in Bay Two.
BRODSKI=>Dead?
KICKER=>Roger that. I think it's the Azrael kid.
BRIGGS=>Oh Lord.
BRODSKI=>Sarge, I found Dallas. He's dead.
SVEN=>Sarge, we got a blood trail leading toward the Cargo Bay.
BRODSKI=>Condor, Kicker and I will take Cargo main, rest of you take portside. Stay alert. We want some definite payback on his ass. Breech on my command.
KICKER=>Roger that. Time to kill something.
BRIGGS=>Sorry!
KICKER=>Don't do that!
BRIGGS=>Dude, you sort of scream like a girl.
KICKER=>Screw you.
BRIGGS=>You wish.
CRUTCH=>What the hell is going on?
BRODSKI=>Crutch, out, now?!
BRODSKI=>Briggs, anything?
BRIGGS=>Negative.
ROWAN=>This isn't gonna work.
LOWE=>I've got everything under control.
BRODSKI=>Condor? Anything topside?
CONDOR=>Nothing yet, Sarge.
ROWAN=>Jesus, I need a cigarette.
JANESSA=>I thought those caused cancer.
ROWAN=>What, you guys can't cure cancer?
TSUNARON=>Of course we can.
ROWAN=>Then somebody get me a fucking cigarette.
BRIGGS=>He was...he was right here!
BRODSKI=>Target is gone. Repeat. Target is gone.
KICKER=>Where's Sven?
BRIGGS=>That was Condor.
BRODSKI=>Condor, report! Sven, report! Condor, report. Repeat, Condor, report!
KICKER=>Sarge, we've found Condor.
BRODSKI=>What's his condition?
GEKO=>He's screwed.
GEKO=>Let's smoke this fucker.
KICKER=>I got him! I got him!!
WAYLANDER=>Yes!
WAYLANDER=>See, they got him.
BRODSKI=>Hang tight. We're on our way.
KICKER=>Take your time. He ain't goin' nowhere.
BRIGGS=>Kicker! Where are you?!
KICKER=>Get out of here.
ROWAN=>Jesus! Get them out of there.
LOWE=>They know what they're doing.
BRIGGS=>No, no no no...
BRODSKI=>Briggs, Kicker, damnit! Report! Where are you!?
BRODSKI=>Oh God, Briggs...
ROWAN=>He's all alone in there.
BRODSKI=>That's how you want it, huh?
BRODSKI=>Come and gitcha some.
BRODSKI=>Now you're officially pissing me off.
BRODSKI=>Man, it's gonna take more than a little poke in the ribs to bring this ol' dog down.
BRODSKI=>Yup, that oughta do it.
LOWE=>Such a waste. I told him, stay calm. Wait until we reach Solaris. Then get your revenge. But don't go up against that killing machine shorthand. Brodski was too proud.
CRUTCH=>Who locked the door?!
CRUTCH=>Somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on?
TSUNARON=>Grunts are dead.
CRUTCH=>Which ones?
TSUNARON=>All of them.
LOWE=>How much longer before Solaris?
FAT LOU=>I'm about to bring us out of hyperdrive now.
CRUTCH=>He's trapped in the cargo bay. We're locked in here. We're safe.
KINSA=>Will they be able to kill him?
LOWE=>Absolutely. Relax, people. I've been in constant contact with Solaris. They have 60 highly trained professionals standing by to get us off.
WAYLANDER=>No offense, Doc. But when we get there I think I'm gonna drop your class.
FAT LOU=>Damn kids. Goddamn field trips. Got me working on a Friday. Bringing psychos on my ship. Be damned if I'm gonna clean up the mess.
VOICE=>Solaris to Grendel. We have you on approach. Standby for docking number.
FAT LOU=>Grendel to Solaris. We need medical and military at the gate. We've got a gib goddamn problem here!
VOICE=>What kind of problem, Grendel?
VOICE=>Repeat, what kind of problem?
FAT LOU=>I'm dead.
VOICE=>Solaris to Grendel, decrease approach speed. Over. Grendel, you're coming in too hot. Pull off!
WAYLANDER=>What now?
WAYLANDER=>Look out!
TSUNARON=>Everyone okay?
JANESSA=>What the hell happened?
ROWAN=>I know I don't have a handle on this whole future thing. But my guess is that wasn't a smooth landing.
WAYLANDER=>Oh my God. It's... Solaris is gone!
KINSA=>Gone?! It can't be gone?!
WAYLANDER=>Look for yourself, it's gone.
KINSA=>It can't be gone. Where are we gonna go? What are we going to do?!
LOWE=>I can't think with you screaming! Lou, what sort of damage are we looking at?! Lou! Lou?!
ROWAN=>Something wrong with the mic?
TSUNARON=>You think he could've gotten to the bridge?
TSUNARON=>I'm sending out a distress beacon.
JANESSA=>We've lost our entire port pontoon, guys.
KINSA=>Please, can't somebody do something?
ROWAN=>They're trying, honey.
CRUTCH=>Our internal pressure's holding, but the main thrusters are off line.
LOWE=>Life support?
CRUTCH=>I can't guarantee anything but she should limp along for now. If I could get to the engine core, I might be able to...
KINSA=>But he's out there!
LOWE=>Let's keep our priorities straight here, people. We're in high traffic lanes. There'll be another ship, I'm sure of it. At least we're safe here.
KINSA=>Ohmygod!!!!
LOWE=>Shut up!!!
WAYLANDER=>Maybe he gave up.
JANESSA=>Yeah, right.
ROWAN=>I don't think he's out there.
JANESSA=>Why don't you poke your head out and see?
TSUNARON=>Kay-Em, come on!
WAYLANDER=>What a time to be big-boned.
LOWE=>Look, look, look, have you considered how valuable you are? Fame, money... with my help, you can have it all.
LOWE=>I have the connections. You name it, I can get it for you. Together we can make a fortune.
LOWE=>You want the machete? Shit, take it. It's yours. Just remember who saved it for you.
LOWE=>It's okay! He just wanted his machete! You're not going to regret this.
KINSA=>Where's professor Lowe?
ROWAN=>I think he's in the lab still.
JANESSA=>What do we do now?
KINSA=>I think I'll go to my room now. Stoney's going to meet me there.
ROWAN=>How do we get off this ship?
WAYLANDER=>I don't know, you tell me.
ROWAN=>How the hell do I know? Can't you beam us off or something?
WAYLANDER=>"Beam" us off?
TSUNARON=>The shuttle.
WAYLANDER=>Hell yeah, the shuttle. Crutch?
CRUTCH=>I can do prelaunch from the bridge. Tsun, you'd have to rework the navigational module. It's only set up for short hauls.
JANESSA=>The rest of us will go to the shuttle. Start the checkoff and get some provisions. Call when you're ready to reroute the fuel.
CRUTCH=>Watch your backs, guys.
ROWAN=>Thanks.
ROWAN=>How long will it take?
TSUNARON=>Not long, I hope.
JANESSA=>Let's hit it guys.
TSUNARON=>You know how to use that?
ROWAN=>Like ridin' a bike. Once you do it, you never forget how.
TSUNARON=>Good. Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold. Meet you at the shuttle bay.
JANESSA=>What's a bike?
CRUTCH=>Poor bastard.
WAYLANDER=>Jesus. That's twisted.
CRUTCH=>Course. I seen worse.
CRUTCH=>Come here.
WAYLANDER=>What?
WAYLANDER=>Bastard.
CRUTCH=>You're lucky you weren't alive during the Microsoft conflict. Hell, we were fighting each other with our own severed limbs.
WAYLANDER=>That's...nice.
ROWAN=>Quiet.
KINSA=>It's him, isn't it? Isn't it?
ROWAN=>Quiet.
KINSA=>But if it's him...
ROWAN=>Make another sound and I'll snap your neck. Got it?
JANESSA=>You're good with people.
ROWAN=>My God, I think there's somebody over there.
JANESSA=>I didn't see anything. We don't have much time.
ROWAN=>Which way is the shuttle?
JANESSA=>Straight across.
ROWAN=>Go. I'll catch up.
JANESSA=>Be careful.
BRODSKI=>Hi.
ROWAN=>Hi. I better get you outta here. They're refitting the shuttle.
ROWAN=>I'm sorry. You're too heavy. I'll have to go get help.
BRODSKI=>Save yourselves. Get the hell out.
ROWAN=>I'm not leaving you. I'll get help and come back.
JANESSA=>C'mon, girl. We're going home.
JANESSA=>You gonna do this thing?
KINSA=>Absolutely.
JANESSA=>Good. Let's get started.
JANESSA=>Kinsa, you there?
KINSA=>Yes, ma'am.
JANESSA=>Crutch?
CRUTCH=>I'm working here, lady.
JANESSA=>Gotcha. Hydraulic lifters?
KINSA=>Pressurized and dampened.
JANESSA=>Avionics?
KINSA=>Set.
JANESSA=>Mixture?
KINSA=>Set. Four points over norm.
JANESSA=>Dorsal sensor indicator?
KINSA=>Nodes not functioning.
JANESSA=>I'll over-ride. How's that?
KINSA=>Dorsal sensor array is engaged. Nodes in flight position.
JANESSA=>Good. Lateral spectrum?
KINSA=>Controls are free and correct.
CRUTCH=>Stand by for the Fuel Transfer, cells six and seven bypass.
JANESSA=>Negative, Crutch. I'm not showing isolinear integrity.
CRUTCH=>Repeat, please.
JANESSA=>No insolinear integrity. I think we may be screwed here.
CRUTCH=>Re route through Lem-Pac Fusion Bypass.
JANESSA=>Say again? Confirm Lem-Pac Fusion.
CRUTCH=>That's affirmative. Lem-Pac Fusion.
KINSA=>Lem-Pac Fusion Bypassed. Standing by.
TSUNARON=>There's enough firepower here to level a moon. Grab what you can and let's head back to the shuttle.
TSUNARON=>So, what do you think? You think we're going to make it?
TSUNARON=>Can't you do a little better on those odds?
TSUNARON=>Forget logic, what does your gut tell you?
TSUNARON=>In case things go bad out there, I just wanted you to know how much I care about you.
TSUNARON=>Whoa.
TSUNARON=>Wow, one kiss jumped us 40 percent?
JANESSA=>Damnit Crutch, you better know what you're doing.
JANESSA=>Yes, Crutch, you did it! You did it!!
KINSA=>Transfer underway.
JANESSA=>Master conduit is free of obstructions. We are fueling.
ROWAN=>Brodski. It was Brodski. He's alive.
JANESSA=>No shit!
ROWAN=>I can't move him. Are Way and Crutch back?
JANESSA=>Still on the bridge, rerouting the fuel. They pulled it off...
ROWAN=>I need help.
JANESSA=>Yo, guys.
ROWAN=>Show me...
JANESSA=>Just hold this down.
ROWAN=>Brodski. He's still alive in the Cargo Bay. I can't move him by myself.
CRUTCH=>I can handle it from here.
WAYLANDER=>On my way.
ROWAN=>Do we have any kind of stretcher?
JANESSA=>Check by the first aid. There. I'll send Way. Crutch, how we doing on time?
CRUTCH=>Time we ain't got, lady. But with my incredible skills...
JANESSA=>And a shitload of good luck.
CRUTCH=>And a giant shitload of good luck. We will be out of here. Shuttle is fueled and ready.
CRUTCH=>Oh, shit. I've got company, people.
WAYLANDER=>Rowan.
ROWAN=>Here.
WAYLANDER=>Where is he?
ROWAN=>Don't know.
WAYLANDER=>This way. Hurry.
CRUTCH=>Fuck me.
JANESSA=>Kinsa! Open the door! Open the fucking door!
WAYLANDER=>What's going on? Why aren't you on board?
JANESSA=>Kinsa won't open the door. Offhand, I'd say she's having a freak-out. And this is really a bad time for this!
ROWAN=>Janessa. Gentle. Kinsa, honey, can you hear me? I need you to open the door.
KINSA=>No...
ROWAN=>Kinsa, we can go home now, it's over. Just open the door.
KINSA=>No.
ROWAN=>Open the fucking door right fucking now you dumb bitch!!!
JANESSA=>That was gentle?
JANESSA=>NO! Kinsa, the fuel lines are still attached!
JANESSA=>Kinsa!
WAYLANDER=>Now what?
JANESSA=>Now what? Basically, now is when we die.
ROWAN=>Bullshit.
JANESSA=>Great. Okay, new plan. When he gets you, I'll run.
TSUNARON=>Hey, slappy! Got a little something for ya!
WAYLANDER=>Uh, wow.
TSUNARON=>I gave her an upload.
JANESSA=>Give me one.
TSUNARON=>Kay-Em!!!
JANESSA=>That didn't go so well.
TSUNARON=>That's my girl.
ROWAN=>Brodski!
BRODSKI=>My pleasure.
JANESSA=>You did it!
WAYLANDER=>All right!
ROWAN=>I was coming back for you.
WAYLANDER=>Let's get you patched up.
ROWAN=>What the hell's that?
TSUNARON=>Nothing good.
TSUNARON=>Can you walk?
BRODSKI=>Better 'n' ever, kid.
WAYLANDER=>We've got trouble.
WAYLANDER=>The collision compromised the hull. She's bleeding out.
JANESSA=>Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit!
RESCUE VOICE=>Tiamat to Grendel, Tiamat to Grendel, do you read? Over. Tiamat to Grendel. Do you read?
JANESSA=>Yes, yes. Thank God! This is Grendel. Tiamat, we read you! Can you hear us?!
RESCUE VOICE=>That's affirmative, Tiamat. Very affirmative. Please advise us of earliest possible ETA. Situation critical.
RESCUE VOICE=>ETA 97 minutes.
WAYLANDER=>We don't have that much time. This is Grendel. Our hull is bleeding out. We're gonna have a core implosion in less than thirty minutes. Do you copy?
RESCUE VOICE=>We copy you, Grendel. Advise how you would like us to proceed?
JANESSA=>You've got to come now. Do you copy? Now.
RESCUE VOICE=>We're four parsecs away, Grendel.
WAYLANDER=>I don't want to take them down with us. If you can't get here in half an hour, there's no point.
JANESSA=>What?! Are you fucking high?! Tiamat, this is Grendel! Ignore the last idiot! You get your ass out here, you hear me! Get your ass out here!
ROWAN=>Would it help if we just go over here?
TSUNARON=>No good. When this hull blows, it'll take the bridge with it.
ROWAN=>Unless we disconnect these walkways.
WAYLANDER=>You can't disconnect them.
BRODSKI=>Blow them up?
ROWAN=>Don't know.
TSUNARON=>Plenty of macrocharge in the weapons hold.
BRODSKI=>This...this could work.
WAYLANDER=>Tiamat, we're gonna try something here. If you're game, maintain your current course and speed and, God willing, we'll see you when you get here.
RESCUE VOICE=>Roger that. See you in 95 minutes. Good luck, Grendel.
BRODSKI=>Let's move out.
BRODSKI=>We'll split up and set the charges. Who has the remote?
WAYLANDER=>Right here, baby.
BRODSKI=>We'll meet back in Walkway B.
BRODSKI=>Okay, I've got two more that I want to put near the core. Tell Waylander to wait for me outside the hold. I'll be another three, four minutes.
ROWAN=>Got it. You sure you don't need me here?
BRODSKI=>No, just tell Waylander. He's got the detonator.
JANESSA=>All set?
TSUNARON=>Good to go.
TSUNARON=>Hold together, baby.
JANESSA=>What the hell is that?
WAYLANDER=>Impossible! He's dead.
ROWAN=>I'd say he got better.
JANESSA=>Ya think?
TSUNARON=>Can you take him?
BRODSKI=>I'm set. On my way back.
ROWAN=>Better hurry.
BRODSKI=>What the hell's going on?
ROWAN=>Jason Fucking Vorhees, that's what!
BRODSKI=>Now way!
TSUNARON=>Kay-Em!!!
TSUNARON=>Rowan, what are you doing?
TSUNARON=>Waylander!
ROWAN=>Run! Run!
JANESSA=>There...
JANESSA=>Oh shit! Waylander had the trigger!
TSUNARON=>Get ready to blow the walkway!
BRODSKI=>Waylander's got the trigger.
WAYLANDER=>Hey, asshole!
BRODSKI=>Hit the deck!
BRODSKI=>Damage?
TSUNARON=>We're okay. I think we're okay.
ROWAN=>We made it?
BRODSKI=>Maybe.
RESCUE VOICE=>Tiamat to Grendel. Come in.
JANESSA=>We read you, Tiamat. Our little plan worked.
RESCUE VOICE=>What the hell is going on in there? You almost took us out.
JANESSA=>Where are you, Tiamat?
RESCUE PILOT=>Right next door. We have you vectored for approach and emergency docking. You're doing a little rocking and rolling out there. So do what you can to hold your position.
JANESSA=>Like we've got a choice?
BRODSKI=>Understood, Tiamat. Standing by. Let's head to docking. You okay, girl?
ROWAN=>Never better.
BRODSKI=>Let's go.
JANESSA=>It's about damn time!
BRODSKI=>You've got to be shitting me!
BRODSKI=>Come on!
BRODSKI=>JANESSA!
JANESSA=>SHUT THE DAMN DOOR!
ROWAN=>Here!
JANESSA=>This sucks on so many levels!
ROWAN=>Oh, great!
BRODSKI=>Tiamat, we are at the evac door.
RESCUE PILOT=>So am I, Grendel. You ready to get off that boat?
ROWAN=>We are so ready.
BRODSKI=>That's affirmative, Tiamat! Standing by for acquisition.
RESCUE PILOT=>Tiamat to Grendel, lifeline secured. Initiate collar pressurization.
BRODSKI=>Roger, Tiamat! Opening under doors.
ROWAN=>Lemme guess, we just got another visit from the fuck-up fairy.
TSUNARON=>I've got this. Let me try an override. Shit shit shit shit shit shit. The exterior motor's got no power.
BRODSKI=>Yeah.
ROWAN=>What does that mean?
BRODSKI=>It means I'm going EVA. I can get it from outside.
TSUNARON=>Yeah.
ROWAN=>What does that mean?
BRODSKI=>It means I'm going EVA. I can get it from outside.
TSUNARON=>I don't think we have time.
BRODSKI=>We don't have a choice. I'll need you here on this side.
ROWAN=>EVA. What's EVA?
BRODSKI=>Spacewalk.
ROWAN=>Oh yeah, spacewalk.
TSUNARON=>It's worth a shot. Go.
TSUNARON=>If he can jump the leads out there we can reroute them in here. Hopefully, that will open the door and we get off this thing before it blows the hell up.
ROWAN=>Sounds like a good plan.
TSUNARON=>Tiamat? This is Grendel. Our escape hatch's jammed. We're going EVA to try to patch it up.
RESCUE PILOT=>Then get a move on. Systems show you are leaking serious nitro-methane. It's already at 41 percent. You get off now or you don't get off.
TSUNARON=>We're on it, Tiamat. Just a few more minutes.
BRODSKI=>Set. I'm in the Maintenance Hatch. Check 1, 2, 3.
ROWAN=>It's working.
BRODSKI=>I'm ready.
TSUNARON=>Then go, Sarge.
ROWAN=>Sarge...
BRODSKI=>Yeah.
ROWAN=>Don't fuck this up.
TSUNARON=>Those hatches aren't going to keep him out much longer. You were an expert on this guy, right?
ROWAN=>What are you thinking?
TSUNARON=>Tell me everything you know about Crystal Lake.
BRODSKI=>I'm out here, let's do this.
ROWAN=>Standing by. Over.
BRODSKI=>Okay, I'm going to bypass the main power supply unit and send it to you.
ROWAN=>Send it? How will I know I got it?
BRODSKI=>Just listen. There's a red wire next to a red and blue striped conducer. Disconnect it and hold it free. Don't touch anything.
ROWAN=>Got it.
BRODSKI=>When I tell yo, attach it to the terminal on the lower left corner. See it. It has two yellow leads coming in.
ROWAN=>I see them.
BRODSKI=>Connect them and don't do anything else. Until I tell you.
RESCUE PILOT=>That was another part of your hull, Grendel. You are running out of time.
BRODSKI=>Just a few more minutes, Tiamat.
TSUNARON=>We're working very hard and very fast, right guys?!
RESCUE PILOT=>We can disengage and come around again.
TSUNARON=>No way, Tiamat. Just another minute.
RESCUE PILOT=>We'll stand by as long as we can, Grendel.
TSUNARON=>Uh-oh.
TSUNARON=>He's here. You ready, Kay?
TSUNARON=>Initiate.
TSUNARON=>It's working. It's working, he's buying it! Repair variations using data file Crystal Lake circa 1980.
ROWAN=>Wow.
BRODSKI=>Rowan. Are you there?
ROWAN=>Yes.
BRODSKI=>Now! See the bright blue diode? Connect it to the terminal.
TSUNARON=>Was that you or me?
BRODSKI=>That's the wrong one!
ROWAN=>Shut up! I did what you said!
BRODSKI=>The bright blue diode?!
ROWAN=>Okay, it was just blue. I've got it now. Sorry.
TSUNARON=>Ooops.
ROWAN=>What do you mean, "oops"?
TSUNARON=>Nothing. How's it coming with that door?
ROWAN=>Not nothing. You don't just say oops. What?
TSUNARON=>I think he saw me.
ROWAN=>If you got something brilliant up your sleeve, do it now!
TSUNARON=>I got something. Kay? Where are you?
TSUNARON=>Initiate.
ROWAN=>That's brilliant!
TSUNARON=>Thank you, thank you.
TSUNARON=>Now why don't you get that door open? Do something?
ROWAN=>You do something! We're busy here!
BRODSKI=>Okay, Rowan! Try it now!
ROWAN=>Here we go!
ROWAN=>Didn't work.
BRODSKI=>Okay. I'll try the other. Stand by.
TSUNARON=>He's done with the campers.
TSUNARON=>Too good. He's coming back.
ROWAN=>We need something, Tsunaron.
TSUNARON=>I know...ummmm...
ROWAN=>Anything!
TSUNARON=>Okay! Here!
ROWAN=>That's the beset you could come up with?
BRODSKI=>Okay! Try it again!
TSUNARON=>It's engaged, man. The door is engaged.
RESCUE PILOT=>We have lock, Grendel. We have lock.
TSUNARON=>Brodski, you're a GOD!
ROWAN=>We gonna see you some time soon?
BRODSKI=>I'm on my way.
RESCUE PILOT=>Come on, Grendel! We gotta go now!
BRODSKI=>Rowan, you and Tsunaron get on that ship. If you have to leave, leave! Don't wait for me.
ROWAN=>No.
BRODSKI=>Tsunaron, make sure she gets on that ship.
TSUNARON=>I hear you, Sarge.
ROWAN=>Hey, Slappy. Yeah you! I owe you big time and now it's time for payback. You wanna piece of me, c'mon!
ROWAN=>C'mon. Over here. You know how old I am? Four-hundred eighty one! When I woke up I was confused. Why was I here? What was I supposed to do at my age? Now I know. To put your ass down once and for all, you menace to society!
ROWAN=>Do you wanna have sex? Sex with me? C'mon, can you handle it? Please, please, please. I need it. I want it. Plllleeeeaaase.
ROWAN=>Brodski? Where are you?
BRODSKI=>I'm almost at the hatch.
ROWAN=>I don't know how much longer this is going to work.
ROWAN=>Oh no, I forgot. You only do children, little boys. You couldn't get it up on a bet, you pencil dick faggot. Fuck you!
RESCUE PILOT=>Grendel. We can't keep pressure lock. We will disengage in ninety-seconds.
TSUNARON=>Ninety-seconds? Copy. You hear that, Brodski?
RESCUE PILOT=>Time to cut your losses, Grendel.
ROWAN=>Your mother sucks eggs!
ROWAN=>Goddamn! That's intense.
TSUNARON=>Menace to society!? Who writes your stuff?
RESCUE PILOT=>You have 40-seconds, Grendel.
ROWAN=>Brodski. Come in. Brodski. Where the hell are you?
RESCUE PILOT=>30-seconds.
TSUNARON=>Kay-Em. Please. Kay-Em.
ROWAN=>Brodski! Brodski!
RESCUE PILOT=>15...14...13...
BRODSKI=>You're mine, Slappy!
RESCUE PILOT=>11...10...9...
RESCUE PILOT=>5...4...3...
ROWAN=>No! Wait! Please!!!
RESCUE PILOT=>2...1...
RESCUE PILOT=>Clear! Clear! Clear! Disconnect!
TSUNARON=>Look out!
ROWAN=>You gotta be kidding me.
ROWAN=>Brodski!
BRODSKI=>How about some of this, you mask-wearing machete-wielding sumbitch!
TSUNARON=>He's gone.
ROWAN=>I can't believe it.
TSUNARON=>Kay-Em! You okay?
TSUNARON=>I'll get right on it.
TSUNARON=>Yes?
ROWAN=>It's beautiful. You think I'll fit in?
TSUNARON=>I know you'll fit in. If you want you can crash on my couch for a week or two. Until you find a place of your own.
ROWAN=>Uh, thanks, Tsun.
TSUNARON=>I want to introduce you to my brother.
ROWAN=>He anything like you?
TSUNARON=>Not really.
ROWAN=>He sounds nice.
DAD=>Sure, why not? What harm could it do?
