ARCHER=>May. Mrs. Welland. Good evening.
MRS. WELLAND=>Newland. You know my niece Countess Olenska.
ARCHER=>I hope you've told Madame Olenska.
ARCHER=>That we're engaged. I want everybody to know. Let me announce it this evening atthe ball.
MAY=>If you can persuade Mamma. But why should we change what is already settled?
MAY=>But you can tell my cousin yourself. She remembers you.
ELLEN=>I see everybody the same way, dressed in knickerbockers and pantalettes.
ELLEN=>You were horrid. You kissed me once behind a door. But it was your cousin Vandy,the one who never looked at me, I was in love with.
ARCHER=>Yes, you have been away a very long time.
ELLEN=>Oh, centuries and centuries. So long I'm sure I'm dead and buried, and this dearold place is heaven.
NARRATOR=>It invariably happened, as everything happened in those days, in the same way. Asusual, Mrs. Julius Beaufort appeared just before the Jewel Song and, again as usual,rose at the end of the third act and disappeared. New York then knew that, ahalf-hour later, her annual opera ball would begin.
NARRATOR=>Carriages waited at the curb for the entire performance. It was widely known in NewYork, but never acknowledged, that Americans want to get away from amusement evenmore quickly than they want to get to it.
NARRATOR=>The Beauforts' house was one of the few in New York that possessed a ballroom. Sucha room, shuttered in darkness three hundred and sixty-four days of the year, wasfelt to compensate for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past. ReginaBeaufort came from an old South Carolina family, but her husband Julius, who passedfor an Englishman, was known to have dissipated habits, a bitter tongue andmysterious antecedents. His marriage assured him a social position, but notnecessarily respect.
NARRATOR=>The house had been boldly planned. Instead of squeezing through a narrow passage toget to the ballroom one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed drawing roomsseeing from afar the many-candled lusters reflected in the polished parquetry andbeyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and tree ferns arched theircostly foliage over seats of black and gold bamboo. But only by actually passingthrough the crimson drawing room could one see "Return of Spring," themuch-discussed nude by Bougeureau, which Beaufort had had the audacity to hang inplain sight. Archer had not gone back to his club after the Opera, as young menusually did, but had walked for some distance up Fifth Avenue before turning back inthe direction of the Beauforts'. He was definitely afraid that the family might begoing too far and would bring the Countess Olenska. He was more than everdetermined to "see the thing through," but he felt less chivalrously inclined todefend the Countess after their brief talk at the opera.
NARRATOR=>On the whole, Lawrence Lefferts was the foremost authority on "form" in New York. On the question of pumps versus patent- leather Oxfords, his authority had never beendisputed.
NARRATOR=>Old Mr. Sillerton Jackson was as great an authority on "family" as Lawrence Leffertswas on "form. "In addition to a forest of family trees, he carried a register ofthe scandals and mysteries that had smouldered under the unruffled surface ofsociety for the past fifty years.
NARRATOR=>Julius Beaufort had speedily made a name for himself in the world of affairs. Hissecret, all were agreed, was the way he carried things off. His social obligationsand the rumors that perpetually swirled around him, all were borne easily beforehim.
MAY=>You see, I told all my friends. Just as you asked.
ARCHER=>Yes, I couldn't wait. Only wish it hadn't had to be at a ball.
MAY=>Yes, I know. But after all, even here we're alone together aren't we?
ARCHER=>Always. The worst of it is. . .
ARCHER=>. . . that I want to kiss you and I can't.
MAY=>Did you tell Ellen, as I asked you?
ARCHER=>No. I didn't have the chance after all.
MAY=>She's my cousin, if others know before she does. . . It's just that she's been away forso long that she's rather sensitive.
ARCHER=>Of course I'll tell her, dearest. But I haven't seen her yet.
MAY=>She decided not to come at the last minute.
ARCHER=>At the last minute?
MAY=>She was afraid her dress wasn't smart enough. We all thought it was so lovely, butshe asked my aunt to take her home.
ARCHER=>Oh well.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Very handsome. Very liberal. In my time a cameo set in pearls was thought to besufficient.
MRS. WELLAND=>It's the new setting. Of course it shows the stone beautifully, but it looks bareold-fashioned eyes.
MRS. MINGOTT=>I hope you don't mean mine, my dear. I like all the novelties. But it's the handthat sets off the ring, isn't it, my dear Mr. Archer? My hands were modeled inParis by the great Rochee. He should do May's.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Her hand is tempered. It's these modern sports that spread the joints. But theskin is white.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Know each other? Everybody in New York has always known everybody. Don't wait tillthe bubble's off the wine. Marry them before Lent. I may catch pneumonia anywinter now, and I want to give the wedding breakfast.
NARRATOR=>Mrs. Manson Mingott was, of course, the first to receive the required betrothalvisit. Much of New York was already related to her, and she knew the remainder bymarriage or by reputation. Though brownstone was the norm, she lived magisteriallywithin a large house of controversial pale cream-colored stone, in an inaccessiblewilderness near the Central Park.
NARRATOR=>The burden of her flesh had long since made it impossible for her to go up and downstairs. So with characteristic independence she had established herself on theground floor of her house. From her sitting room, there was an unexpected vista ofher bedroom.
NARRATOR=>Her visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this arrangement,which recalled scenes in French fiction. This was how women with lovers lived inthe wicked old societies. But if Mrs. Mingott had wanted a lover, the intrepidwoman would have had him too.
NARRATOR=>But she was content, at this moment in her life, simply to sit in a window of hersitting room, waiting calmly for life and fashion to flow northward to her solitarydoors, for her patience was equalled by her confidence.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Beaufort!This is a rare favor.
BEAUFORT=>Unnecessarily rare, I'd say. But I met Countess Ellen in Madison Square, and shewas good enough to let me walk home with her.
MRS. MINGOTT=>This house will be merrier now that she's here. Push up that tuffet. I want a goodgossip.
ELLEN=>Of course I know. And I'm so glad. One doesn't tell such news first in a crowd.
ELLEN=>Good-bye. Come and see me some day.
MRS. WELLAND=>It's a mistake for Ellen to be seen parading up Fifth Avenue with Julius Beaufort atthe crowded hour. The very day after her arrival.
NARRATOR=>Mrs. Archer and her daughter Janey were both shy women and shrank from society. Butthey liked to be well informed of its doings.
MRS. ARCHER=>Oh, necessarily. Beaufort is a vulgar man.
ARCHER=>Nevertheless, no business nuances escape him. Most of New York trusts him with itsaffairs.
MRS. ARCHER=>My grandfather Newland always used to say to mother, "Don't let that fellow Beaufortbe introduced to girls. "But at least he's had the advantage of associating withgentlemen. Even in England, they say. It's all very mysterious.
NARRATOR=>As far back as anyone could remember, New York had been divided into two great clans. Among the Mingotts you could dine on canvasback duck, terrapin and vintage wines. At the Archers, you could talk about Alpine scenery and "The Marble Faun" but receive tepid Veuve Cliquot without a year and warmed-up croquettes from Philadelphia.
JANEY=>And the Countess Olenska. . . was she at the ball too?
MRS. ARCHER=>I appreciate the Mingotts wanting to support her, and have her at the opera. Iadmire their esprit de corps. But why my son's engagement should be mixed up withthat woman's comings and goings I don't see.
JACKSON=>Well, in any case, she was not at the ball.
MRS. ARCHER=>At least she had that decency.
JANEY=>I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon. The dress she woreto the opera was so plain and flat. . .
MRS. ARCHER=>Yes, I'm sure it was in better taste not to go to the ball.
ARCHER=>I don't think it was a question of taste, mother. May said the countess decided herdress wasn't smart enough.
MRS. ARCHER=>Poor Ellen. We must always remember what an eccentric bringing-up Medora Mansongave her. What can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at hercoming-out ball?
JANEY=>It's odd she should have kept such an ugly name as Ellen when she married the Count. I should have changed it to Elaine.
ARCHER=>Why?
JANEY=>I don't know. It sounds more. . . Polish.
MRS. ARCHER=>It certainly sounds more conspicuous. And that can hardly be what she wishes.
ARCHER=>Why not? Why shouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses? She made an awfulmarriage, but should she hide her head as if it were her fault? Should she goslinking around as if she'd disgraced herself? She's had an unhappy life, but thatdoesn't make her an outcast.
JACKSON=>I'm sure that's the line the Mingotts mean to take.
ARCHER=>I don't have to wait for their cue, if that's what you mean, sir.
MRS. ARCHER=>I'm told she's looking for a house. She means to live here.
JANEY=>I hear she means to get a divorce.
ARCHER=>I hope she will.
JACKSON=>There are the rumors, too.
ARCHER=>I've heard them. About the secretary?
JACKSON=>He helped her get away from the husband. They say the Count kept her practically aprisoner. Certainly, the Count had his own way of life.
ARCHER=>You knew him?
JACKSON=>I heard of him at Nice. Handsome, they say, but eyes with a lot of lashes. When hewasn't with women he was collecting china. Paying any price for both, I understand.
ARCHER=>Then where's the blame? Any one of us, under the same circumstances, would havehelped the Countess, just as the secretary did.
JACKSON=>He was still helping her a year later, then, because somebody met them livingtogether at Lausanne.
ARCHER=>Living together? Well why not? Who has the right to make her life over if shehasn't? Why should we bury a woman alive if her husband prefers to live withwhores?
JACKSON=>Oh, it's hardly a question of entombment. The Countess is here, after all. Or doyou believe that women should share the same freedoms as men?
ARCHER=>I suppose I do. Yes, I do.
JACKSON=>Well, apparently Count Olenski also takes a similarly modern view. I've never heardof him lifting a finger to get his wife back.
NARRATOR=>Three days later, the unthinkable happened. Mrs. Manson Mingott sent outinvitations summoning everyone to a "formal dinner. "Such an occasion demanded themost careful consideration. It required the appropriate plate. It also called forthree extra footmen, two dishes for each course and a Roman punch in the middle. The dinner, New York read on the invitation, was "to meet the Countess Olenska. "And New York declined.
MRS. ARCHER=>"Regret. ""Unable to accept. "Without a single explanation or excuse. Even someof our own. No one even cares enough to conceal their feeling about the Countess. This is a disgrace. For our whole family. And an awful blow to Catherine Mingott.
NARRATOR=>They all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world. The real thing was never said ordone or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs. These signswere not always subtle, and all the more significant for that. The refusals weremore than a simple snubbing. They were an eradication.
MRS. ARCHER=>Don't tell me all this modern newspaper rubbish about a New York aristocracy. Thiscity has always been a commercial community, and there are not more than threefamilies in it who can claim an aristocratic origin in the real sense of the word. Even dear Mr. Welland made his money in enterprise. So. We will take up this matter with the van der Luydens.
MRS. ARCHER=>You should come with me, Newland. Louisa van der Luyden is fond of you, and ofcourse it's on account of May we're doing this.
ARCHER=>Of course.
MRS. ARCHER=>If we don't all stand together, there'll be no such thing as society left.
HENRY=>And all this, you think, was due to some intentional interference by. . .
ARCHER=>. . . Larry Lefferts, yes sir. I'm certain of it.
LOUISA=>But why?
ARCHER=>Well. Excuse me but. . .
LOUISA=>Please, go on.
ARCHER=>Larry's been going it harder than usual lately. Some service person in theirvillage or someone, and it's getting noticed. Whenever poor Gertrude Leffertsbegins to suspect something about her husband, Larry starts making some greatdiversionary fuss to show how moral he is. He's simply using Countess Olenska as alightning rod.
LOUISA=>Extraordinary.
HENRY=>Not at all, my dear, I'm afraid.
MRS. ARCHER=>We all felt this slight on the Countess should not pass without consulting you.
HENRY=>Well, it's the principle that I dislike. I mean to say, as long as a member of awell-known family is backed by that family, it should be considered final.
LOUISA=>It seems so to me.
HENRY=>So with Louisa's permission. . . and with Catherine Mingott's, of course. . . we aregiving a little dinner for our cousin the Duke of St. Austrey, who arrives next weekon the Russia. I;m sure Louisa will be glad as I am if Countess Olenska willlet us include her among our guests.
NARRATOR=>The occasion was a solemn one and the Countess Olenska arrived rather late. Yet sheentered without any appearance of haste or embarrassment the drawing room in whichNew York's most chosen company was somewhat awfully assembled.
NARRATOR=>The van der Luydens stood above all the city's families. They dwelled in a kind ofsuper-terrestrial twilight, and dining with them was at best no light matter. Dining there with a Duke who was their cousin was almost a religious solemnity. TheTrevenna George II plate was out. So was the van der Luyden Lowestoft, from theEast India Company, and the Dagonet Crown Derby. When the van der Luydens chose,they knew how to give a lesson.
NARRATOR=>It was not the custom in New York drawing rooms for a lady to get up and walk awayfrom one gentleman in order to seek the company of another. But the Countess didnot observe this rule.
ELLEN=>I want you to talk to me about May.
ARCHER=>You knew the Duke before?
ELLEN=>From Nice. We used to see him every winter. He's very fond of gambling and used tocome to our house a great deal. I think he's the dullest man I ever met. But he'sadmired here. I suppose he must seem the very image of traditional Europe. Can Itell you, though. . . . . . what most interests me about New York? It's that nothing has to be traditionalhere. All this blind obeying of tradition. . . somebody else's tradition. . . isthoroughly needless. It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it acopy of another country. Do you suppose Christopher Columbus would have taken allthat trouble just to go to the opera with Larry Lefferts?
ARCHER=>I think if he knew Lefferts was here the Santa Maria would never have leftport.
ELLEN=>And May. Does she share these views?
ARCHER=>If she does, she'd never say so.
ELLEN=>Are you very much in love with her?
ARCHER=>As much as a man can be.
ELLEN=>Do you think there's a limit?
ARCHER=>If there is, I haven't found it.
ELLEN=>Ah, it's really and truly a romance, then. Not in the least arranged.
ARCHER=>Have you forgotten? In our country we don't allow marriages to be arranged.
ELLEN=>Yes, I forgot, I'm sorry, I sometimes make these mistakes. I don't always rememberthat everything here is good that was. . . that was bad where I came from.
ARCHER=>I'm so sorry. But you are among friends here, you know.
ELLEN=>Yes, I know. That's why I came home.
ELLEN=>You'll want to be with May.
ARCHER=>She's already surrounded. I have so many rivals.
ELLEN=>Then stay with me a little longer.
ARCHER=>Yes.
HENRY=>Countess, if I may. Mr. Urban Dagonet.
ELLEN=>Tomorrow then. After five. I'll expect you.
ARCHER=>Tomorrow.
LOUISA=>It was good of you to devote yourself to Madame Olenska so unselfishly, dearNewland. I told Henry he really must rescue you. I think I've never seen Maylooking lovelier. The Duke thinks her the handsomest woman in the room.
MAID=>Verra, verra.
ELLEN=>Do you like this odd little housoe? To me it's like heaven.
ARCHER=>You've arranged it delightfully.
ELLEN=>Yes. Some of the things I managed to bring with me. Little pieces of wreckage. Atleast it's less gloomy than the van der Luydens', and not so difficult to be alone.
ARCHER=>I'm sure it's often thought the van der Luydens' is gloomy, though I've never heardit said before. But do you really like to be alone?
ELLEN=>As long as my friends keep me from being lonely.
ELLEN=>I see you've already chosen your corner. This is the hour I like best, don't you?
ARCHER=>I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour. I'm sure Beaufort can be very intriguing.
ELLEN=>He took me to see some houses. I'm told I must move, even though this street seemsperfectly respectable.
ARCHER=>Yes, but it's not fashionable.
ELLEN=>Is fashion such a serious consideration?
ARCHER=>Among people who have nothing more serious to consider.
ELLEN=>And how would these people consider my street?
ARCHER=>Oh, well, fleetingly, I'm afraid. Look at your neighbors. Dressmakers. Birdstuffers. Cafe owners.
ELLEN=>I'll count on you to always let me know about such important things.
ARCHER=>The van der Luydens do nothing by halves. All New York laid itself out for you lastnight.
ELLEN=>It was so kind. Such a nice party.
ARCHER=>The van der Luydens are the most powerful influence in New York society. And theyreceive very seldom, because of cousin Louisa's health.
ELLEN=>Perhaps that's the reason then.
ARCHER=>The reason?
ELLEN=>For their influence. They make themselves so rare.
ELLEN=>But of course you must tell me.
ARCHER=>No, it's you telling me.
ELLEN=>Then we can both help each other. Just tell me what to do.
ARCHER=>There are so many people already to tell you what to do.
ELLEN=>They're all a little angry with me, I think. For setting up for myself.
ARCHER=>Still, your family can advise you. . . show you the way.
ELLEN=>Is New York such a labyrinth? I thought it was so straight up and down, like FifthAvenue, with all the cross-streets numbered and big honest labels on everything.
ARCHER=>Everything is labeled. But everybody is not.
ELLEN=>There are only two people here who make me think they can help and understand. Youand Mr. Beaufort.
ARCHER=>I understand. Just don't let go of your old friends' hands so quickly.
ELLEN=>Then I must count on you for warnings, too.
ARCHER=>All the older women like and admire you. They want to help.
ELLEN=>Oh, I know, I know. But only if they don't hear anything unpleasant. Does no onehere want to know the truth, Mr. Archer? The real loneliness is living among allthese kind people who only ask you to pretend.
ARCHER=>No, no, you musn't. Madame Olenska. Ellen.
ELLEN=>No one cries here, either? I suppose there's no need to.
FLORIST=>Oh, Mr. Archer, good evening. We didn't see you this morning, and weren't surewhether to send Miss Welland the usual. . .
ARCHER=>The lilies-of-the-valley, yes. We'd better make it a standing order.
ARCHER=>And those roses. I'll give you another address.
ARCHER=>They'll go at once?
MAY=>It's wonderful to wake every morning with lilies-of-the-valley in my room. It'slike being with you.
ARCHER=>They came late yesterday, I know. Somehow the time got away from me.
MAY=>Still, you always remember.
ARCHER=>I sent some roses to your cousin Ellen, too. Was that right?
MAY=>Very right. She didn't mention it at lunch today, though. She said she'd gottenwonderful orchids from Mr. Beaufort and a whole hamper of carnations from CousinHenry van der Luyden. She was so very delighted. Don't people send flowers inEurope?
MAY=>Well, I know you do consider it a long time.
ARCHER=>Very long.
MAY=>But the Chivers were engaged for a year and a half. Larry Lefferts and Gertrudewere engaged for two. I'm sure Mama expects something customary.
ARCHER=>Ever since you were little your parents let you have your way. You're almosttwenty-two. Just tell your mother what you want.
MAY=>But that's why it would be so difficult. I couldn't refuse her the very last thingshe'd ever ask of me as a little girl.
ARCHER=>Can't you and I just strike out for ourselves, May?
MAY=>Shall we elope?
ARCHER=>If you would.
MAY=>You do love me, Newland. I'm so happy.
ARCHER=>Why not be happier?
MAY=>I couldn't be happier, dearest. Did I tell you I showed Ellen the ring you chose? She thinks it's the most beautiful setting she ever saw. She said there was nothinglike it in the rue de la Paix. I do love you, Newland. Everything you do is sospecial.
LETTERBLAIR=>Countess Olenska wants to sue her husband for divorce. It's been suggested that shemeans to marry again, although she denies it.
ARCHER=>I beg your pardon, sir. But because of my engagement, perhaps one of the othermembers of our firm could consider the matter.
LETTERBLAIR=>But precisely because of your prospective alliance. . . and considering that severalmembers of the family have already asked for you. . . I'd like you to consider thecase.
ARCHER=>It's a family matter. Perhaps, it's best settled by the family.
LETTERBLAIR=>Oh their position is clear. They are entirely, and rightly, against a divorce. ButCountess Olenska still insists on a legal opinion. But really, what's the use of adivorce? She's here, he's there and the whole Atlantic's between them. As thingsgo, Olenski's acted generously. He's already returned some of her money withoutbeing asked. She'll never get a dollar more than that. Although I understand sheattaches no importance to the money, other than the support it provides for MedoraManson. Considering all that, the wisest thing really is to do as the family says. Just let well enough alone.
ARCHER=>I think that's for her to decide.
LETTERBLAIR=>Have you considered the consequences if the Countess decides for divorce?
ARCHER=>Consequences for the Countess?
LETTERBLAIR=>For everyone.
ARCHER=>I don't think the Count's accusations amount to anything more than vague charges.
LETTERBLAIR=>It will make for some talk.
ARCHER=>Well I have heard talk about the Countess and her secretary. I heard it even beforeI read the legal papers.
LETTERBLAIR=>It's certain to be unpleasant.
ARCHER=>Unpleasant!
LETTERBLAIR=>Divorce is always unpleasant. Don't you agree?
ARCHER=>Naturally.
LETTERBLAIR=>Then I can count on you. The family can count on you. You'll use you influenceagainst the divorce?
ARCHER=>I can't promise that. Not until I see the Countess.
LETTERBLAIR=>I don't understand you, Mr. Archer.
LETTERBLAIR=>Do you want to marry into a family with ascandalous divorce suit hanging over it?
ARCHER=>I don't think that has anything to do with the case.
ARCHER=>Can someone take this for me, please. To the Countess.
BEAUFORT=>Three days at Skuytercliff with the van der Luydens? You'd better take your fur anda hot water bottle.
ELLEN=>Is the house that cold?
BEAUFORT=>No, but Louisa is. Join me at Delmonicos Sunday instead. I'm having a nice oystersupper, in your honor. Private room, congenial company. Artists and so on.
ELLEN=>That's very tempting. I haven't met a single artist since I've been here.
ARCHER=>I know one or two painters I could bring to see you, if you'd allow me.
BEAUFORT=>Painters? Are there any painters in New York?
ELLEN=>Thank you. But I was really thinking of singers, actors, musicians. Dramaticartists. There were always so many in my husband's house. Can I write tomorrow and let you know? It's too late to decide this evening.
BEAUFORT=>Is this late?
ELLEN=>Yes, because I still have to talk business with Mr. Archer.
BEAUFORT=>Oh. Of course, Newland, if you can persuade the Countess to change her mind aboutSunday, you can join us too.
ELLEN=>You know painters, then? You live in their milieu?
ARCHER=>Oh, not exactly.
ELLEN=>But you care for such things?
ARCHER=>Immensely. When I'm in Paris or London I never miss an exhibition. I try to keepup.
ELLEN=>I used to care immensely too. My life was full of such things. But now I want tocast off all my old life. . . to become a complete American and try to be likeeverybody else.
ARCHER=>You'll never be like everybody else.
ELLEN=>Don't say that to me, please. I just want to put all the old things behind me.
ARCHER=>I know. Mr. Letterblair told me.
ELLEN=>Mr. Letterblair?
ARCHER=>Yes, I've come because he asked me to. I'm in the firm.
ELLEN=>You mean it's you who'll manage everything for me? I can talk to you? That's somuch easier.
ARCHER=>Yes. . . I'm here to talk about it. I've read all the legal papers, and the letterfrom the Count.
ELLEN=>It was vile.
ARCHER=>But if he chooses to fight the case, he can say things that might be unpleas. . . mightbe disagreeable to you. Say them publicly, so that they could be damaging evenif. . .
ELLEN=>If?
ARCHER=>Even if they were unfounded.
ELLEN=>What harm could accusations like that do me here?
ARCHER=>Perhaps more harm than anywhere else. Our legislation favors divorce. But oursocial customs don't.
ELLEN=>Yes. So my family tells me. Our family. You'll be my cousin soon. And you agreewith them?
ARCHER=>If what your husband hints is true, or you have no way of disproving it. . . yes. Whatcould you possibly gain that would make up for the scandal.
ELLEN=>My freedom. Is that nothing?
ARCHER=>But aren't you free already? It's my business to help you see things just the waythe people who are fondest of you see them, all your friends and relations. If Ididn't show you honestly how they judge such questions, it wouldn't be fair of me,would it?
ELLEN=>No. It wouldn't be fair. Very well. I'll do as you wish.
ARCHER=>I do. . . I do want to help you.
ELLEN=>You do help me.
ELLEN=>Good night, cousin.
LEFFERTS=>It's fascinating. Every season the same play, the same scene, the same effect onthe audience.
LEFFERTS=>Remarkable isn't it, Newland?
ARCHER=>These actors certainly are. They're even better than the case in London.
BEAUFORT=>You see this play even when you travel? I'd travel to get away from it.
JACKSON=>It was a reception at Mrs. Struthers'. Held on the Lord's day, but with champagneand singing from the tabletops. People say there was dancing.
REGINA=>A real French Sunday, then.
ELLEN=>Do you think her lover will send her a box of yellow roses tomorrow morning?
ARCHER=>I was. . . I was thinking about that, too. The farewell scene. .
ELLEN=>Yes, I know. It touches me as well.
ARCHER=>Usually, I leave after that scene. To take the picture away with me.
ELLEN=>I had a letter from May. From St. Augustine.
ARCHER=>They always winter there. Her mother's bronchitis.
ELLEN=>And what do you do while May is away?
ARCHER=>I do my work.
ELLEN=>I do want you to know. What you advised me was right. Things can be so difficultsometimes. . . And I'm so grateful.
NARRATOR=>The next day, Newland Archer searched the city in vain for yellow roses. From hisoffice he sent a note to Madame Olenska asking to call that afternoon and requestinga reply by messenger. There was no reply that day. Or the next. And when yellowroses were again available, Archer passes them by. It was only on the third daythat he heard from her, by post, from the van der Luydens' country home.
ELLEN=>"I ran away the day after I saw you at the play, and these kind friends have takenme in. I wanted to be quiet and think things over. I feel so safe here. Iwish. . . that you were with us. Yours sincerely. . . "
NARRATOR=>He had a still outstanding invitation from the Lefferts' for a weekend on the Hudsonand he hoped it was not too late to reply. Their house was not far from the van derLuydens.
ARCHER=>I came to see what you were running away from.
ELLEN=>I knew you'd come
ARCHER=>That shows you wanted me to.
ELLEN=>Cousin May wrote she asked you to take care of me.
ARCHER=>I didn't need to be asked.
ELLEN=>Why? Does that mean I'm so helpless and defenseless? Or that women here are soblessed they never feel need?
ARCHER=>What sort of need?
ELLEN=>Please don't ask me. I don't speak your language.
ELLEN=>Henry left the old Patroon house open for me. I wanted to see it.
ARCHER=>When you wrote me, you were unhappy.
ELLEN=>Yes. But I can't feel unhappy when you're here.
ARCHER=>I can't be here long.
ELLEN=>I know. But I'm a little impulsive. I live in the moment when I'm happy.
ARCHER=>Ellen. If you really wanted me to come. . . if I'm really to help you. . . you must tellme what you're running from.
ARCHER=>Ah!
ARCHER=>Is he what you were running from? Or what you expected?
ELLEN=>I didn't know he was here.
ARCHER=>Hello, Beaufort!This way!Madame Olenska was expecting you.
BEAUFORT=>Well, you certainly led me a bit of a chase, making me come all this was just totell you I'd found the perfect little house. It's not on the market yet, so youmust take it at once.
BEAUFORT=>Well, Archer. Rusticating?
NARRATOR=>That night he did not take the customary comfort in his monthly shipment of booksfrom London. The taste of the usual was like cinders in his mouth, and there weremoments when he felt as if he were being buried alive under his future.
ELLEN=>"Newland. Come late tomorrow. I must explain to you. "
MAY=>Newland!Has anything happened?
ARCHER=>Yes. I found I had to see you.
ARCHER=>What is it?
MAY=>Nothing.
ARCHER=>Tell me what you do all day.
MAY=>Well, there are a few pleasant people from Philadelphia and Baltimore who werepicnicking at the inn. The Merry's are planning to lay out a lawn tennis court. . .
ARCHER=>But I thought. . . I came here because I thought I could persuade you to break awayfrom all that. To advance our engagement.
ARCHER=>Don't you understand how much I want to marry you? Why should we dream away anotheryear?
MAY=>I'm not sure I do understand. Is it because you're not certain of still feeling thesame way about me?
ARCHER=>God, I. . . maybe. . . I don't know.
MAY=>Is there someone else?
ARCHER=>Someone else? Between you and me?
MAY=>Let's talk frankly, Newland. Sometimes I've felt a difference in you, especiallysince our engagement.
MAY=>If it's untrue then it won't hurt to talk about it. And if it's true. . . whyshouldn't we talk about it now? You might have made a mistake.
ARCHER=>If I'd made some sort of mistake, would I be down here asking you to hurry ourmarriage?
MAY=>I don't know. You might. It would be one way to settle the question. At Newport,two years ago, before we were. . . promised. . . everyone said there was. . . someone elsefor you. I even saw you sitting together with her once, I think. On a verandah,at a dance. When she came back into the house, her face was sad, and I felt sorryfor her. Even after, when we were engaged, I could see how she looked.
ARCHER=>Is that what you've been concerned about? That's long past.
MAY=>Then is there something else?
ARCHER=>Of course not.
MAY=>Whatever it may have been, Newland, I couldn't have my happiness made out of a wrongto somebody else. We couldn't build a life on a foundation like that. If promiseswere made. . . or pledges. . . if you said something to the. . . the person we've spokenof. . . if you feel in some way pledged to her. . . and there's any way you can fulfillyour pledge. . . even by her getting a divorce. . . Newland, don't give her up because ofme!
ARCHER=>There are no pledges. There are no promises that matter.
ARCHER=>That is all I've been trying to say. There is no one between us, May. There isnothing between us. That is precisely my argument for marrying quickly.
NARRATOR=>He could feel her dropping back to inexpressive girlishness. Her conscience hadbeen eased of its burden. It was wonderful, he thought, how such depths of feelingcould co-exist with such an absense of imagination.
MRS. MINGOTT=>And did you succeed?
ARCHER=>No. But I'd still like to be married in April. With your help.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Well, you're seeing the Mingott way. When I built this house the family reacted asif I was moving to California. Now you're challenging everyone.
ARCHER=>Is this really so difficult?
MRS. MINGOTT=>The entire family is difficult. Not one of them wants to be different. And whenthey are different they end up like Ellen's parents. Nomads. Continentalwanderers. Or like dear Medora, dragging Ellen about after they died, lavishingher with an expensive but incoherent education. Out of all of them, I don't believethere's one that takes after me but my little Ellen. You've got a quick eye. Why in the world didn't you marry her?
ARCHER=>For one thing, she wasn't there to be married.
MRS. MINGOTT=>No, to be sure. And she's still not. The Count, you know. He's sent a letter.
ARCHER=>No, I didn't know.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Mr. Letterblair says the Count wants Ellen back. On her own terms.
ARCHER=>I don't believe it.
MRS. MINGOTT=>The Count certainly does not defend himself. I will say that. And Ellen would begiving up a great deal to stay here. There's her old life. Gardens at Nice withterraces of roses. Jewels, of course. Music and conversation. She says she goesunnoticed in Europe, but I know that her portrait has been painted nine times. Allthat, and the remorse of a guilty husband. Ellen says she cares for none of it, butstill. These are things that must be weighted.
ARCHER=>I would rather see her dead.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Would you? Would you really? We should remember marriage is marriage. And Ellenis still a wife.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Ellen, see who's here.
ELLEN=>Yes, I know. I went to see your mother to ask where you'd gone. Since you never answered mynote.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Because he was in such a rush to get married, I'm sure. Fresh off the train andstraight here. He wants me to use all my influence, just to marry his sweetheartsooner.
ELLEN=>Well surely, Granny, between us we can persuade the Wellands to do as he wishes.
MRS. MINGOTT=>There, Newland, you see. Right to the quick of the problem. Like me. I told him he should have married you.
ELLEN=>And what did he say?
MRS. MINGOTT=>Oh, my darling, I leave you to find that out.
ARCHER=>When can I see you?
ELLEN=>Natasia, take those to that nice family down the street. And come right back. TheStruthers' are sending a carriage for me at seven.
ELLEN=>Who's ridiculous enough to send me a bouquet? I'm not going to a ball. And I'm notengaged.
ELLEN=>I'm sure Granny must have told you everything about me.
ARCHER=>She did say you were used to all kinds of splendors we can't give you here.
ELLEN=>Well, I'll tell you. In almost everything she says there's something true, andsomething untrue. Why? What has she been telling you?
ARCHER=>I think she believes you might go back to your husband. I think she believes youmight at least consider it.
ELLEN=>A lot of things have been believed of me. But if she thinks I would consider it,that also means she would consider it for me. As Granny is weighing you idea ofadvancing the marriage.
ARCHER=>May and I had a frank talk in Florida. Probably our first. She wants a longengagement to give me time. . .
ELLEN=>Time to give her up for another woman?
ARCHER=>If I want to.
ELLEN=>That's very noble.
ARCHER=>Yes. But it's ridiculous.
ELLEN=>Why? Because there is no other woman?
ARCHER=>No. Because I don't mean to marry anyone else.
ELLEN=>This other woman. . . does she love you, too?
ARCHER=>There is no other woman. I mean, the person May was thinking of. . . was never. . . . . . she guessed the truth. There is another woman. But not the one she thinks.
ELLEN=>Don't make love to me. Too many people have done that.
ARCHER=>I've never made love to you. But you are the woman I would have married if it hadbeen possible for either of us.
ELLEN=>Possible? You can say that when you're the one who's made it impossible.
ARCHER=>I've made it. . .
ELLEN=>Isn't it you who made me give up divorcing? Didn't you talk to me, here in thisroom, about sacrifice and sparing scandal because my family was going to be yourfamily? And I did what you asked me. For May's sake. And for yours.
ARCHER=>But there were things in your husband's letter. . .
ELLEN=>I had nothing to fear from that letter. Absolutely nothing. You were just afraidof scandal for yourself, and for May.
ARCHER=>Ellen. No. Nothing's done that can't be undone. I'm still free. You can be, too.
ARCHER=>No!Everything is different. Do you see me marrying May now?
ELLEN=>Would you ask her that question? Would you?
ARCHER=>I have to ask her. It's too late to do anything else.
ELLEN=>You say that because it's easy, not because it's true.
ARCHER=>This has changed everything
ELLEN=>No. The good things can't change. All that you've done for me, Newland, that Inever knew. Going to the van der Luydens because people refused to meet me. Announcing you engagement at the ball so there would be two families standing behindme instead of one. I never understood how deadful people thought I was.
ELLEN=>Granny blurted it out one day. I was stupid, I never thought. New York seemed sokind and glad to see me. But there was no one as kind as you. They never knew whatit meant to be tempted. But you did. You understood. You hated happiness broughtby disloyalty and cruelty and indifference. I'd never known that before, and it'sbetter than anything I've known.
ELLEN=>Newland. You couldn't be happy if it meant being cruel. If we act any other wayI'll be making you act against what I love in you most. And I can't go back to thatway of thinking. Don't you see? I can't love you unless I give you up.
ARCHER=>And Beaufort, with his orchids? Can you love him? May is ready to give me up!
ELLEN=>Three days after you pleaded with her to advance your engagement she will give youup?
ARCHER=>She refused!That gives me the right. . .
ELLEN=>The right? The same kind of ugly right as my husband claims in his letters?
ARCHER=>No, of course not!But if we do this now. . . afterward, it will only be worse foreveryone if we. . .
ELLEN=>No, no, no!
ELLEN=>I won't be going out tonight after all.
ARCHER=>Please don't sacrifice. I have no right to keep you from your friends.
MAID=>This was delivered.
MAY=>"Granny's telegram was successful. Papa and Mama agreed to marriage after Easter. Only a month? !I will telegraph Newland. I'm too happy for words and love youdearly. Your grateful cousin May. "
NARRATOR=>There had been wild rumors right up to the wedding day, that Mrs. Mingott wouldactually attend the ceremony. It was known that she had sent a carpenter to measurethe front pew in case it might be altered to accomodate her. But this idea, likethe great lady herself, proved to be unwieldy, and she settled for giving thewedding breakfast. The Countess Olenska sent her regrets - she was travelling withan aunt - but gave the bride and groom an exquisite piece of old lace. Two elderlyaunts in Rhinebeck offered a honeymoon cottage, and since it was thought "veryEnglish" to have a country-house on loan, their offer was accepted. When the houseproved suddenly uninhabitable, however, Henry van der Luyden stepped in to offer anold cottage on his property nearby. May accepted the offer as a surprise for herhusband. She had never seen the house, but her cousin Ellen had mentioned it once. She had said it was the only house in America where she could imagine beingperfectly happy. They travelled to the expected places, which May had never seen. In London, Archer ordered his clothes, and they went to the National Gallery, andsometimes to the theatre.
MAY=>I hope I don't look ridiculous. I've never dined out in London.
ARCHER=>Englishwomen dress just like everybody else in the evening, don't they?
MAY=>How can you even ask that, when they're always at the theatre in old ball-dressesand bare heads.
ARCHER=>Well perhaps they save their new dresses for home.
MAY=>Then I shouldn't have worn this?
ARCHER=>No. You look fine. Quite beautiful.
NARRATOR=>In Paris, she ordered her clothes. There were trunks of dresses from Worth. Theyvisited the Tuileries.
NARRATOR=>Rochee modelled May's hands in marble. And occasionally they dined out.
NARRATOR=>Archer had gradually reverted to his old inherited ideas about marriage. It wasless trouble to conform with tradition. There was no use trying to emancipate awife who hadn't the dimmest notion that she was not free.
ARCHER=>We had an awfully good talk. Interesting fellow. We talked about books and things. I asked him to dinner.
MAY=>The Frenchman? I didn't have much chance to talk to him, but wasn't he a littlecommon?
ARCHER=>Common? I thought he was clever.
MAY=>I suppose I shouldn't have known if he was clever.
ARCHER=>Then I won't ask him to dine.
NARRATOR=>With a chill he knew that, in future, many problems would be solved for him in thissame way.
NARRATOR=>The first six months of marriage were usually said to be the hardest, and afterthat, he thought, they would have pretty nearly finished polishing down all therough edges. But May's pressure was already wearing down the very roughness he mostwanted to keep. As for the madness with Madame Olenska, Archer trained himself toremember it as the last of his discarded experiments. She remained in his memorysimply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.
LEFFERTS=>She's very deft.
BEAUFORT=>Yes. But that's the only kind of target she'll ever hit.
NARRATOR=>No one could ever be jealous of May's triumphs. She managed to give the feelingthat she would have been just as serene without them.
NARRATOR=>But what if all her calm, her niceness, were just a negation, a curtain dropped infront of an emptiness? Archer felt he had never yet lifted that curtain.
MAY=>Has Regina Beaufort been here at all this summer?
ARCHER=>I don't know. There's a great deal of gossip. I expect Beaufort will bring AnnieRing here any day.
MAY=>Not even he would dare that!
ARCHER=>He's reckless in everything. Even his railway speculations are turning bad. But hejust answers every rumor with a fresh extravagance.
MAY=>I heard he gave Regina pearls worth half a million.
ARCHER=>He had no choice.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Quite stunning. It's Julius Beaufort who donates the club's prizes, isn't it. Thislooks like him. Of course. And it will make quite an heirloom, my dear. Youshould leave it to your eldest daughter.
MRS. MINGOTT=>What's the matter, aren't there going to be any daughters? Only boys? What, can'tI say that either? Look at her, blushing!
MRS. MINGOTT=>Ellen!Ellen, are you upstairs?
MRS. MINGOTT=>She's over from Portsmouth, spending the day with me. It's such a nuisance. Shejust won't stay in Newport, insists on putting up with those. . . what's their name. . . Blenkers. But I gave up arguing with young people about fifty years ago. . . Ellen!
MAID=>I'm sorry, ma'am, Miss Ellen's not in the house.
MRS. MINGOTT=>She's left?
MAID=>I saw her going down the shore path.
MRS. MINGOTT=>Run down and fetch her, like a good grandson. May can tell me all the gossip aboutJulius Beaufort. Go ahead. I know she'll want to see you both.
NARRATOR=>He had heard her name often enough during the year and a half since they had lastmet. He was even familiar with the main incidents of her life. But he heard allthese accounts with detachment, as if listening to reminiscences of someone longdead. But the past had come again into the present, as in those newly discoveredcaverns in Tuscany, where children had lit bunches of straw and seen old imagesstaring from the wall.
NARRATOR=>He gave himself a single chance. She must turn before the sailboat crosses the LimeRock light. Then he would go to her.
MAY=>I'm sorry you didn't find her. But I've heard she's so changed.
ARCHER=>Changed?
MAY=>So indifferent to her old friends. Summering in Portsmouth, moving to Washington. Sometimes I think we've always bored her. I wonder if she wouldn't be happier withher husband after all.
ARCHER=>I don't think I've ever heard you be cruel before.
MAY=>Cruel?
ARCHER=>Even demons don't think people are happier in hell.
MAY=>Then she shouldn't have married abroad.
ARCHER=>Let me.
MRS. WELLAND=>The Blenkers. A party for the Blenkers?
JANEY=>Who are they?
MAY=>The Portsmouth people, I think. The ones Countess Olenska is staying with.
MRS. ARCHER=>"Professor and Mrs. Emerson Sillerton request the pleasure. . . Wednesday afternoonclub. . . at 3 o'clock punctually. To meet Mrs. and the the Misses Blenker. RedGables, Catherine Street. "I don't think we can decline.
JANEY=>I don't see why, really. He's an archaeologist and he lives here even in winter. He's always taking his poor wife to tombs in the Yucatan instead of to Paris. He'sgot a house full of long-haired men and short-haired women, and. . .
MRS. ARCHER=>And he is Sillerton Jackson's cousin.
JANEY=>Of course.
MRS. WELLAND=>Some of us will have to go.
MAY=>I'll go over. And, Janey, why don't you come with me. I'm sure Cousin Ellen willbe there. It will give you a chance to see her. Newland, you can find some way to spend the afternoon, can't you?
ARCHER=>Oh I think for a change I'll just save it instead of spending it. Maybe drive tothe farm to see about a new horse for the brougham.
KATIE BLENKER=>Hello?
KATIE BLENKER=>I'm sorry, did you ring, I've been asleep in the hammock. . .
ARCHER=>I didn't mean to disturb you. Are you Miss Blenker? I'm Newland Archer.
KATIE=>I've heard so much about you.
ARCHER=>I came up the island to see about a new horse, and I thought I'd call. But thehouse seemed empty. . .
KATIE=>It is empty. They're all at the party. The one the Sillertons are giving for us. Didn't you know?
KATIE=>Everyone's there but me, with my fever, and Countess Olenska. . . oh, you found myparasol!
KATIE=>It's my best one. It's from the Cameroons.
ARCHER=>The Countess was called away?
KATIE=>A telegram came from Boston. She said she might be gone for two days. I do lovethe way she does her hair, don't you? It reminds me of Sir Walter Scott.
ARCHER=>You don't know. . . I'm sorry. . . I've got to be in Boston tomorrow. You wouldn't knowwhere she was staying?
ELLEN=>Oh. Oh.
ARCHER=>I'm here on business. Just got here, actually. You're doing your hair differently.
ELLEN=>Only because the maid's not with me. She stayed back in Portsmouth. I'm only herefor two days, it didn't seem worth. . .
ARCHER=>You're travelling alone?
ELLEN=>Yes. Why, do you think it's a little dangerous?
ARCHER=>Well, it's unconventional.
ELLEN=>I suppose it is. I hadn't thought of it. I've just done something so much moreunconventional. I've refused to take back money that belonged to me.
ARCHER=>Someone came with an offer?
ARCHER=>What were the conditions?
ELLEN=>I refused.
ARCHER=>Tell me the conditions.
ELLEN=>Nothing unbearable, really. Just to sit at the head of his table now and then.
ARCHER=>And he wants you back, at any price?
ELLEN=>Well, it's a considerable price. At least it's considerable for me.
ARCHER=>So you came to meet him.
ELLEN=>My husband? Here? No, of course not. He sent someone.
ARCHER=>His secretary?
ELLEN=>Yes. He's still here, in fact. He insisted on waiting. In case I changed my mind. They told you at the hotel I was here?
ELLEN=>You haven't changed, Newland.
ARCHER=>I had changed, till I saw you again.
ELLEN=>Please don't.
ARCHER=>Just give me the day. I'll say anything you like. Or nothing. I won't speakunless you tell me to. All I want is some time with you. All I want is to listento you. I want to get you away from that man. Was he coming to the hotel?
ELLEN=>At eleven. Just in case. . .
ARCHER=>Then we must leave now. It's been a hundred years since we've met.
ELLEN=>Where will we go?
ARCHER=>Where?
ELLEN=>Somewhere cool, at any rate.
ARCHER=>We'll take the steamboat down to Point Arley. There's an inn.
ELLEN=>I'll have to leave a note at the hotel.
ARCHER=>Write it here. I have the paper. . . you see how everything's predestined? . . . andthis. . . have you seen these. . . the new stylographic pen. . .
ARCHER=>Just steady the case on your knee, and I'll get the pen going in a second. . .
ARCHER=>It's like jerking down the mercury in a thermometer. Now try.
ARCHER=>Shall I take it in?
ELLEN=>I'll only be a moment.
ELLEN=>Why didn't you come down to the beach to get me the day I was at Granny's?
ARCHER=>Because you didn't turn around. You didn't know I was there. I swore I wouldn'tcall you unless you looked around.
ELLEN=>But I didn't look on purpose.
ARCHER=>You knew?
ELLEN=>I recognized the carriage when you drove in. So I went to the beach.
ARCHER=>To get as far away from me as you could.
ELLEN=>As I could. Yes.
ARCHER=>Well you see, then. It's no use. It's better to face each other.
ELLEN=>I only want to be honest with you.
ARCHER=>Honest? Isn't that why you always admired Julius Beaufort? He was more honest thanthe rest of us, wasn't he? We've got no character, no color, no variety. I wonderwhy you just don't go back to Europe.
ELLEN=>I believe it's because of you.
ARCHER=>Me? I'm the man who married one woman because another one told him to.
ELLEN=>You promised not to say those things today.
ARCHER=>I can't keep that promise.
ELLEN=>And what about May? What does May feel? That's the thing we've always got to thinkof, by your own showing.
ARCHER=>My showing?
ELLEN=>Yes, yours. Otherwise everything you taught me would be a sham.
ARCHER=>If you're using my marriage as some victory of ours, then there's no reason on earthwhy you shouldn't go back. You gave me my first glimpse of a real life. Then youasked me to go on with the false one. No one can endure that.
ELLEN=>I'm enduring it.
ARCHER=>You too? All this time, you too?
ARCHER=>What's the use? We can't be like this. When will you go back?
ELLEN=>I won't. Not yet. Not as long as we both can stand it.
ARCHER=>This is not a life for you.
ELLEN=>It is. As long as it's part of yours.
ARCHER=>And the way I live. . . my life. . . how can it be part of yours?
ELLEN=>Don't. . . don't be unhappy.
ARCHER=>You won't go back? You won't go back?
ELLEN=>I won't go back.
RIVIERE=>It's Mr. Archer, I think?
ARCHER=>Yes?
RIVIERE=>My name is Reviere. We dined together in Paris last year.
ARCHER=>Oh yes. I'm sorry I didn't quite recall. . .
RIVIERE=>Quite alright. I had the advantage. I saw you yesterday in Boston.
ARCHER=>I still do not understand why we're speaking.
RIVIERE=>I came her on Count Olenska's behalf because I believed. . . in all good faith. . . thatit would be best for the Countess to return to him. I met her in Boston and toldher all the Count had said. She did me the kindness of listening carefully. Butshe's changed, Monsieur.
ARCHER=>You knew her before?
RIVIERE=>I used to see her in her husband's house. The Count would never have trusted mymission to a stranger.
ARCHER=>This change. . .
RIVIERE=>It may only have been my seeing her for the first time as she is. As an American. And if you're an American of her kind. . . of your kind. . . things are accepted incertain other societies, or at least put up with for the sake of. . . convenience. . . these things become intolerable. She made her marriage in good faith. It was afaith that the Count could not share, and could not understand. So her faith wasshattered. And it was only coming back here. . . coming home. . . that restored it. Returning to Europe would mean a life of some comfort. And considerable sacrifice. And also, I would think, no hope. I will fulfill my obligation to the Count andmeet with the family. I will tell them what he wishes and suggests for theCountess. But I ask you, Monsieur, to use you own influence with them. I. . . I begyou. . . with all the force I'm capable of. . . not to let her go back.
ARCHER=>Thank you.
MRS. ARCHER=>Well, Boston is more conservative than New York. But I always think it's a saferule for a lady to lay aside her French dresses for one season. When Old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow died, they found her standing order - forty-eight Worth dresses -still wrapped in tissue paper. When her daughters left off their mourning they worethe first lot to the Symphony without looking in advance of the fashion.
NARRATOR=>He had written to her once in Washington. Just a few lines, asking when they wereto meet again. And she wrote back "Not yet. "
JANEY=>I think it was Julius Beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clapher new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived. I must say, it takes allRegina's distinction not to look like. . .
JACKSON=>Her rivals?
JANEY=>. . . like that Annie Ring.
MRS. ARCHER=>Careful, dear.
JANEY=>Well, everybody knows.
JACKSON=>Indeed. Beaufort always put his business around. And now that his business is gonethere are bound to be disclosures.
MAY=>Gone? Is it that bad?
JACKSON=>As bad as anything I've ever heard of. Most everybody we know will be hit, one wayor another.
JACKSON=>Very difficult for Regina, of course. And it's a pity. . . it's certainly a pity. . . that Countess Olenska refused her husband's offer.
ARCHER=>Why, for God's sake?
JACKSON=>Well. . . to put it on the lowest ground. . . what's she going to live on now?
ARCHER=>Now. . . !
JACKSON=>Well, I mean now that Beaufort. . .
ARCHER=>What the hell does that mean, sir?
JACKSON=>Most of her money's invested with Beaufort, and the allowance she's been gettingfrom the family is so cut back. . .
ARCHER=>She has something, I'm sure.
JACKSON=>Oh I would think a little. Whatever remains after sustaining Medora. But I knowthe family paid close attention to Monsieur Riviere and considered the Count's offervery closely. Everyone hopes the Countess herself might simply see that livinghere, on such a small margin. . .
ARCHER=>If everyone would rather she be Beaufort's mistress than some decent fellow's wife,you've all gone about it perfectly. She won't go back.
JACKSON=>That's your opinion, eh? Well no doubt you know. I suppose she might still softenCatherine Mingott, who could give her any allowance she chooses. But the rest ofthe family has no particular interest in keeping Madame Olenska here. They'llsimply let her find her own level.
ARCHER=>Shall we go up and join my mother?
ARCHER=>The lamp is smoking again. The servants should see to it.
MAY=>I'm sorry.
ARCHER=>I may have to go to Washington for a few days.
MAY=>When?
ARCHER=>Tomorrow. I'm sorry, I should have said something before.
MAY=>On business?
ARCHER=>On business, of course. There's a patent case coming up before the Supreme Court. I just got the papers from Letterblair. It seems. . .
MAY=>Never mind. I'm sure it's too complicated. I have enough trouble managing thislamp. But the change will do you good. And you must be sure to go and see Ellen.
ARCHER=>Do something about this, will you, Agnes?
MAY=>Granny's had a stroke.
MRS. MINGOTT=>A stroke!I told them all it was just an excess of Thanksgiving. Dr. Bencomb actedmost concerned and insisted on notifying everyone as if it were the reading of mylast testament. But I won't be treated like a corpse when I'm hardly an invalid.
MRS. MINGOTT=>You're very dear to come. But perhaps you only wanted to see what I'd left you.
MAY=>Granny, that's shocking!
MRS. MINGOTT=>It was shock that did this to me. It's all due to Regina Beaufort. She came herelast night, and she asked me. . .
MRS. MINGOTT=>. . . she had the effrontery to ask me. . . to back Julius. Not to desert him, she said. To stand behind our common lineage in the Townsend family. I said to her, "Honor'salways been honor, and honesty's always been honesty, in Manson Mingott's house, andwill be 'till I'm carried out feet first. "And then. . . if you can believe it. . . shesaid to me. . . "But my name, Auntie. My name's Regina Townsend. "And I said, "Yourname was Beaufort when he covered you with jewels, and it's got to stay Beaufort nowthat he's covered you with shame. "
MRS. MINGOTT=>So I gave out. Simply gave out. Now family will be arriving from all overexpecting a funeral and they'll have to be entertained. I don't know how many notesBencomb sent out.
ARCHER=>If there's any way we can help. . .
MRS. MINGOTT=>Well, my Ellen is coming. I expressly asked for her. She arrives this afternoon onthe train. If you could fetch her. . .
ARCHER=>Of course. If May will send the brougham, I can take the ferry.
MAY=>There, you see, Granny. Everyone will be settled.
MAY=>I didn't want to worry Granny. But how can you meet Ellen and bring her back if youhave to go to Washington yourself this afternoon?
ARCHER=>I'm not going. The case is off. Postponed. I heard from Letterblair this morning.
MAY=>Postponed? How odd. Mama had a note from him this morning as well. He wasconcerned about Granny but he had to be away. He was arguing a big patent casebefore the Supreme Court. You said it was a patent case, didn't you?
ARCHER=>Well, that's it. The whole office can't go. Letterblair decided to go thismorning.
MAY=>Then it's not postponed?
ARCHER=>No. But my going is.
NARRATOR=>He knew is was two hours by ferry and carriage from the Pennsylvania terminus inJersey City back to Mrs. Mingott's. All of two hours. And maybe a little more.
ARCHER=>You didn't expect me today?
ELLEN=>No.
ARCHER=>It was Granny Mingott who sent me. She's much better. I nearly went to Washingtonto see you. We would have missed each other.
ARCHER=>Did you know. . . I hardly remembered you.
ELLEN=>Hardly remembered?
ARCHER=>I mean. . . I mean it's always the same. Each time I see you. You happen to me allover again.
ELLEN=>Oh yes. I know, I know. For me too.
ARCHER=>Your husband's secretary came to see me. The day after we met in Boston.
ARCHER=>You didn't know?
ELLEN=>No. But he told me he had met you. In Paris, I think.
ARCHER=>Ellen. . . I have to ask you. Just one thing.
ELLEN=>Yes?
ARCHER=>Was it Riviere who helped you get away after you left your husband?
ELLEN=>Yes. I owe him a great debt.
ARCHER=>I think you're the most honest woman I ever met.
ELLEN=>No. But probably one of the least fussy.
ARCHER=>Ellen, We can't stay like this. It can't last.
ELLEN=>What?
ARCHER=>Our being together and not being together. It's impossible.
ELLEN=>You shouldn't have come today.
ARCHER=>Don't be afraid. Look, I'm not even trying to touch your sleeve. Being like thisisn't what I want. I need you with me. I can even just sit still, like this, andlook at you.
ELLEN=>I think we should look at reality, not dreams.
ARCHER=>I just want us to be together.
ELLEN=>I can't be your wife, Newland. Is it your idea I should live with you as yourmistress?
ARCHER=>I want. . . somehow I want to get away with you. Find a world where words like thatwon't exist.
ELLEN=>Oh my dear. . . whare is that country? Have you ever been there? Is there anywhere wecan be happy behind the backs of people who trust us?
ARCHER=>I'm beyond caring about that.
ELLEN=>No, you're not!You've never been beyond that. I have. I know what it looks like. A lie in every silence. It's no place for us.
ELLEN=>Why are we stopping? This isn't Granny's.
ARCHER=>No. I'll get out here. You were right. I shouldn't have come today.
MAY=>What are you reading?
ARCHER=>Oh, a history. About Japan.
MAY=>Why?
ARCHER=>I don't know. Because it's a different country.
MAY=>You used to read poetry. It was so nice when you read it to me.
ARCHER=>I need some air.
MAY=>Newland!You'll catch your death.
ARCHER=>Catch my death. Of course.
NARRATOR=>But then he realized, I am dead. I've been dead for months and months. Then itoccurred to him that she might die. People did. Young people, healthy people, did. She might die, and set him free.
MAY=>Newland?
ARCHER=>Poor May.
MAY=>Poor? Why poor?
ARCHER=>Because I'll never be able to open a window without worrying you.
MAY=>I'll never worry if you're happy.
ARCHER=>And I'll never be happy unless I can open the windows.
MAY=>In this weather?
ARCHER=>I have to see you. I didn't know when you were leaving again.
ELLEN=>I'm due at Regina Beaufort's. Granny lent me her carriage.
ARCHER=>With all that's happened, you're still goinig to see Regina Beaufort?
ELLEN=>I know. Granny says Julius Beaufort is a scoundrel. But so is my husband, and thefamily still wants me to go back to him.
ARCHER=>But you won't go back?
ELLEN=>No. Granny's asked me to stay and help care for her. But I think it's me she meansto help. She said I've lived too long locked up in a cage. She's even seen to myallowance.
ARCHER=>You won't need my help if you have Granny's.
ELLEN=>I will still need your help. If I stay, we will have to help each other.
ARCHER=>I have to see you. Somewhere we can be alone.
ELLEN=>In New York?
ARCHER=>Alone. Somewhere we can be alone. There's the art museum in the park. Half pasttwo tomorrow. I'll be at the door.
ARCHER=>You came to New York because you were afraid.
ELLEN=>Afraid?
ARCHER=>Of my coming to Washington.
ELLEN=>I promised Granny to stay in her house because I thought I would be safer.
ARCHER=>Safer from me?
ARCHER=>Safer from loving me?
ELLEN=>Shall I come to you once, and then go home?
ARCHER=>Come to me once, then.
ARCHER=>When? Tomorrow?
ELLEN=>The day after.
ELLEN=>No. Don't come any farther than this.
MAY=>I'm sorry I'm late. You weren't worried, were you?
ARCHER=>Is it late?
MAY=>Past seven. I stayed at Granny's because cousin Ellen came in. We had a wonderfultalk. She was so dear. Just like the old Ellen. And Granny's so charmed by her. You do see, though, why sometimes the family has been annoyed? Going to see ReginaBeaufort in Granny's carriage. . .
ARCHER=>Aren't we dining out?
MAY=>You haven't kissed me today.
NARRATOR=>It was the custom, in old New York, for brides to appear in their wedding dressduring the first year or two of marriage. But May, since returning from Europe, hadnot worn her bridal satin until this evening.
ARCHER=>My head's bursting. Don't tell anyone, but please come home with me.
MAY=>Shouldn't you rest?
ARCHER=>My head's not as bad as that. And there's something important I have to tell youright away. May. . . There's something I've got to tell you. . . about myself. . . MadameOlenska. . .
MAY=>Oh, why should we talk about Ellen tonight?
ARCHER=>Because I should have spoken before.
MAY=>Is it really worthwhile, dear? I know I've been unfair to her at times. Perhaps weall have. You've understood her better than any of us, I suppose. But does itmatter, now that it's all over?
ARCHER=>Over? How do you mean, over?
MAY=>Why, since she's going back to Europe so soon. Granny approves and understands. She's disappointed, of course, but she's arranged to make Ellen financiallyindependent of the Count. I thought you would have heard today at your offices.
ARCHER=>It's impossible.
MAY=>Impossible? Certainly she could have stayed here, with Granny's extra money. But Iguess she's given us up after all.
ARCHER=>How do you know that?
MAY=>From Ellen. I told you I saw her at Granny's yesterday.
ARCHER=>And she told you yesterday?
MAY=>No. She sent me a note this afternoon. Do you want to see it?
MAY=>I thought you knew.
ELLEN=>"May dear, I have at last made Granny understand that my visit to her could be nomore than a visit, and she has been as kind and generous as ever. She sees now thatif I return to Europe I must live by myself. I am hurrying back to Washington topack up, and I sail next week. You must be very good to Granny when I'm gone. . . asgood as you've always been to me. If any of my friends wish to urge me to change mymind, please tell them it would be utterly useless. "
ARCHER=>Why did she write this?
MAY=>I suppose because we talked things over yesterday.
ARCHER=>What things?
MAY=>I told her I was afraid I hadn't been fair to her. I hadn't always understood howhard it must have been here. I knew you'd be the one friend she could always counton. And I wanted her to know that you and I were the same. In all our feelings. She understood why I wanted to tell her this, I think she understands everything.
MAY=>My head aches, too. Good night, dear.
NARRATOR=>It was, as Mrs. Archer said to Mrs. Welland, a great event for a young couple togive their first dinner, and it was not to be undertaken lightly. There was a hiredchef, two borrowed footmen, roses from Henderson's, Roman punch and menus ongilt-edged cards. It was considered a particular triumph that the van der Luydens,at May's request, stayed in the city to be present at her farewell dinner for theCountess Olenska.
NARRATOR=>He guessed himself to have been, for months, the center of countless silentlyobserving eyes and patiently listening ears. He understood that, somehow, theseparation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved. And heknew that now the whole tribe had rallied around his wife. He was a prisoner in thecenter of an armed camp.
JANEY=>Regina's not well at all, but that doesn't stop Beaufort from devoting as much timeto Annie Ring. . .
ARCHER=>Was the trip from Washington very tiring?
ELLEN=>The heat in the train was dreadful. But all travel has its hardships.
ARCHER=>Whatever they may be, they're worth it. Just to get away.
ARCHER=>I mean to do a lot of travelling myself soon.
ARCHER=>Philip, what about you? A little adventure? A long trip? Are you interested? Athens and Smyrna and maybe Constantinople. Then as far East as we can go.
PHILIP=>Possibly, possibly.
MRS. VAN DER LUYDEN=>But not Naples, Dr. Bencomb says there's a fever.
ARCHER=>There's India, too.
PHILIP=>You must have three weeks to do India properly.
LEFFERTS=>Beaufort may not receive invitations anymore, but it's clear he still maintains acertain position.
PHILIP=>Horizontal, from all I've heard.
LEFFERTS=>If things go on like this, we'll be seeing our children fighting for invitations toswindlers' houses and marrying Beaufort's bastards.
JACKSON=>Has he got any?
GUEST=>Careful, there, gentlemen. Draw it mild, draw it mild.
VAN DER LUYDEN=>Have you ever noticed? It's the people who have the worst cooks who are alwaysyelling about being poisoned when they dine out. Lefferts used to be a little moreadept, I thought. But then, grace is not always required. As long as one knows thesteps.
NARRATOR=>The silent organization which held this whole small world together was determined toput itself on record. It had never for a moment questioned the propriety of MadameOlenska's conduct. It had never questioned Archer's fidelity. And it had neverheard of, suspected, or even conceived possible, anything at all to the contrary. From the seamless performance of this ritual, Archer knew that New York believed himto be Madame Olenska's lover. And he understood, for the first time, that his wifeshared the belief.
ARCHER=>Shall I see you to your carriage?
MRS. VAN DER LUYDEN=>We are driving deal Ellen home.
ELLEN=>Good-bye.
ARCHER=>Good-bye. But I'll see you soon in Paris.
ELLEN=>Oh. . . if you and May could come. . .
MAY=>It did go off beautifully, didn't it.
ARCHER=>Oh. Yes.
MAY=>May I come in and talk it over?
ARCHER=>Of course. But you must be very sleepy.
MAY=>No. I'm not. I'd like to be with you a little.
ARCHER=>Fine.
ARCHER=>Since you're not tired and want to talk, there's something I have to tell you. Itried the other night.
MAY=>Oh yes, dear. Something about yourself?
ARCHER=>About myself, yes. You say you're not tired. But I am. I'm tired of everything. I want to make a break. . .
MAY=>You mean give up the law?
ARCHER=>Well, maybe. To get away, at any rate. Right away. On a long trip. Go somewherethat's so far. . .
MAY=>How far?
ARCHER=>I don't know. I thought of India. Or Japan.
MAY=>As far as that? But I'm afraid you can't, dear. . . . . . not unless you take me with you. That is, if the doctors will let me go. . . butI'm afraid they won't.
MAY=>I've been sure of something since this morning and I've been longing to tell you. . .
ARCHER=>Oh.
MAY=>You didn't guess?
ARCHER=>No. Of course, I mean, I hoped, but. . .
ARCHER=>Have you told anyone else?
MAY=>Only Mama, and your mother. And Ellen. You know I told you we'd had a long talkone afternoon. . . and how wonderful she was to me.
ARCHER=>Ah.
MAY=>Did you mind my telling her, Newland?
ARCHER=>Mind? Why should I? But that was two weeks ago, wasn't it? I thought you said youweren't sure till today.
MAY=>No. I wasn't sure then. But I told her I was. And you see. . .
MAY=>I was right.
NARRATOR=>It was the room in which most of the real things of his life had happened. Theireldest boy, Theodore, too delicate to be taken to church in midwinter, had beenchristened there. It was here that Ted took his first steps. And it was here thatArcher and his wife always discussed the future of all their children. Bill'sinterest in archaeology. Mary's passion for sport and philanthropy. Ted'sinclinations toward "art" that led to a job with an architect, as well as someconsiderable redecoration. It was in this room that Mary had announced herengagement to the dullest and most reliable of Larry Lefferts' many sons. And itwas in this room, too, that her father had kissed her through her wedding veilbefore they motored to Grace Church. He was a dutiful, loving father, and afaithful husband. When May died of infectious pneumonia after nursing Bill safelythrough, he had honestly mourned her. The world of her youth had fallen into piecesand rebuilt itself without her ever noticing. This hard bright blindness, herincapacity to recognize change, made her children conceal their views from her, justas Archer concealed his. She died thinking the world a good place, full of lovingand harmonious households like her own. Newland Archer, in his fifty- seventh year,mourned his past and honored it.
ARCHER=>Yes? Hello?
OPERATOR=>Chicago wants you.
TED=>Dad?
ARCHER=>Ted?
TED=>I'm just about finished out here, but my client wants me to look at some gardensbefore I start designing.
ARCHER=>Fine. Where?
TED=>Europe. I'll have to sail next Wednesday on the Mauretania.
ARCHER=>And miss the wedding?
TED=>Annie will wait for me. I'll be back on the first and our wedding's not 'till thefifth.
ARCHER=>I'm surprised you remember the date.
TED=>Well, I was hoping you'd join me. I'll need you to remind me of what's important. What do you say? It will be our last father and son trip.
ARCHER=>I appreciate the invitation, but. . .
TED=>Wonderful. Can you call the Cunard office first thing tomorrow?
TED=>I'm going out to Versailles with Tourneur. Will you join us?
ARCHER=>I thought I'd go to the Louvre.
TED=>I'll meet you there later, then. Countess Olenska is expecting us at half-pastfive.
ARCHER=>What?
TED=>Oh, didn't I tell you. Annie made me swear to do three things in Paris. Get herthe score of the last Debussy songs. Go to the Grand Guignol. And see MadameOlenska. You know she was awfully good to Annie when Mr. Beaufort sent her over tothe Sorbonne. Wasn't the Countess friendly with Mr. Beaufort's first wife orsomething? I think Mrs. Beaufort said that she was. In any case, I called theCountess this morning and introduced myself as her cousin and. . .
ARCHER=>You told her I was here?
TED=>Of course. Why not? She sounds lovely. Was she?
ARCHER=>Lovely? I don't know. She was different.
NARRATOR=>Whenever he thought of Ellen Olenska, it had been abstractly, serenely, like animaginary loved one in a book or picture. She had become the complete vision of allthat he had missed.
ARCHER=>But I'm only fifty-seven.
TED=>Did Mr. Beaufort really have such a bad time of it, when he wanted to remarry? Noone wanted to give him an inch.
ARCHER=>Perhaps because he had already taken so much.
TED=>If anyone remembers anymore. Or cares.
ARCHER=>Well, he and Annie Ring did have a lovely daughter. You're very lucky.
TED=>We're very lucky, you mean.
ARCHER=>Yes, that's what I mean.
TED=>So considering how that all turned out. . . and considering all the time that's goneby. . . I don't see how you can resist.
ARCHER=>Well, I did have some resistance at first to your marriage, I've told you that. . .
TED=>No, I mean resist seeing the woman you almost threw everything over for. Only youdidn't.
ARCHER=>I didn't.
TED=>No. But mother said. . .
ARCHER=>Your mother?
TED=>Yes. The day before she died. She asked to see me alone, remember? She said sheknew we were safe with you, and always would be. Because once, when she asked youto, you gave up the thing you wanted most.
ARCHER=>She never asked me.
NARRATOR=>After a little while he did not regret Ted's indiscretion. It seemed to take aniron band from his heart to know that, after all, someone had guessed and pitied. . . And that it should have been his wife moved him inexpressibly.
TED=>The porter says it's the fifth floor. It must be the one with the awnings.
TED=>It's nearly six.
ARCHER=>I think I'll sit a moment.
TED=>Do you mean you won't come?
TED=>You really won't come at all?
ARCHER=>I don't know.
TED=>She won't understand.
ARCHER=>Go on, son. Maybe I'll follow you.
TED=>But what will I tell her?
ARCHER=>Don't you always have something to say?
TED=>I'll tell her you're old-fashioned and you insist on walking up five flights insteadof taking the elevator.
ARCHER=>Just say I'm old-fashioned. That should be enough.
