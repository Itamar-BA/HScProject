OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
POLICEMAN=>Get out of the way! Clear the street!
POLICEMAN=>Clear the street! Can't you hear -- Old Man? There's a race going on...
JUDD=>All right.
POLICEMAN=>Watch out, Old Man!
HECK=>You got a good horse, cowboy. But not good enough. I'll have that dollar.
HANK=>I'm beginning to figure these races smell pretty bad. That thing never loses and it's been runnin' since breakfast.
HECK=>You had your chance.
HANK=>Not an even-money chance. I suspect as how that animal could run all day without raisin' a thirst.
HECK=>All day -- and all night.
HANK=>That's how it is?
HECK=>That's how it is -- now pay up!
HANK=>Let's say I'm a poor loser -- you want the dollar -- you come after it.
OREGON KID=>All you got to do is hit the can and you win the money. You miss -- I've got to hit it -- or I lose! Squeeze the trigger, don't jerk it. Keep your elbow close to your body.
WES=>Forget the sermon and turn her loose.
OREGON KID=>Tell you what I'm going to do. I'll hit it twice, to your once, that is, if you hit it -- but I don't believe you can or you will -- my grandaddy would say shootin' against you is like sneakin' licorice whips from a baby girl. Why don't you just forget it -- throw away that pistol and pick up a plow -- save my conscience and your money?
OREGON KID=>Don't hurry your shots, son.
OREGON KID=>My boy, I keep telling you...
OREGON KID=>But you don't seem to listen. Care to try again...
WES=>I'll be back.
HECK=>I'm fed up with it, Gil -- racing that double humped water tank is bad enough -- -- but knockin' somebody down for a slim dollar only to give most of it away is poor rations for Mrs. Longtree's first born.
OREGON KID=>I'll settle up tonight.
JAKE=>Now.
JAKE=>Sweeten it, gunfighter, or you're through.
OREGON KID=>Don't say anything more, you mean mouthed, two bit, chicken hearted son -- of greed and envy. Just get out.
HECK=>You sure told that Jake what he could do.
OREGON KID=>And how can man die better, Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, Or the temples of his gods -- It was a poor excuse for a job anyway, Heck -- time I was movin' on. You want big money you go where the big money is.
HECK=>I'm going with you.
OREGON KID=>All right -- get the horses.
JUDD=>If it's all right with you, mister, I would surely like to make a ten cent bet?
OREGON KID=>A whole dime? You are a plunger, sir.
JUDD=>Well, you see, I'm not just altogether sure I could hit a movin' target without using buckshot. I used to be fair to middlin' with a shotgun. If the bird was movin' slow and not too far away. But, them tin cans move too fast -- I just don't see how you manage.
OREGON KID=>Well, I'll be damed!
JUDD=>How are you, Gil?
OREGON KID=>No great complaints. How long's it been? Lordy, I'd hate to say.
JUDD=>Quite some time.
OREGON KID=>Where you been all these years?
JUDD=>Here and there. Nice little enterprise you've got.
OREGON KID=>Well, Steve, it's easier than punching cows. And it pays off with free drinks every time I walk into a saloon -- Would it surprise you to know The Oregon Kid is the envy of every small- minded ribbon clerk and shirttail towhead from here to Pocatello?
JUDD=>Why not, with all these single-handed exploits -- tell me, Gil, who was 'the Omaha Gang' -- I don't recollect ever hearing about them fellows. Hondo and Monterey and Flagstaff -- we worked them places -- but Dodge City and Wichita -- you spend some time with the Earp brothers, Gil?
OREGON KID=>Got to allow for a little exaggeration. That's part of playing this game.
JUDD=>Not much of a game.
OREGON KID=>Well, no danger of getting rich, but I do all right when you consider I never lose.
JUDD=>A blind man couldn't miss, shooting buckshot.
OREGON KID=>Must be something important to bring you here -- looks to me like you been riding a long time -- and not getting very far.
JUDD=>Job.
OREGON KID=>A 'job'? You mean to tell me you're still at it? Federal Marshal?
JUDD=>Working for the Bank.
OREGON KID=>A bank guard?
JUDD=>I'm transporting gold. From a mining camp up on top down here to the bank... Gold bullion -- in the neighborhood of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, was the way the letter put it.
OREGON KID=>A quarter of a million.
JUDD=>I'll need some help. Can you recommend anyone?
OREGON KID=>I'll give it some thought.
JUDD=>Do that, will you? And let me know.
OREGON KID=>I will, Steve, I surely will.
HECK=>What do you figure we're going to do.
OREGON KID=>Hmmm?
HECK=>Food, clothing and shelter -- What have you got in mind?
OREGON KID=>Champagne, kid -- and only the best -- about $250,000 dollars worth.
ABNER=>Yes.
JUDD=>I'd like to see Mr. Samson, please.
ABNER=>He's busy. What about?
JUDD=>The name is Judd. Stephen Judd.
ABNER=>Oh. Just one moment.
ABNER=>Excuse me, sir. Mr. Judd is here.
ABNER=>Mr. Samson will see you --
JUDD=>Good afternoon.
SAMSON=>I'm Luther Samson, Mr. Judd. And this is Abner, my son -- our vice president.
SAMSON=>Somehow, I pictured you as being a younger man.
JUDD=>I used to be. We all used to be.
SAMSON=>Yes, of course.
ABNER=>Mr. Judd, we're more than familiar with your reputation. But it was made many years ago and we're dealing in the present, not the past...
JUDD=>Thank you. What's the problem, gentlemen?
SAMSON=>The Coarse Gold Strike is on the crest of the Sierras. Only one trail in and out. Six miners have been killed trying to bring their gold down here. Killed and robbed, of course. Weeks ago we petitioned for a Federal Marshal. And received nothing.
ABNER=>The only law up there is too drunk to hit the ground with his hat.
SAMSON=>The man we send up there must be completely reliable and not just from the standpoint of honesty.
ABNER=>We're speaking of gold, Mr. Judd. -- Twenty thousand dollars worth.
JUDD=>Twenty thousand? From your letter I expected...
ABNER=>Our original estimate was... overly enthusiastic. The strike is not a mother lode -- but it is productive. Slow but steady.
SAMSON=>The day of the Forty-niner is past, Mr. Judd. The day of the steady businessman has arrived.
JUDD=>My usual fee is twenty dollars a day. I'll have to charge you forty.
ABNER=>Forty dollars a day?
SAMSON=>Just what does that...?
JUDD=>Two other men. Four days is a long time to go without sleep.
SAMSON=>The question is --
JUDD=>The question is, can I do it? Can't answer that by talking. Only by doing it. If you want to talk about it, go ahead. I'll read the contract.
JUDD=>In private, if you please.
SAMSON=>You can go in there.
JUDD=>Contract's all right. How about me? Any doubts? If not, I'll borrow your pen, sir.
HECK=>That old man? He don't look like much to me.
GIL=>Son, I wore a star with "that old man" for six years -- I was his deputy most of the time -- once he was mine. Don't ever play him short!
HECK=>I just don't figure him to be any trouble.
GIL=>I hope you're right, boy -- I surely hope you're right. I'll beard the lion -- you demonstrate how impressed you are -- and do it with your mouth shut!
DOLLY=>Hello Heck -- Mr. Westrum.
GIL=>Evening, honey.
DOLLY=>Stop it!
HECK=>What did I do?
DOLLY=>Never mind what you did. Don't do it in here!
HECK=>All righty. How about down at the livery stable in an hour? Can you get away?
DOLLY=>I think so.
GIL=>Too bad, because Heck won't be there.
HECK=>Why not?
GIL=>Because if I can't, you won't.
GIL=>Still keeping records, eh?
JUDD=>You know me. Creature of habit.
GIL=>Here's someone else wants to know you. My partner, Heck Longtree. You'd blush to hear the way he admires you.
JUDD=>How do you do?
HECK=>Howdy.
JUDD=>Have a chair. Kind of showing your age, aren't you?
GIL=>Huh?
JUDD=>Interfering with a young man's love life.
GIL=>He's got more important things on his mind. Haven't you? Yes, sir, and so have I. Been considering your problem. Think I can solve half of it. Maybe the whole thing. I know a fellow who's got an overwhelming hankering for a little old time activity.
JUDD=>It seems to me a man would have to be pretty hard up to risk his life for ten dollars a day.
HECK=>Ten dollars a day --?
GIL=>Not hard up. Just fed up. Out-shooting the rubes for nickels and dimes... takes all the free drinks I can get to put me to sleep at night. My partner here feels the same way.
JUDD=>Don't know as I'd want to hire a boy.
HECK=>Boy? What do you --
GIL=>Steve, this boy's a good deal less than green.
JUDD=>Couldn't have too much behind him.
GIL=>That's where you're wrong. He's been dogging after me for better than three years.
JUDD=>Pretty. Too bad he don't keep it clean.
JUDD=>Boys nowadays. No pride. No self- respect. Plenty of gall, but no sand. Take that race today --
HECK=>What about those races?
JUDD=>At that distance, no horse in the world can beat a camel.
HECK=>You calling me a cheat?
HANK=>If he don't, I surely will.
GIL=>Go get 'em, tiger, you're doin' fine.
GIL=>What do you think?
DOLLY=>I think he's wonderful.
JUDD=>He'll do. He'll do just fine.
JUDD=>Sorry about the damage.
GIL=>Send the bill to the bank, honey -- Stephen Judd's account.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
JUDD=>What's the trouble, Partner? Have you got the rheumatism?
GIL=>I'm used to working with my brain, not my butt.
HECK=>You think you can talk him into it?
GIL=>One way or another.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
JOSHUA=>Elsa!
JOSHUA=>-- don't have room in the house, but I've no objection if you want to spend the night in the barn.
JUDD=>Much obliged. If you could spare us a few fresh eggs, be glad to pay for them.
JOSHUA=>One you can have as the Lord's bounty is not for sale. Any more are a dollar each.
HECK=>A dollar each? How in the world do those short-legged chickens lay eggs so high?
JOSHUA=>Levity in the young --
JOSHUA=>My daughter, Elsa.
JUDD=>How do you do?
GIL=>Pleased to meet you.
HECK=>Likewise.
JOSHUA=>Go start supper. And change that dress.
ELSA=>Change it? What for?
JOSHUA=>For the good reason I told you to. Did you hear what I said?
HECK=>I think it's a real pretty dress.
ELSA=>Thank you.
HECK=>Shouldn't I have said that?
GIL=>You'll have to forgive the young man. I've tried to teach him that silence is golden, but he's a slow learner.
JOSHUA=>'Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it.' Put your horses in the corral yonder. Supper'll be ready in an hour -- no charge -- 'The Lord's bounty --
GIL=>-- is not for sale.'
JUDD=>Thank you, sir.
HECK=>Think of all that going to waste up here.
GIL=>Like the fellow said, gold is where you find it.
JUDD=>And if it isn't yours don't covet it.
GIL=>Don't worry, boy, the Lord's bounty may not be for sale -- but the Devil's is -- if you can pay the price.
JOSHUA=>Heavenly Father, we thank Thee for the food on this table. Teach Thy children to be grateful for Thy goodness, to walk in Thy path, that they may not suffer Thy wrath and Thy vengeance.
JOSHUA=>Bless us, Oh Lord, and these our guests, and forgive them the mercenary desires that brought them here. Amen.
GIL=>I thank you, Mr. Knudsen, for entering a plea in our behalf. But what's this about mercenary desires?
JOSHUA=>On your way to Coarse Gold, be'n't you?
GIL=>Yes.
JOSHUA=>Those that travel there do so for one reason only. To traffic in gold. Which to possess is to live in fear; to desire, to live in sorrow.
JUDD=>We're not trafficking, sir. Merely transporting.
JOSHUA=>It says in the Book, 'Gold is a stumbling block unto them that sacrifice to it, and every fool shall be taken therewith.'
JUDD=>'A good man is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold' -- Proverbs, Chapter 22.
JOSHUA=>'Into the land of trouble and anguish come the old lions and they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses to a people that shall not profit them'. Isaiah, Chapter 30, verse 6.
JOSHUA=>That mining camp is a sinkhole of depravity, a place of shame and sin.
HECK=>Well, like the fellow said, sin is where you find it.
ELSA=>According to my father, everyplace outside this farm is a place of sin.
JOSHUA=>That will do.
ELSA=>You don't have to preach at everybody.
JOSHUA=>That will do!
GIL=>You cook a lovely ham hock, Miss Knudsen. Just lovely. Appetite -- Chapter One.
HECK=>Give me a towel and I'll dry.
ELSA=>You hadn't better. Thanks all the same.
HECK=>Must be pretty lonely, living up here.
ELSA=>Sometimes I get to thinking there's no one left in the world but my father and me.
HECK=>It's a crime, you being stuck here on this old stump ranch. Girl like you, you ought to be living in the city. San Francisco, say.
ELSA=>You've been there?
HECK=>Plenty of times.
ELSA=>I've never been anywhere. He won't even take me to Hornitos when he goes after supplies. Says the men would stare at me.
HECK=>Supposing, on the way back, I was to pick you up? Take you to San Francisco... Denver... Chicago even.
JOSHUA'S VOICE=>Elsa! Who you talking to in there?
ELSA=>To myself. You'd better go.
HECK=>Meet you outside later.
ELSA=>I can't.
HECK=>I'll wait by the corral.
JUDD=>That boy you trained personally shows a substantial lack of judgment.
GIL=>Kind of showing your age, aren't you? Interfering with a young man's love life?
JUDD=>I'm not paying him ten dollars a day to go mooning after a girl whose father is getting ready to hind end him with a load of buckshot.
GIL=>Know who she reminds me of? Sara Truesdale.
JUDD=>There's no resemblance at all.
GIL=>Oh, maybe not in the features. But the way she smiles... And there's the same look in her eyes when you're talking. The kind of look that makes you feel you've said something real important.
JUDD=>Wonder if I can get these fixed in Coarse Gold.
GIL=>Probably not. You and Sara always looked so right together. Course, can't say I blamed her for not marrying you -- Forgetting the lousy money we made, what woman wants to sit around waitin' for her husband to be brought home with his head shot off?
JUDD=>That was all a long time ago.
GIL=>Guess losing Sara's what you might call a hazard of our profession. That rancher she married -- Stacey? Hear he's doing fine up in Idaho. Got a big ranch there. Raises blooded horses. And children, too, I hear.
JUDD=>Grandchildren now -- three of them.
GIL=>That so, Steve?
JUDD=>Yep, that's right. If my sleeping bothers you, don't bother to let me know.
GIL=>Sorry.
HECK=>You surely took your time.
ELSA=>Shh. I shouldn't be here at all.
HECK=>Why, the night air bother you? If it does, we can climb up to the hayloft.
ELSA=>I love the night air. The thing is, I'm what you might call engaged.
HECK=>Sure you are.
ELSA=>It's the truth. His name is Billy Hammond. He asked me to marry him. Several times. And I said I probably would. You'll see him in Coarse Gold. He's a miner there. And doing very well.
HECK=>Well, if he's in Coarse Gold and you're here, I don't see any harm in us --
JOSHUA=>You! Get in the barn and stay there. And you -- go to the house!
JUDD=>'The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit; and him that is abhorred by the Lord shall fall therein -- '
JOSHUA=>Will you never learn any decency?
ELSA=>We were only going to talk. Talk.
JOSHUA=>The likes of him don't stop at talking.
ELSA=>The likes of him. Every man I meet becomes 'the likes of him'.
JOSHUA=>He's no good. I can see it in his face.
ELSA=>That's all you see in anyone. Billy Hammond came here twice. You said he was evil -- sinful.
JOSHUA=>I'm your father. I've got to keep the dirt away. Protect you from the wrong kind of men.
ELSA=>That means everyone, doesn't it? Every single man in the world is the wrong kind of man. Except you.
ELSA=>I promised next time you hit me, you'd be sorry for it.
JOSHUA=>For my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.
JOSHUA=>Go to bed.
JOSHUA=>'Receive my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies.'
JUDD=>In about thirty years you'll like the feel of it, too.
JUDD=>Pick it up. These mountains don't need your trash.
GIL=>Dandy pair of boots you got here.
JUDD=>Juan Fernandez made these for me in San Antone -- made them special -- had a hell of a time convincing him to put that hole in -- fine craftsman, Juan -- But he never understood the principle of ventilation.
GIL=>I remember Juan -- always felt the boot should cover the foot.
JUDD=>Short-sighted.
GIL=>Remember old Doc Franklin, the fancy boots he wore? With the flaps over the toes? Had them made, in Boston. Old Doc. Know what happened to him?
JUDD=>Heard he died.
GIL=>That's right. It would've touched your heart to see the funeral. Old Doc. Gave thirty years of his life to make the West safe for decent people. You'd've wept to see the way they turned out to pay tribute to him. All three of them. The mortician, the grave digger and me.
JUDD=>When I'm buried, I won't much care who comes to the funeral.
GIL=>I was commenting on the fairest flower that grows within the human heart... gratitude.
JUDD=>Only gratitude I expect is my paycheck. Twenty dollars worth.
GIL=>That satisfies you?
JUDD=>I guess it's all I can hope for.
GIL=>Is it?
JUDD=>According to the terms of my contract, it is. Let's get moving.
HECK=>You're just wasting your breath. He don't even know what you're talking about.
GIL=>He will. In time.
HECK=>When we're ready, let's just bend a gun barrel over his head and take off with the gold.
GIL=>In the first place, boy, you couldn't get close enough to Steve Judd to saddle his horse.
HECK=>That old man --? Well, you could --
GIL=>Yes, I could -- but I won't. Unless I have to.
GIL=>I hope Heaven forgives us for earning this easy money.
JUDD=>I seem to remember a man saying he hankered for some old-time activity.
GIL=>I'd like to see some old time mountains. As I recall, they were a lot easier to get around in.
JUDD=>You do a lot of complaining in your old age.
GIL=>I got something to complain about. You're earning twice as much for the same risk. Plus possessing all the other rewards you've gathered during your years of loyal service. A bluegrass thoroughbred, silver mounted saddle, magnificent wardrobe. What more could a man expect -- hope for?
JUDD=>You forgot to mention my two dollar watch.
HECK=>Waste of breath.
JUDD=>What more could a man expect? I got to thinkin' about that one time -- well, sir, I keep records. When I became a lawman, the world lost a first-class bookkeeper. So, to pass the time one day, I sort of calculated, what it's worth to get shot at. Figured it about a hundred dollars a shot.
GIL=>You would have earned quite a sum by now.
JUDD=>Getting hit, I figure that's worth anywhere from a thousand on up.
GIL=>That's three thousand I know you got coming.
JUDD=>Four brings it up to date. Then tally up all the fights, bush-whackings, cold camps and the like... that time in Lincoln County -- five weeks in the hospital, six months out of work. Add it all up, I'd say I was owed about all the gold we could carry out of these mountains... That's something to hope for.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
HECK=>My luck has surely turned --
ELSA=>Do you mind if I keep you company on the trip?
HECK=>I don't mind.
JUDD=>I do.
GIL=>I'll second that. You've run away, haven't you? Well, my advice to you, honey, is turn that horse around and ride back home where you belong.
ELSA=>I'm not going back to my father -- I'm going to Coarse Gold to marry Billy Hammond.
HECK=>What do you want to do a foolish thing like that for?
ELSA=>That is my affair.
JUDD=>She's right, Heck. Our business is transporting gold. Not girls.
ELSA=>Thank you for paying back our hospitality. Those lovely ham hocks, and everything.
GIL=>I'm a strong believer in young love and gratitude, but --
ELSA=>Not strong enough to let me ride with you --? I'll ride by myself.
JUDD=>We can get in another three or four miles before it gets dark.
GIL=>Right. Got to cover ground. Do you have a gun?
ELSA=>No, I don't have a gun...
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
GIL=>Too bad. This is mountain lion country, if I've ever seen any. Well, build a good fire. Chances are it'll scare them off.
HECK=>You both go on ahead... I couldn't sleep tonight with the thought of Elsa out here all by herself... I'll stay with her and meet you in Coarse Gold... Go ahead.
GIL=>Those mountain lions, some don't scare so easy.
JUDD=>Come along.
JUDD=>Do you remember Old Man Teaford?
JUDD=>All night, Logan.
GIL=>Oh, yeah... Way up, Logan.
GIL=>That was a long time ago.
HECK=>You know, the way you do your hair, it looks real nice.
ELSA=>Think so? -- Pa had me cut it short.
HECK=>Sort of fits in with the shape of your head when you see it from the side. Like that... Most girls don't have the first idea how to wear their hair.
ELSA=>I guess you're an authority on what most girls do.
HECK=>I've studied the subject. Not just what they do, but why. Take this getting married. You think that's a good idea?
ELSA=>If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
HECK=>My guess is, you're doing it to get away from your Pa. Maybe to get even.
ELSA=>I guess your guess is as good as anybody's.
HECK=>If it's wrong, how come you run away?
ELSA=>Because my father doesn't want me to get married. Oh, he says he does. If I can find a decent young man. But nobody's decent, according to him. You included. Said you were no good. Said the likes of you don't stop at talking.
HECK=>Well, he might have a point there. Don't move!
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
GIL=>Oh my -- oh my.
JUDD=>When I questioned you about the boy, I should've gone a bit deeper into the subject of character. Hope that's a mistake I won't live to regret.
GIL=>A bird in the hand --
JUDD=>What are you trying to say, Gil?
GIL=>Good fight. I enjoyed it.
GIL=>"That old man?"
HECK=>That old man is about half rough.
GIL=>You learned a lesson.
HECK=>I surely did.
GIL=>Got room for another?
HECK=>Let her fly.
GIL=>We're not here for romance -- do you understand me, Son?
HECK=>I understand.
ELSA=>I hope Mr. Judd didn't hurt you too bad.
ELSA=>I guess it's kinda my fault...
HECK=>What do you mean, kinda?
ELSA=>I acted silly. I'm sorry. I do like you...
HECK=>Save the sugar talk for your Billy- boy. I don't need it.
ELSA=>I guess not. What you need is the kind of a girl who'd go off with you to San Francisco or Denver...
HECK=>That's right. And there's plenty of them.
ELSA=>I changed my mind. You got just what you deserve.
HECK=>You got something to say?
GIL=>No, I think she about covered everything.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
GIL=>Lovely place. A beauty spot of nature -- a garden of Eden for the sore in heart and short of cash.
JUDD=>We didn't come here to admire the scenery.
GIL=>The High Sierra Crochet and Garden Society seem to be having their weekly meeting.
JUDD=>Pass the word around we're in camp and ready for business. Find out where the Hammond claim is and take -- -- her there.
HECK=>Why me?
GIL=>Because Steve and I are going to be busy weighing gold dust.
JUDD=>It's not too late to change your mind...
ELSA=>I came to be married and that's what I'm going to be -- married!
JUDD=>Good luck, then.
GIL=>All the happiness in the world.
GIL=>This seems to be the place to find it.
HECK=>You might be in for a surprise... How do you know Billy-boy still wants to marry you --?
ELSA=>What do you care?
HECK=>I don't!
HECK=>This the Hammond claim?
ELDER=>Who wants to know?
HECK=>Me. I'm looking for Billy Hammond.
ELSA=>Billy!
JIMMY=>Must be the girl he's been going down the mountain to see.
ELDER=>I'll say one thing, she's sure worth the trip.
JIMMY=>Wish I'd got there first. Looks like a warm one.
BILLY=>Where's your Pa?
ELSA=>Back home, where do you think?
BILLY=>You run away, just to see me?
ELSA=>See you? Don't you remember what you said?
BILLY=>I said a lot of things.
ELSA=>I mean about us. I brought my mother's wedding dress. If you still want to.
BILLY=>Hear that? Prettiest girl in California, and she says, if I want to.
SYLVUS=>If he don't, you got four others to choose from.
ELDER=>Girl like you deserves the pick of the litter. So there's no rush about making up your mind.
BILLY=>Don't listen to them. We're getting married tonight.
ELSA=>I guess that'll be all, Mr. Longtree.
BILLY=>Just who is Mr. Longtree?
ELSA=>I rode up with him from the farm.
BILLY=>That's a couple of days on the trail, ain't it?
HECK=>That's right -- and a coupla nights.
ELSA=>There were two other men with us from the bank, in Hornitos. Besides, Mr. Longtree was a perfect gentleman.
SYLVUS=>How come? Something wrong with him?
BILLY=>I don't think I ever met a perfect gentleman before. I am truly honored Mr. Longtree. Truly.
BILLY=>Sylvus, Jimmy -- come over here. I want you to meet my woman. Elder -- come here.
BILLY=>That's Jimmy. He's our youngest. Next is Sylvus, he's our cook -- as you can see. And that there's Elder -- he's head of the family. Well, boys -- say hello to the gal.
JIMMY=>How do...
BILLY=>Now I want you to meet my favorite brother. Henry -- you come on down and meet my gal.
HENRY=>What he meant to say was the richest.
BILLY=>Henry's our banker.
BILLY=>Come on, Honey. I'll show you my tent.
GIL=>Looks like you've got a pretty good claim.
KATE=>It's a gold mine, honey. Come on over and take a look.
GIL=>Find Billy Hammond?
HECK=>Yeah.
JUDD=>What's he like?
HECK=>What difference does it make? She wanted him, now she's got him.
GIL=>Count your blessings, brother. 6 pounds, 8 ounces, 3 pennyweight, 14 grains, total.
JUDD=>6 pounds, 8 ounces, 3 pennyweight, 14 grains.
JIMMY=>Damn the both of you, I don't want to be shaved.
HENRY=>Well, you're gonna be, whether you like it or not.
ELDER=>You been running around with peach fuzz long enough. We want that girl to know she's marrying into a family of men.
ELDER=>If you don't stop wiggling you'll likely lose an ear.
SYLVUS=>Nossir. Don't see no reason to move out, just 'cause you're honeymoonin' in here.
BILLY=>I don't have time to explain it.
SYLVUS=>Well, I ain't goin'.
BILLY=>You just did.
SYLVUS=>You know, I think Billy's getting small minded about that woman.
ELSA=>I've got to clean up in here.
BILLY=>Plenty of time for that later.
ELSA=>No, I want to do it now. The place is filthy and -- Let go, Billy. Let me go!
BILLY=>All right. See you later. If you need any help fastening up your wedding dress, just holler.
ELSA=>I can manage.
HENRY=>Well, now he's had his first shave, let's make a complete man out of him. Time for your first drink.
JIMMY=>I don't want a drink.
ELDER=>It ain't so much what you want. It's what your brothers tell you to do.
JIMMY=>Damn you! Damn you!
BILLY=>You plan to bathe, Henry?
HENRY=>No, sir.
ELDER=>You won't clean up for Billy's wedding?
HENRY=>No sirree. Didn't wash when Cousin was wed back home... Didn't seem to bother his bride none.
BILLY=>There'll be none of that.
HENRY=>None of what?
HENRY=>You're right. Billy's becomin' small minded about that female.
SYLVUS=>Small minded and feisty.
ELDER=>A few drinks under his belt, he'll change his mind. Liquor has a softening effect on Billy.
BILLY=>Hate to get married with one of my brothers smellin' bad enough to gag a dog off a Gut Wagon.
ELDER=>That's so. Want that sweet little girl to think we're less than quality?
HENRY=>After tonight she won't be able to think enough about...
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
THE BROTHERS=>On that bright and shining morning When the dead Christ shall rise When the morn shall break eternal bright and fair And the saved of earth shall gather Over on the other shore When the roll is called up yonder We'll be there. When the roll is called up yonder When the roll is called up yonder When the roll is called up yonder We'll be there. Oh, the Hammond Boys are comin' With a maiden young and fair And our Billy's got that love-light in his eyes Old Tolliver's awaitin' with a prayer book in his hand To tie the knot that binds them till they die.
KATE=>Stand up, Judge -- here comes the bride.
BILLY=>Here she is, my bride-to-be. Elsa, this is Judge Tolliver. And Kate, your bridesmaid.
KATE=>Welcome to Kate's Place.
JUDGE=>Pleased to make your acquaintance, my dear.
BILLY=>I want you to meet Belle, Rose, Candy and Sam.
BELLE=>We're your flower girls, Honey.
KATE=>You look beautiful -- just beautiful. Aren't they beautiful, Elsa?
KATE=>Let her go, Charlie.
KATE AND GIRLS=>For she's a jolly good fellow She's a jolly good fellow For she's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny.
MINERS AND BROTHERS=>Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny For she's a jolly good fellow She's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny.
KATE=>All right, girls, take care of your customers. Drinks are on the house. Now, child, sit down, be easy -- and we'll all of us have a little drinkie before the formalities.
KATE=>Drink up, Honey -- go ahead. Don't be afraid.
GIL=>All in all, I'd say it's been a reasonably productive day. Although it's a little closer to eleven than 250 thousand.
JUDD=>Fortunes of war.
GIL=>Hardly worth it.
JUDD=>It all depends on where you stand.
GIL=>I guess that's right. To a poor man 11 thousand is just as far away as 250 thousand.
JUDD=>Where you going?
HECK=>Out for some fresh air. Any objection?
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
JUDGE TOLLIVER=>We are gathered here in the high mountains, and in the presence of this august company, to join together this man and this woman in matrimony... Now matrimony is an honorable estate, instituted, blessed, and commended and commented on by almost everybody. I am not a man of the Cloth, and this is not a religious ceremony. It is a Civil marriage. But none-theless, it should not be entered into unadvisedly, but reverently and soberly... You know, a good marriage has a kind of simple glory about it. A good marriage is a rare animal, hard to find -- almost impossible to keep... I don't know -- you see... Well, people change. It's important for you to know at the beginning that people change. You see, the real glory of marriage don't come at the beginning. It comes later and it's hard work.
MINER=>I wish they'd liven things up a bit. I'm getting awfully dry.
JUDGE TOLLIVER=>Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? And promise that you will perform unto her all the duties that a husband owes his wife -- until God, by death, shall separate you?
BILLY=>I do.
JUDGE TOLLIVER=>And do you -- What did you say your name was?
ELSA=>Elsa Knudsen.
JUDGE=>And do you, Elsa, take this man to be your lawful, wedded husband until death shall separate you?
ELSA=>I do.
JUDGE=>Do you have a ring?
JUDGE TOLLIVER=>Then by the 'thority vested in me I pr'nounce you man and wife.
KATE=>All right, girls -- change your clothes.
JUDD=>No use standing here tormenting yourself, Son. Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
BILLY=>Let's get out of here.
BILLY=>Tonight's sure making a man out of Jimmy.
ELSA=>Don't leave me.
JUDD=>I wish I'd known more about those brothers.
HECK=>Too late now -- she's married.
GIL=>Glad they didn't invite me to the ceremony. I always cry at weddings.
HECK=>You know, Mr. Westrum, the more I am around you the more I can do without your sense of humor.
JUDD=>You stay here!
GIL=>Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
JUDD=>Let her go.
BILLY=>Where you taking my wife?
JUDD=>She'll stay the night with us, and go back to her father tomorrow.
BILLY=>Like hell she will.
ELDER=>You can't take a wife away from her husband.
JUDGE=>Clear case of breaking and entering.
ELDER=>Elsa's legally married to Billy. Right, Judge?
JUDGE=>I now pr'nounce you man 'n wife -- and, don't you forget it.
JUDD=>Come along, Elsa.
ELDER=>You won't leave this camp with her. I can promise you that.
JUDD=>The marriage didn't work out. We'll take her with us -- back to her father.
GIL=>We've got our hands full already.
JUDD=>I don't like it any better than you do, but we can't leave her here.
ELSA=>Thanks very much. I'll pay you back.
HECK=>Forget it.
ELSA=>I didn't thank you for last night, either.
HECK=>Forget that, too. Too big, huh?
JUDD=>-- We will abide by the court's decision if you will --
ELSA=>What are they doing there?
HECK=>Don't know. Don't be scared. Everything will be all right.
HECK=>What's wrong?
JUDD=>Billy Hammond wants Elsa. He's called a Miners' Court to decide the issue.
HECK=>Miners' Court?
JUDD=>That's the law, places like this --
HECK=>Who says?
GIL=>They do. And there's a lot more of them than there are of us. Billy's very sorry about last night. Swears nothing like it will ever happen again. I believe him.
HECK=>I wouldn't believe Billy-boy --
ELSA=>I don't want to go back to him.
JUDD=>They'll take your wishes into consideration. Problem is, you were legally married by the local Judge, of your own free will.
ELSA=>Please, you can't let them take me back. You can't!
GIL=>We'll do the best we can. But whatever they decide, that will have to be it.
HECK=>No, that don't have to be it. She's not going back to him. She's going with us.
GIL=>She stays here!... We're packin' gold with us, not petticoats.
HECK=>To hell with the gold! If she stays, I stay.
JUDD=>Let's hope the Court decides that she can go. Otherwise we're going to be a little short-handed.
JUDGE=>Much obliged.
GIL=>Not at all. Have another?
JUDGE=>Don't mind if I do.
JUDGE=>Thank you, sir. What can I do for you?
GIL=>Clear up a little technicality, if you will. They're holding a Miners' Court. About that marriage last night -- they'll want to know if it was legal.
JUDGE=>Of course it was legal!
GIL=>Well, I believe that. But the Court may want proof. In the form of a license. To perform marriages. You got one?
JUDGE=>See for yourself.
GIL=>Signed by the Governor of California. Yes sir, there's no question at all about the legality of this document. Now Judge, when you testify at that Miners' Court I'm going to ask you one question: 'Do you possess a license to marry people in California?' And you're going to answer, 'No'. Am I clear?
JUDGE=>But that's a lie.
GIL=>No, it isn't. You don't possess it. I do.
JUDGE=>Now, hold on, Mister --
GIL=>Listen to me, you fat-gutted soak -- you're going to do as you're told -- understand? Do you recall the question I'm going to ask you? And what do you answer?
JUDGE=>No.
GIL=>Very good. Let's go.
HECK=>How did you come to figure that Judge was a phony?
GIL=>Might call it a sixth sense. Picked up from years of keeping the peace. A good law enforcement officer can smell a wrong-doer four miles off against a high wind.
JUDD=>Speaking of sixth sense, what did you do with the license?
GIL=>What license?
JUDD=>According to the law, she's still married to Billy Hammond.
GIL=>You and the law. She can get it nullified. Will that satisfy your ironbound code of ethics?
JUDD=>My code satisfies pretty easy, partner. Surprise you to know I was once a law-breaker?
GIL=>Well, bless my stars.
JUDD=>I was about the age of that boy -- skinny as a snake and just about as mean -- ran with the Hole-in-the- wall bunch, gunhappy, looking for trouble -- or a pretty ankle. -- Had the world by the tail so to speak.
JUDD=>Then one night Paul Staniford picked me up. -- He was Sheriff of Madera County then -- there had been a fight and I was drunk -- sicker than a damn dog. Well sir, he dried me out in jail, then we went out back and he proceeded to kick the bitter hell right out of me.
GIL=>That took some doin'...
JUDD=>Not much. You see -- he was right and I was wrong. That makes a difference.
GIL=>Who says so?
JUDD=>Why nobody... That's something you just know -- By the time I was able to walk again I found I'd learned a lesson -- the value of self-respect.
GIL=>What's that worth on the open market?
JUDD=>Nothing to some people -- but a great deal to me. But I lost it -- These last years the only work I could get was in places like Kate's back there... bartender, stick man, bouncer, what have you... Not much to brag on.
JUDD=>Now I've got back a little respect for myself. I hope to keep it... with the help of you... and that boy up ahead.
JUDD=>Pretty country, Gil --
GIL=>Yeah. Partner, you know what's on a poor man's back when he dies? The clothes of pride -- And they're not a bit warmer to him dead than they were when he was alive. What do you want, Steve?
JUDD=>To enter my House justified.
ELSA=>Thank you. Will you stay in town when you get back?
HECK=>I'm not just certain. Why?
GIL=>You were right, Kid. I been wasting my breath. Tonight we move.
HECK=>Tonight? Why so soon?
GIL=>That's the way I see it.
HECK=>I don't know --
GIL=>You don't know what?
HECK=>I started out thinking he was an old mossback. Changed my mind. Kind of hate to turn against him.
GIL=>Are you with me or not?
HECK=>I don't know. What'll happen to Elsa?
GIL=>He'll deliver Elsa to her father. The thing for you to remember is that we made a deal.
HECK=>Yes, sir.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
ELSA=>Care for more, Mr. Judd?
JUDD=>Not for me, thanks.
ELSA=>Heck?
HECK=>No.
ELSA=>I was wondering if I did come to town -- do you think I could find work?
HECK=>No. I don't think so.
GIL=>I'm a collector of well-cooked beans, honey. The boy seems to be off his feed tonight.
JUDD=>I'll stand first guard duty. You take over at midnight. Heck can relieve you at three in the morning.
GIL=>You take guard at three o'clock. I'll wake you.
HECK=>You won't have to.
JUDD=>It all pointed this way. All that talk about old Doc Franklin... grateful citizens... what we've got coming but never got paid...
GIL=>It's the truth, isn't it? Steve?
JUDD=>I knew in my bones what you were aiming for, but I wouldn't believe it. I kept telling myself you were a good man -- you were my friend --
GIL=>This is bank money, not yours.
JUDD=>And what they don't know won't hurt them? Not them. Only me! Take off your gun belt. Toss it over here.
GIL=>What are you going to do?
JUDD=>You always fancied yourself faster than me. Go ahead, draw -- Draw, you damned tinhorn --
JUDD=>That was your second mistake tonight and the last chance you'll ever get from me -- I'm going to put you behind bars, Gil -- and you'll die there.
GIL=>You'll play hell getting it done.
JUDD=>Move!
HECK=>Guess now you're sorry you ran out on Billy-boy, huh? Guess he looks pretty good alongside of me. Why don't you go back to him?
ELSA=>How could you do it?
HECK=>Like your father says, I'm just plain no good. Bad through and through...
JUDD=>Move along, boy.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
GIL=>My, oh, my, would you look at that.
GIL=>You know, I'm glad it's you who has to protect us, not me... No sir, I wouldn't be in your shoes for anything. But tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll have a talk with my partner. Maybe we can be persuaded to help. My arm's pretty rusty, so I wouldn't be much good throwing rocks, but --
JUDD=>Keep away from them horses.
BILLY=>Howdy. You made pure fools out of us -- stealing Tolliver's license. But the Judge says there's a copy of it, on file in Sacramento.
BILLY=>Means you're still my wife -- Come along, Honey. Let's go home.
JUDD=>She stays with us.
HENRY=>If she does, there'll be a lot of fuss and bother.
BILLY=>You're breakin' the law, Mr. Judd -- you know that, don't you?
JUDD=>I know she stays with us.
HENRY=>Looks to me like you people had a little trouble. Looks to me like somebody got their fingers caught in the cookie jar.
BILLY=>You're shorthanded, Old Timer -- but she's all we want. All we want, provided you hand her over now.
JUDD=>You heard me.
BILLY=>We'll get her, sooner or later.
HECK=>Like hell you will!
BILLY=>You better cut a switch, Mr. Longtree -- Don't think you can handle me barehanded --
JUDD=>Heck, will you give me your word to return your gun when we're out of this?
GIL=>What you mean, is when and if.
JUDD=>How about it? Do I have your word?
HECK=>Yes sir -- I reckon you do.
GIL=>I'll go along.
JUDD=>You bet you'll go along. -- Heck, we're movin' into the rocks. Now!
GIL=>Steve --
JUDD=>Shut up and get on your horse.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
BILLY=>Where's Jimmy?
ELDER=>Crazy kid.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
GIL=>What was that I said about a predicament?
ELSA=>What's wrong?
GIL=>Take your pick of five possible answers, all named Hammond. You're showing your age, partner... Back in the old days you'd have checked the rifles before leaving camp.
JUDD=>Don't waste ammunition.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
HENRY=>How much gold do you think he's got?
BILLY=>Enough. (then, as Henry opens
FIRE)=>Careful you don't hit Elsa.
GIL=>Kid, run down to the corner and get me a bottle of beer. And on the way back, stop at the hardware store and pick up a rifle. For Father Time there.
ELSA=>How can you keep joking?
GIL=>I'd gladly cry my heart out, honey, if that would get us a rifle. Because without one, you're looking at three men who aren't going to be around much longer... Steve, cut me loose and give me a gun!
HECK=>Why don't you shut up!
ELSA=>Is that true?
JUDD=>It's just a question of time. We can't do a thing with six-guns. We've got to get a rifle.
GIL=>Why doesn't the mountain go to Mohammed?
JUDD=>Start shooting when I go. Maybe the noise will bother them.
GIL=>If you want to die all that bad, give me a gun and I'll take care of it.
HECK=>With that leg of yours, you'll never even get started.
JUDD=>I told you what to do. Now do it.
ELDER=>Sylvus?... Sylvus!
ELDER=>Looks like he got Sylvus.
BILLY=>Then we're getting out.
ELDER=>Getting out! You've got two brothers dead and you talk about running?
BILLY=>Come on!
GIL=>Think they mean it?
JUDD=>Don't know.
JUDD=>Let's move.
HECK=>Wonder where those other three went?
ELSA=>All I hope is they're not still following us.
GIL=>Calm your fears, honey. My bet is they gave up and went back to Coarse Gold.
JUDD=>Assuming that's so, I'll have your gun back.
JUDD=>Did you hear me, boy?
HECK=>I'm sorry -- I was showing off.
GIL=>What happens when we get back to town?
JUDD=>That's up to the Sheriff.
HECK=>He's turning us in. You know that -- so do I.
GIL=>Ever hear of Folsom Prison, Heck?
HECK=>No.
GIL=>Well, it's new -- and solid rock -- and during the years we spend there, we're going to discuss the events of these past few minutes at great length -- And by the time you get out, you won't like them any better than I do now -- which isn't one hell of a lot. Where do I sleep?
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
JUDD=>Can I count on you to help stand guard duty tonight?
ELSA=>...Yes.
JUDD=>Over there. And I don't want to see you till breakfast.
GIL=>I like my eggs over easy. And bacon just on the crisp side.
GIL=>Cut me loose, Steve.
JUDD=>...Why?
GIL=>Because I don't sleep so good anymore with my hands tied.
HECK=>Night.
ELSA=>Night.
ELSA=>My father says there's only right and wrong, good and evil. Nothing in between. It isn't that simple, is it?
JUDD=>Should be, but isn't.
ELSA=>What's going to happen to him?
JUDD=>The boy? -- I'll testify for him. Odds are, they won't be too hard on him.
ELSA=>Will you testify for Mr. Westrum?
JUDD=>No, I won't.
ELSA=>Why?
JUDD=>Because he was my friend.
HECK=>How come he doesn't tie us down?
GIL=>What for? No place we can go... And he's got the horses -- and he's got the guns. And it wouldn't take long for Steve Judd to find us... Wait a minute, Kid... Just had a thought...
HECK=>Keep it to yourself. I'm fed up with you and your ideas.
GIL=>That's all right. I'm just glad I don't have to live with yours.
ELSA=>Morning.
JUDD=>Where's Gil?
HECK=>When I woke up he was gone. This was on his blanket.
JUDD=>Read it...
HECK=>'Steve -- not that I don't enjoy your company, it's the smell of sour purity I can't stand. Hard to say which of us is the bigger fool. Me, for thinking you had some ordinary human weaknesses. Or you for proving me wrong. Some of that purity smell seems to have rubbed off on Heck. Maybe it's for the best. If the kid had stuck with me he might have become a rich man. And you know what's wrong with having money. You never know who your friends are. So long.'
ELSA=>Why didn't you go with him?
HECK=>Because I didn't see much future in our partnership.
OUT=>Sequence omitted from original script.
JUDD=>Wait here while I look around.
HECK=>The old gent's taking quite a chance.
ELSA=>I don't think so. Neither does he.
HECK=>I never figured it'd work out this way... If you still want to find a job in town, I think Mr. Judd would help.
ELSA=>I was hoping he might.
HECK=>Chances are, I'll be locked up for awhile... I've got no call to bring it up... But... I think -- when I get out...
ELSA=>I'll be there.
JUDD=>Everything's all right. I saw your father. I'll talk to him.
ELSA=>That's strange.
JUDD=>What?
ELSA=>He goes to her grave every day. But always in the morning. Never in the afternoon.
JUDD=>In the ditch!
JUDD=>I walked right into it.
HECK=>I'm going to try for the corral. Cover me.
JUDD=>You can't...
HECK=>Fool stunt. I should have known better.
JUDD=>Amen.
BILLY=>Both down...
ELDER=>Well, the old man won't get up. I nailed him good -- belt high.
ELDER=>I got him.
JUDD=>See you picked up a few articles on your way.
GIL=>This boy left Hammonds scattered all over the mountains.
GIL=>How did you manage to end up in this enviable position?
JUDD=>Main strength and awkwardness.
GIL=>...Bad?
JUDD=>Nearly --
GIL=>What do you think?
JUDD=>Let's meet 'em half way -- head on... Same as always.
GIL=>My sentiments exactly. You Hammonds --!
ELDER=>What do you want, Old Man?
HENRY=>He wants a shovel and six feet of soft ground.
JUDD=>I want to know if you red-necked peckerwoods are too chicken-gutted to finish this thing in the open.
GIL=>Just two old men against all three of you boys...
JUDD=>(winking at Gil --
SHOUTING)=>And if them odds ain't enough for you damned dry-gulchin', Southern trash -- we'll send out the girl.
ELDER=>We're comin'. You hear me, Henry?
HENRY=>I hear. And I'm comin' with!
ELDER=>Hold up! We'll get 'em when they stand.
BILLY=>Ain't you got no sense of family honor!
ELDER=>I just figured...
ELSA=>They're coming.
BILLY=>I'll tell you when.
BILLY=>Start the ball, Old Man.
GIL=>Bad?
JUDD=>How'd we figure... A thousand dollars a shot?
GIL=>Yeah.
JUDD=>Those boys just made me a lot of money. But they put them all in one place.
JUDD=>I don't want them to see this. I want to go it alone.
GIL=>Don't worry about -- about anything. I'll take care of it just like you would have.
JUDD=>Hell, I know that. I always did... You just forgot it for awhile, that's all.
JUDD=>So long -- partner.
GIL=>See you later...
ELSA=>Is he going to be all right?
GIL=>Yeah -- he's goin' to be fine... Come on. Let's get you in the house.
