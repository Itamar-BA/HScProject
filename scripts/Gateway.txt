FOREMAN=>Close call today--
BOB=>Drinks on me.
RECRUITMENT GUY=>The human race thanks you.
DANE=>I don’t know--
VOICE OF GATEWAY=>--to the Gateway Authority!
BOB=>If you say so.
BOB=>Who said that?
KLARA=>Relax your body.
KLARA=>See you around.
VOICE OF GATEWAY=>Gateway was discovered by Sylvester Macklen, a tunnel rat on Venus, who found an operable Heechee spacecraft in a dig, and got inside--
VOICE OF GATEWAY=>Unable to return to Earth --and without food or water-- Macklen signaled the exact location of Gateway by cleverly blowing himself up!
VOICE OF GATEWAY=>The Heechee vessel you see here is the actual ship Macklen used to travel to Gateway!
BOB=>I’ll do that.

BOB=>What’s wrong?
BOB=>Moon or bust?
BOB=>What is this?
VOICE OF GATEWAY=>... and if you see a black hole -- run for your lives!
KLARA=>Is it...a tomb?
PROFESSOR=>On the other hand...it might be an elaborate intelligence test. Maybe the Heechee have retreated to a distant corner of the galaxy, waiting a millennia for a civilization smart enough to complete the ancient puzzle and find them!
PROFESSOR=>Besides... if you’re running from the guards, one can assume your mission produced interesting results.
KLARA=>You believe us?
VOICE OF GATEWAY=>Staring death in the face? Join the Church of the Heechee... it’s later than you think!
BOB=>Cram it, lady!
BOB=>To see a guy.
BOB=>Maybe one way.
BOB=>I’ll take it.
BOB=>Where’s Klara?
EMMA=>You can have this back.
PROFESSOR=>It’s a map. A map!
BOB=>I’ll take it!
FLIGHT DIRECTOR=>The lady can’t stay away.
BOB, KLARA, PROFESSOR=>HEGRAMET , SHIKY, and DANE fill the alien cabin with LAUGHTER, tossing one another CANS OF BEER--
PROFESSOR=>I think we made it--
PROFESSOR=>That thing is a black hole!
DANE=>Four minutes--
