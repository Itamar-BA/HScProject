NARRATOR=>This story is about Howard Beale who was the network news anchorman on UBS-TV --
NARRATOR=>-- in his time, Howard Beale had been a mandarin of television, the grand old man of news, with a HUT rating of 16 and a 28 audience share --
NARRATOR=>-- in 1969, however, he fell to a 22 share, and, by 1972, he was down to a 15 share. In 1973, his wife died, and he was left a childless widower with an 8 rating and a 12 share. He became morose and isolated, began to drink heavily, and, on September 22, 1975, he was fired, effective in two weeks. The news was broken to him by Max Schumacher --
NARRATOR=>-- who was president of the News Division at UBS and an old friend. The two men got properly pissed --
HOWARD=>When was this?
MAX=>1951 --
HOWARD=>I was at CBS with Ed Murrow in 1951. Didn't you join Murrow in 1951? --
MAX=>Must've been 1950 then. I was at NBC. Morning News. Associate producer. I was a kid, twenty-six years old. Anyway, they were building the lower level on the George Washington Bridge, and we were doing a remote there. Except nobody told me! --
MAX=>-- ten after seven in the morning -- I get a call -- "Where the hell are you? -- You're supposed to be on the George Washington Bridge!" -- I jump out of bed -- throw my raincoat over my pajamas -- run down the stairs -- I get out in the street -- I flag a cab -- I jump in -- I say: "Take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge!" --
MAX=>-- the driver turns around -- he says -- don't do it, buddy -- -- he says -- you're a young man -- you got your whole life ahead of you --
HOWARD=>I'm going to kill myself --
MAX=>Oh, shit, Howard --
HOWARD=>I'm going to blow my brains out right on the air, right in the middle of the seven o'clock news.
MAX=>You'll get a hell of a rating, I'll tell you that, a fifty share easy --
HOWARD=>You think so?
MAX=>We could make a series out of it. Suicide of the Week. Hell, why limit ourselves? Execution of the Week -- the Madame Defarge Show! Every Sunday night, bring your knitting and watch somebody get guillotined, hung, electrocuted, gassed. For a logo, we'll have some brute with a black hood over his head. Think of the spin-offs -- Rape of the Week --
HOWARD=>Terrorist of the Week?
MAX=>Beautiful!
HOWARD=>How about Coliseum '74? Every week we throw some Christians to the lions! --
MAX=>Fantastic! The Death Hour! I love it! Suicides, assassinations, mad bombers, Mafia hitmen, murder in the barbershop, human sacrifices in witches' covens, automobile smashups. The Death Hour! A great Sunday night show for the whole family. We'll wipe fucking Disney right off the air --
HOUSEKEEPER=>Are you all right, Mr. Beale?
HOWARD=>I'm fine, thank you, Mrs. Merryman --

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR=>-- what'd you say? --
HOWARD=>-- and since this show was the only thing I had going for me in my life, I have decided to kill myself --
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR=>-- so what'd she say? --
HOWARD=>-- I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to blow my brains out right on this program a week from today --
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>-- ten seconds to commercial --
HOWARD=>-- so tune in next Tuesday. That'll give the public relations people a week to promote the show, and we ought to get a hell of a rating with that, a fifty share easy --
DIRECTOR=>-- and --
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>Listen, did you hear that? --
DIRECTOR=>Take VTA.
AUDIO MAN=>What was that about?
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>Howard just said he was going to blow his brains out next Tuesday.
DIRECTOR=>What're you talking about?
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>Didn't you hear him? He just said --
HARRY HUNTER=>What's wrong now?
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>Howard just said he was going to kill himself next Tuesday.
HARRY HUNTER=>What do you mean Howard just said he was going to kill himself next Tuesday?
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>He was supposed to do a tag on Ron Nesson and into commercial --
AUDIO MAN=>He said tune in next Tuesday, I'm going to shoot myself --
DIRECTOR=>What the hell's going on?

DIRECTOR=>This is the dumbest thing I ever saw! --
HOWARD=>Get the fuck away from me!
OTHER VOICES=>-- cut the show! -- -- get him out of there! -- -- go to standby! -- -- for Chrissakes, you stupid --
MAX=>How the hell do I know? -- Give me the network news control room!
MAX=>Black it out!
SQUAWK BOX=>What the hell happened, Max? --
MAX=>How the hell do I know? I'm going down now!
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR=>Jesus Christ, Mr. Schumacher! --
HARRY HUNTER=>Tom Cabell wants you to call as soon as you come in --
VOICE=>Harry! Joe Sweeney on the phone! --
HARRY HUNTER=>I'm not taking any more calls! Tell them Mr. Schumacher's here! They can talk to him!
MAX=>Howard, you have got to be out of your ever-loving mind. Are you drunk? How much boozing has he been doing today?
VOICES=>-- Mr. Schumacher, Mr. Cabell on the phone! -- -- Mr. Schumacher! Mr. Zangwill for you! -- -- Harry! Mr. Thackeray on Three! --
VOICES=>-- Harry! Thackeray wants to talk to you right now! -- -- Mr. Schumacher! Mr. Gianini wants to talk to you! --
MAX=>You better get hold of Mr. Chaney and Frank Hackett --
HACKETT=>Lou, can't we clear out that downstairs lobby? There must be a hundred people down there, every TV station and wire service in the city. I could barely get in --
LOU=>How'm I going to clear them out, Frank?
HACKETT=>Anything litigable? --
GIANINI=>Not so far --
DONNELLY=>-- We had to abort the show. Ed, what else could we do? We'll make good, don't worry about it --
HACKETT=>Is Nelson in there?
ZANGWILL=>He's talking to Wheeler. So far, over nine hundred fucking phone calls complaining about the foul language --
HACKETT=>Shit --
P.R. MAN=>-- come on, Mickey, what page are you putting it on?! --
CHANEY=>Frank Hackett just walked in --
STEINMAN=>I can't release the tape, Marty, we're still studying it ourselves --
P.R. MAN=>ABC again, wants the tape --
STEINMAN=>Tell him to go fuck himself And that goes for you too, Marty --
HACKETT=>You're off the air as of now.
CHANEY=>He wants to talk to you --
HACKETT=>Who's replacing Beale tomorrow?
MAX=>We're flying up Snowden from Washington.
STEINMAN=>All right, everybody hold it. Let's see how the other networks handled this --
THACKERAY=>The ten o'clock news opened with it --
HACKETT=>Walter's drafted a statement, I haven't seen it yet -- I just got here, John, I was at a dinner party --
MARASH=>An unusual thing happened at one of our sister networks, UBS, this evening --
ROGER GRIMSBY=>Howard Beale, one of television's most esteemed newscasters --
CHUCK SCARBOROUGH=>Howard Beale interrupted his network news program tonight to announce --
HACKETT=>Shit --
TIM HALLOWAY=>Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a forceful address before the United Nations General Assembly --
HACKETT=>How are we handling it?
MAX=>Halloway's going to make a brief statement at the end of the show to the effect Howard's been under great personal stress, et cetera
HACKETT=>I'll call you back, John. All right. We've got a stockholders' meeting tomorrow at which we're going to announce the restructuring of management plan, and I don't want this grotesque incident to interfere with that. I'll suggest Mr. Ruddy open with a short statement washing this whole thing off, and, you, Max, better have some answers in case some of those nuts that always come to stockholders' meetings --
MAX=>Mr. Beale has been under great personal and professional pressures --
HACKETT=>I've got some goddam surprises for you too, Schumacher! I've had it up to here with your cruddy division and its annual thirty-three million dollar deficit! --
MAX=>Keep your hands off my news division Frank. We're responsible to corporate level, not to you.
HACKETT=>We'll goddam well see about that!
CHANEY=>All right, take it easy. Right now, how' re we going to get Beale out of here? I understand there's at least a hundred reporters and camera crews ings --
HERRON=>Diana asked if she could sit in on this --
MAX=>Fine -- How's it going?
MAX=>Max Schumacher -- I'm glad I got you, John. Listen, I got into a hassle with Frank Hackett last night over the Howard Beale thing, and he made a crack about the stockholders' meeting this afternoon. He said something about having some surprises for me. Is there something going on, John, I don't know about? ... John, I'm counting on you and Mr. Ruddy to back me up against that son of a bitch Okay, see you this afternoon --
MAX=>Who's that, Laureen Hobbs?
HERRON=>Yeah.
LAUREEN HOBBS=>The Communist Party believes that the most pressing political necessity today is the consolidation of the revolutionary, radical and democratic movements into a United Front --
MAX=>Yeah? ... Oh, goddamit, when, Louise? Well, did he say anything? ... All right, thanks. Four-eight-oh-seven --
HERRON=>What we're going to see now is something really sensational. The Flagstaff Independent Bank in Arizona was ripped off last week by a terrorist group called the Ecumenical Liberation Army, and they themselves actually took movies of the rip-off while they were ripping it off. It's in black and white, but wait'll you see it --
DIANA=>The Ecumenical Liberation Army -- is that the one that kidnapped Patty Hearst?
HERRON=>No, that's the Symbionese Liberation Army. This is the Ecumenical Liberation Army. They're the ones who kidnapped Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago. There's a hell of a lot of liberation armies in the revolutionary underground and a lot of kidnapped heiresses. That's Mary Ann Gifford --
DIANA=>You mean, they actually shot this film while they were ripping off the bank?
HERRON=>Yeah, wait'll you see it. I don't know whether to edit or leave it raw like this. That's the Great Ahmed Khan; he's the leader --
DIANA=>This is terrific stuff. Where did you get it?
HERRON=>I got everything through Laureen Hobbs. She's my contact for all this stuff.
DIANA=>I thought she was straight Communist Party.
HERRON=>Right. But she's trying to unify all the factions in the underground, so she knows everybody.
MAX=>Yeah? ... All right, put him on --
HARRY HUNTER=>Howard -- I've got Max on four, would you pick up? --
HOWARD=>Listen, Max, I'd like another shot --
MAX=>Oh, come on, Howard --
HOWARD=>I don't mean the whole show. I'd just like to come on, make some kind of brief farewell statement and then turn the show over to Jack Snowden. I have eleven years at this network, Max. I have some standing in this industry. I don't want to go out like a clown. It'll be simple and dignified. You and Harry can check the copy
HARRY HUNTER=>-- I think it'll take the strain off the show, Max. How much time do you want, Howard?
HOWARD=>A minute forty-five, maybe two
HARRY HUNTER=>All right, I'll give you two on the top, then we'll go to Jack Snowden with the Kissinger UN speech --
MAX=>And no booze today, Howard --
HOWARD=>No booze --
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>You all right, Mr. Beale? You want me to close your door, Mr. Beale?
DIANA=>George, can you come in my office for a minute?
DIANA=>Barbara, is Tommy around anywhere?
DIANA=>I'd like to see the two of you for a moment --
DIANA=>This is Bill Herron from our West Coast Special Programs Department -- Barbara Schlesinger -- George Bosch -- Tommy Pellegrino -- Look, I just saw some rough footage of a special Bill's doing on the revolutionary underground. Most of it's tedious stuff of Laureen Hobbs and four fatigue jackets muttering mutilated Marxism. But he's got about eight minutes of a bank robbery that is absolutely sensational. Authentic stuff. Actually shot while the robbery was going on. Remember the Mary Ann Gifford kidnapping? Well, it's that bunch of nuts. She's in the film shooting off machine guns. Really terrific footage. I think we can get a hell of a movie of the week out of it, maybe even a series.
PELLEGRINO=>A series out of what? What're we talking about?
DIANA=>Look, we've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals called the Ecumenical Liberation Army who go around taking home movies of themselves robbing banks. Maybe they'll take movies of themselves kidnapping heiresses, hijacking 747's, bombing bridges, assassinating ambassadors. We'd open each week's segment with that authentic footage, hire a couple of writers to write some story behind that footage, and we've got ourselves a series.
BOSCH=>A series about a bunch of bank- robbing guerillas?
SCHLESINGER=>What're we going to call it -- the Mao Tse Tung Hour?
DIANA=>Why not? They've got Strike Force, Task Force, SWAT -- why not Che Guevara and his own little mod squad? Listen, I sent you all a concept analysis report yesterday. Did any of you read it? Well, in a nutshell, it said the American people are turning sullen. They've been clobbered on all sides by Vietnam, Watergate, the inflation, the depression. They've turned off, shot up, and they've fucked themselves limp. And nothing helps. Evil still triumphs over all, Christ is a dope-dealing pimp, even sin turned out to be impotent. The whole world seems to be going nuts and flipping off into space like an abandoned balloon. So -- this concept analysis report concludes -- the American people want somebody to articulate their rage for them. I've been telling you people since I took this job six months ago that I want angry shows. I don't want conventional programming on this network. I want counter-culture. I want anti-establishment.
DIANA=>Now, I don't want to play butch boss with you people. But when I took over this department, it had the worst programming record in television history. This network hasn't one show in the top twenty. This network is an industry joke. We better start putting together one winner for next September. I want a show developed, based on the activities of a terrorist group. Joseph Stalin and his merry band of Bolsheviks. I want ideas from you people. And, by the way, the next time I send an audience research report around, you all better read it, or I'll sack the fucking lot of you, is that clear? I'll be out on the coast in four weeks. Can you set up a meeting with Laureen Hobbs for me?
HERRON=>Sure.
HACKETT=>... but the business of management is management; and, at the time C. C. and A. took control, the UBS-TV network was foundering with less than seven percent of national television revenues, most network programs being sold at station rates. I am therefore pleased to announce I am submitting to the Board of Directors a plan for the coordination of the main profit centers, and with the specific intention of making each division more responsive to management --
HACKETT=>... point one. The division producing the lowest rate of return has been the News Division --
HACKETT=>-- with its 98 million dollar budget and its average annual deficit of 32 million. To me, it is inconceivable such a wanton fiscal affront go unresisted --
HACKETT=>-- The new plan calls for local news to be transferred to Owned Stations Divisions --
HACKETT=>-- News-Radio would be transferred to the UBS Radio Division --
HACKETT=>-- from an independent division to a department accountable to network --
MAX=>What was that all about, Ed? --
RUDDY=>This is not the time, Max.
MAX=>Why wasn't I told about this? Why was I led onto that podium and publicly guillotined in front of the stockholders? Goddammit, I spoke to John Wheeler this morning, and he assured me the News Division was safe. Are you trying to get me to resign? It's a hell of a way to do it.
RUDDY=>We'll talk about this tomorrow at our regular morning meeting.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>... five seconds --
LIGHTING DIRECTOR=>-- picture's too thick --
DIRECTOR=>-- coming to -- and one --
HOWARD=>Good evening. Today is Wednesday, September the twenty-fourth, and this is my last broadcast. Yesterday, I announced on this program that I would commit public suicide, admittedly an act of madness. Well, I'll tell you what happened -- I just ran out of bullshit --
HARRY HUNTER=>All right, cut him off.
MAX=>Leave him on --
HOWARD=>Am I still on the air?
MAX=>If this is how he wants to go out, this is how he goes out.
HOWARD=>I don't know any other way to say it except I just ran out of bull- shit ...
HUNTER=>Look, Mr. Schumacher's right here, do you want to talk to him?
HOWARD=>Bullshit is all the reasons we give for living, and, if we can't think up any reasons of our own, we always have the God bullshit --
HUNTER'S SECRETARY=>Holy Mary Mother of Christ --
MAX=>Yeah, what is it, Tom? --
HOWARD=>We don't know why the hell we're going through all this pointless pain, humiliation and decay, so there better be someone somewhere who does know; that's the God bullshit --
MAX=>He's saying life is bullshit, and it is, so what're you screaming about? --
HOWARD=>If you don't like the God bullshit, how about the man bullshit? Man is a noble creature who can order his own world, who needs God?
HUNTER'S SECRETARY=>Mr. Amundsen for you, Mr. Schumacher.
MAX=>I'm not taking calls.
HOWARD=>Well, if there's anybody out there who can look around this demented slaughterhouse of a world we live in and tell me man is a noble creature, that man is full of bullshit --
DIRECTOR=>I know he's sober, so he's got to be just plain nuts --
HARRY HUNTER=>What's so goddam funny?
DIRECTOR=>I can't help it, Harry, it's funny --
HOWARD=>I don't have any kids --
HARRY HUNTER=>Max, this is going out live to sixty-seven affiliates --
MAX=>Leave him on.
HOWARD=>-- and I was married for thirty- three years of shrill, shrieking fraud --
YOUNG WOMAN=>Mr. Hackett's trying to get through to you --
MAX=>Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself --
HOWARD=>I don't have any bullshit left. I just ran out of it, you see --
HACKETT=>Get him off! Are you people nuts?!
RUDDY=>-- I'm sorry, I don't have all the facts yet --
RUDDY=>I'll want to see Mr. Beale after this.
RUDDY=>The way I hear it, Max, you're primarily responsible for this colossally stupid prank. Is that the fact, Max?
MAX=>That's the fact.
RUDDY=>It was unconscionable. There doesn't seem to be anything more to say.
MAX=>I have something to say, Ed. I'd like to know why that whole debasement of the News Division announced at the stockholders' meeting today was kept secret from me. You and I go back twenty years, Ed. I took this job with your personal assurance that you would back my autonomy against any encroachment. But ever since CCA acquired control of the UBS Systems ten months ago, Hackett's been taking over everything. Who the hell's running this network, you or some conglomerate called CCA? I mean, you're the Chairman of the Systems Group, and Frank Hackett's just CCA's hatchet man. Nelson here -- for Pete's sake, he's the president of the network -- he hasn't got anything to say about anything anymore. Who the hell's running this company, you or CCA?
RUDDY=>I told you at the stockholders' meeting, Max, that we would discuss all that at our regular meeting tomorrow morning. If you had been patient, I would've explained to you that I too thought Frank Hackett precipitate and that the reorgani- zation of the News Division would not be executed until everyone, specifically you, Max, had been consulted and satisfied. Instead, you sulked off like a child and engaged this network in a shocking and disgraceful episode. Your position here is no longer tenable regardless of how management is restructured. I expect you to bring in your resignation at ten o'clock tomorrow morning, and we will coordinate our statements to the least detriment of everyone. Bob McDonough will take over the News Division till we sort all this out. I'd like to see Mr. Beale now --
CHANEY=>They're looking for him, Ed. They don't know where he is --
HOWARD=>-- every day, five days a week, for fifteen years, I've been sitting behind that desk -- the dispassionate pundit --
HOWARD=>-- reporting with seemly detachment the daily parade of lunacies that constitute the news -- and --
HOWARD=>-- just once I wanted to say what I really felt --
DIANA=>Knock it off, Arthur --
DIANA=>Did the overnight ratings come in yet?
SECRETARY=>They're on your desk.
DIANA=>Have you still got yesterday's overnights around?
SECRETARY=>Shall I bring them in?
DIANA=>Yeah --
SCHLESINGER=>These are those four outlines submitted by Universal for an hour series. You needn't bother to read them. I'll tell them to you. The first one is set in a large Eastern law school, pre- sumably Harvard. The series is irresistibly entitled The Young Lawyers. The running characters are a crusty but benign ex-Supreme Court Justice, presumably Oliver Wendell Holmes by way of Dr. Zorba. There is a beautiful girl graduate student and the local district attorney who is brilliant and sometimes cuts corners --
DIANA=>Next one --
SCHLESINGER=>The second one is called The Amazon Squad --
DIANA=>Lady cops?
SCHLESINGER=>The running characters are a crusty but benign police lieutenant who's always getting heat from the Commissioner, a hard-nosed, hard- drinking detective who thinks women belong in the kitchen, and a brilliant and beautiful young girl cop fighting the feminist battle on the force --
DIANA=>We're up to our ears in lady cop shows.
SCHLESINGER=>The next one is another investi- gative reporter show. A crusty but benign managing editor who's always getting heat from the publisher --
DIANA=>The Arabs have decided to jack up the price of oil another twenty per cent, and the C.I.A. has been caught opening Senator Humphrey's mail, there's a civil war in Angola, another one in Beirut, New York City's facing default, they've finally caught up with Patricia Hearst, and -- -- the whole front page of the Daily News is Howard Beale.
DIANA=>-- it was also a two-column story on page one of the Times -- Helen, call Mr. Hackett's office, see if he can give me a few minutes this morning --
MAX=>Ladies and gentlemen, I've been at this network twelve years, and it's been on the whole a ball --
MAX=>-- and I want to thank you all. Bob McDonough here will be taking over for me for the time being, and, much as I hate to admit it, I'm sure everything will go along just fine without me --
HACKETT=>KTNS Kansas City refuses to carry our network news any more unless Beale is taken off the air --
DIANA=>Did you see the overnights on the Network News? It has an 8 in New York and a 9 in L.A. and a 27 share in both cities. Last night, Howard Beale went on the air and yelled bullshit for two minutes, and I can tell you right now that tonight's show will get a 30 share at least. I think we've lucked into something.
HACKETT=>Oh, for God's sakes, are you suggesting we put that lunatic back on the air yelling bullshit?
DIANA=>Yes, I think we should put Beale
HACKETT=>What do you mean, you want that show? It's a news show. It's not your department.
DIANA=>I see Howard Beale as a latter-day prophet, a magnificent messianic figure, inveighing against the hypocrisies of our times, a strip Savonarola, Monday through Friday. I tell you, Frank, that could just go through the roof. And I'm talking about a six dollar cost per thousand show! I'm talking about a hundred, a hundred thirty thousand dollar minutes! Do you want to figure out the revenues of a strip show that sells for a hundred thousand bucks a minute? One show like that could pull this whole network right out of the hole! Now, Frank, it's being handed to us on a plate; let's not blow it!
HACKETT=>Yes? ... Tell him I'll be a few minutes. Let me think it over.
DIANA=>Frank, let's not go to committee about this. It's twenty after ten, and we want Beale in that studio by half-past six. We don't want to lose the momentum --
HACKETT=>For God's sakes, Diana, we're talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on national television. I'd like to talk to Legal Affairs at least. And Herb Thackeray and certainly Joe Donnelly and Standards and Practices. And you know I'm going to be eyeball to eyeball with Mr. Ruddy on this. If I'm going to the mat with Ruddy, I want to make sure of some of my ground. I'm the one whose ass is going on the line. I'll get back to you, Diana.
CHANEY=>I don't believe this! I don't believe the top brass of a national television network are sitting around their Caesar salads --
HACKETT=>The top brass of a bankrupt national television network, with projected losses of close to a hundred and fifty million dollars this year.
CHANEY=>I don't care how bankrupt! You can't seriously be proposing and the rest of us seriously consider- ing putting on a pornographic network news show! The FCC will kill us!
HACKETT=>Sit down, Nelson. The FCC can't do anything except rap our knuckles.
AMUNDSEN=>I don't even want to think about the litigious possibilities, Frank. We could be up to our ears in lawsuits.
CHANEY=>The affiliates won't carry it --
HACKETT=>The affiliates will kiss your ass if you can hand them a hit show.
CHANEY=>The popular reaction --
HACKETT=>We don't know the popular reaction. That's what we have to find out.
CHANEY=>The New York Times --
HACKETT=>The New York Times doesn't advertise on our network.
CHANEY=>All I know is that this violates every canon of respectable broad- casting.
HACKETT=>We're not a respectable network. We're a whorehouse network, and we have to take whatever we can get.
CHANEY=>Well, I don't want any part of it. I don't fancy myself the president of a whorehouse.
HACKETT=>That's very commendable of you, Nelson. Now, sit down. Your indignation has been duly recorded, you can always resign tomorrow.
HACKETT=>Look, what in substance are we proposing? -- merely to add editorial comment to our network news show. Brinkley, Sevareid, and Reasoner all have their comments. So now Howard Beale will have his. I think we ought to give it a shot. Let's see what happens tonight.
DONNELLY=>Well, I don't want to be the Babylonian messenger who has to tell Max Schumacher about this.
HACKETT=>Max Schumacher doesn't work at this network any more. Mr. Ruddy fired him last night. A telephone, please -- Bob McDonoguh's running the News Division now --
HACKETT=>Bob McDonough in News, please --
MAX=>-- I'm just fine financially, Fred. I cashed in my stock options back in April when CC and A took over the network That's my other phone, Fred, thanks for calling -- Max Schumacher . .. Hi, Dick, how's everything at NBC? --
MAX=>I don't know, Dick. I might teach, I might write a book, whatever the hell one does when one approaches the autumn of one's years --
MAX=>My God, is that me? Was I ever that young? Howard just showed me a picture of the whole Ed Murrow gang when I was at CBS. My God, Bob Trout, Harry Reasoner, Cronkite, Hollenbeck, and that's you, Howard, right? -- I'll see you, Dick --
HOWARD=>You remember this kid? He's the kid I think you once sent out to interview Cleveland Amory on vivisection --
MAX=>That's him -- that's him --
STEINMAN=>What the hell's so funny?
MAX=>-- I jump out of bed in my pajamas! I grab my raincoat, run down the stairs, run out into the middle of the street, flag a cab. I jump in, I yell: "Take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge!" --
MAX=>-- The driver turns around, he says: "Don't do it, kid, you got your whole life ahead of you!"
STEINMAN=>What're you talking about?
HOWARD=>Hey, that sounds pretty good --
MAX=>Who's this they?
MAX=>Christenson? What's she got to do with it?
HOWARD=>Hold it, McDonough, that's my job you're turning down. I'll go nuts without some kind of work. What's wrong with being an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times? What do you think, Max?
MAX=>Do you want to be an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?
HOWARD=>Yeah, I think I'd like to be an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.
MAX=>Then grab it.
VIDEOTAPE MAN=>Afternoon, Mr. Ruddy --
RUDDY=>Good afternoon.
SECRETARIES=>Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy -- Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy -- etc.
MITZI=>He's waiting for you, Mr. Ruddy --
RUDDY=>Thank you.
RUDDY=>Nelson Chaney tells me Beale may actually go on the air this evening.
MAX=>As far as I know, Howard's going to do it. Are you going to sit still for this, Ed?
RUDDY=>Yes. I think Hackett's overstepped himself. There's some kind of corporate maneuvering going on, Max. Hackett is clearly forcing a confrontation. That would account for his behavior at the stockholders' meeting. However, I think he's making a serious mistake with this Beale business. C. C. and A. would never make such an open act of brigandage, especially against the News Division. They are specifically enjoined against any manipulation of the News Division in the consent decree. I suspect C. C. and A. will be upset by Hackett's presumptuousness, certainly Mr. Jensen will. So I'm going to let Hackett have his head for awhile. He just might lose it over this Beale business. I'd like you to reconsider your resignation. I have to assume Hackett wouldn't take such steps without some support on the C. C. and A. board. I'll have to go directly to Mr. Jensen. When that happens, I'm going to need every friend I've got. And I certainly don't want Hackett's people in all the divisional positions. So I'd like you to stay on, Max.
MAX=>Of course, Ed.
RUDDY=>Thank you, Max.
NARRATOR=>The initial response to the new Howard Beale was not auspicatory. The press was without exception hostile and industry reaction negative. The ratings for the Thursday and Friday show were both 14 and with a 37 share, but Monday's rating dropped two points, clearly suggesting the novelty had worn off --
NARRATOR=>-- Indeed, Howard Beale played his new role of latter-day prophet poorly. He was, after all, a newsman, not an actor. He was uncertain, uncomfortable, sometimes inaudible. The general feeling around the network was that this new Howard Beale would be aborted in a matter of days --
DIANA=>Did you know there are a number of psychics working as licensed brokers on Wall Street? Some of them counsel their clients by use of Tarot cards. They're all pretty successful, even in a bear market and selling short. I met one of them a couple of weeks ago and thought of doing a show around her -- The Wayward Witch of Wall Street, something like that. But, of course, if her tips were any good, she could wreck the market. So I called her this morning and asked her how she was on predicting the future. She said she was occasionally prescient. "For example", she said, "I just had a fleeting vision of you sitting in an office with a craggy middle-aged man with whom you are or will be emotionally involved." And here I am.
MAX=>She does all this with Tarot cards?
DIANA=>No, this one operates on parapsychology. She has trance- like episodes and feels things in her energy field. I think this lady can be very useful to you, Max.
MAX=>In what way?
DIANA=>Well, you put on news shows, and here's someone who can predict tomorrow's news for you. Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl. Sybil the Soothsayer. You could give her two minutes of trance at the end of a Howard Beale show, say once a week, Friday, which is suggestively occult, and she could oraculate. Then next week, everyone tunes in to see how good her predictions were.
MAX=>Maybe she could do the weather.
DIANA=>Your network news show is going to need some help, Max, if it's going to hold. Beale doesn't do the angry man thing well at all. He's too kvetchy. He's being irascible. We want a prophet, not a curmudgeon. He should do more apocalyptic doom. I think you should take on a couple of writers to write some jeremiads for him. I see you don't fancy my suggestions.
MAX=>Hell, you're not being serious, are you?
DIANA=>Oh, I'm serious. The fact is, I could make your Beale show the highest-rated news show in television, if you'd let me have a crack at it.
MAX=>What do you mean, have a crack at it?
DIANA=>I'd like to program it for you, develop it. I wouldn't interfere with the actual news. But teevee is show biz, Max, and even the News has to have a little showmanship.
MAX=>My God, you are serious.
DIANA=>I watched your six o'clock news today -- it's straight tabloid. You had a minute and a half on that lady riding a bike naked in Central Park. On the other hand, you had less than a minute of hard national and international news. It was all sex, scandal, brutal crimes, sports, children with incurable diseases and lost puppies. So I don't think I'll listen to any protestations of high standards of journalism. You're right down in the street soliciting audiences like the rest of us. All I'm saying is, if you're going to hustle, at least do it right. I'm going to bring this up at tomorrow's network meeting, but I don't like network hassles, and I was hoping you and I could work this out between us. That's why I'm here right now.
MAX=>And I was hoping you were looking for an emotional involvement with a craggy middle-aged man.
DIANA=>I wouldn't rule that out entirely.
MAX=>Well, Diana, you bring all your ideas up at the meeting tomorrow. Because, if you don't, I will. I think Howard is making a goddam fool of himself, and so does everybody Howard and I know in this industry. It was a fluke. It didn't work. Tomorrow, Howard goes back to the old format and this gutter depravity comes to an end.
DIANA=>Okay.
MAX=>I don't get it, Diana. You hung around till half-past seven and came all the way down here just to pitch a couple of loony show biz ideas when you knew goddam well I'd laugh you out of this office. I don't get it. What's your scam in this anyway?
DIANA=>Max, I don't know why you suddenly changed your mind about resigning, but I do know Hackett's going to throw you out on your ass in January. My little visit here tonight was just a courtesy made out of respect for your stature in the industry and because I've personally admired you ever since I was a kid majoring in speech at the University of Missouri. But sooner or later, now or in January, with or without you, I'm going to take over your network news show, and I figured I might as well start tonight.
MAX=>I think I once gave a lecture at the University of Missouri.
DIANA=>I was in the audience. I had a terrible schoolgirl crush on you for a couple of months.
MAX=>Listen, if we can get back for a moment to that gypsy who predicted all that about emotional involvements and middle-aged men -- what're you doing for dinner tonight?
DIANA=>I can't make it tonight, luv, call me tomorrow.
MAX=>Do you have any favorite restaurant?
DIANA=>I eat anything.
MAX=>Son of a bitch, I get the feeling I'm being made.
DIANA=>You sure are.
MAX=>I better warn you I don't do anything on the first date.
DIANA=>We'll see.
MAX=>Schmuck, what're you getting into?
DIANA=>You're married, surely.
MAX=>Twenty-six years. I have a married daughter in Seattle who's six months pregnant, and a younger girl who starts at Northwestern in January.
DIANA=>-- Well, Max, here we are -- middle-aged man reaffirming his middle-aged manhood and a terrified young woman with a father complex. What sort of script do you think we can make out of this?
MAX=>Terrified, are you?
DIANA=>Terrified out of my skull, man. I'm the hip generation, man, right on, cool, groovy, the greening of America, man, remember all that? God, what humbugs we were. In my first year at college, I lived in a commune, dropped acid daily, joined four radical groups and fucked myself silly on a bare wooden floor while somebody chanted Sufi sutras. I lost six weeks of my sophomore year because they put me away for trying to jump off the top floor of the Administration Building. I've been on the top floor ever since. Don't open any windows around me because I just might jump out. Am I scaring you off?
MAX=>No.
DIANA=>I was married for four years and pretended to be happy and had six years of analysis and pretended to be sane. My husband ran off with his boyfriend, and I had an affair with my analyst. He told me I was the worst lay he had ever had. I can't tell you how many men have told me what a lousy lay I am. I apparently have a masculine temperament. I arouse quickly, consummate prematurely, and can't wait to get my clothes back on and get out of that bedroom. I seem to be inept at everything except my work. I'm goddam good at my work and so I confine myself
MAX=>The corridor gossip says you're Frank Hackett's backstage girl.
DIANA=>I'm not. Frank's a corporation man, body and soul. He surrendered his spirit to C. C. and A. years ago. He's a marketing-merchandising management machine, precision- tooled for corporate success. He's married to one C. C. and A. board member's daughter, he attends another board member's church, his children aged two and five are already enrolled in a third board member's alma mater. He has no loves, lusts or allegiances that are not consummately directed towards becoming a C. C. and A. board member himself. So why should he bother with me? I'm not even a stockholder.
MAX=>How about your loves, lusts and allegiances?
DIANA=>Is your wife in town?
MAX=>Yes.
DIANA=>Well, then, we better go to my place.
DIANA=>Wow, and you were the guy who kept telling me how he was going to be a grandfather in three months.
MAX=>Hell, you were the girl who kept telling me what a lousy lay she was.
DIANA=>All right, enough of this love-making. Are you going to let me take over your network news show or not?
MAX=>Forget it. Tomorrow, Howard Beale goes back to being a straight anchorman. I'll tell him first thing tomorrow morning.
HOWARD=>I can't hear you. You'll have to speak a little louder.
HOWARD=>You're kidding. How the hell would I know what the truth is?
HOWARD=>What the hell is this, the burning bush? For God's sake, I'm not Moses --
HOWARD=>Why me? I'm a deteriorating old man.
HOWARD=>Okay.
MAX=>Howard in his office? Harry, I'm killing this whole screwball angry prophet thing. We're going back to straight news as of tonight's show.
HUNTER=>Okay.
MAX=>Howard, we're going back to straight news tonight. You don't have to be the mad prophet any more.
HOWARD=>I must go on with what I'm doing, Max. I have been called. This is my witness, and I must make it.
MAX=>You must make what, Howard?
HOWARD=>I must make my witness. I must lead the people from the waters. I must stay their stampede to the sea.
MAX=>You must stay their what, Howard?
HOWARD=>I must stay their headlong suicidal stampede to the sea.
MAX=>Well, hallelujah, Howard, are you putting me on or have you flipped or what?
HOWARD=>I have heard voices, Max.
MAX=>You have heard voices. Swell. What kind of voices, Howard? Still small voices in the night or the mighty thunder of God? Howard, you've finally done it. You've gone over the edge. You're nuts.
HOWARD=>I have been called. This is my witness, and I must make it.
MAX=>Not on my goddam network news show.
MAX=>Now, look, Howard, I'm not kidding around about this. You go back to being a straight anchorman tonight. I'm the voice you're hearing now, and this voice is telling you we're doing a straight news show from now on. Okay?
HUNTER=>Max, I'm telling you he's fine. He's been sharp all day, he's been funny as hell. He had everybody cracking up at the rundown meeting ... I told him, I told him ...
HOWARD=>Last night, I was awakened from a fitful sleep at shortly after two o'clock in the morning by a shrill, sibilant, faceless voice that was sitting in my rocking chair. I couldn't make it out at first in the dark bedroom. I said: "I'm sorry, you'll have to talk a little louder." And the Voice said to me: "I want you to tell the people the truth, not an easy thing to do; because the people don't want to know the truth." I said: "You're kidding. How the hell would I know what the truth is?" I mean, you have to picture me sitting there on the foot of the bed talking to an empty rocking chair. I said to myself: "Howard, you are some kind of banjo-brain sitting here talking to an empty chair." But the Voice said to me: "Don't worry about the truth. I'll put the words in your mouth." And I said: "What is this, the burning bush? For God's sake, I'm not Moses." And the Voice said to me: "And I'm not God, what's that got to do with it --"
HUNTER=>What do you want me to do? --
MAX=>Nothing --
HOWARD=>And the Voice said to me: "We're not talking about eternal truth or absolute truth or ultimate truth! We're talking about impermanent, transient, human truth! I don't expect you people to be capable of truth! But, goddamit, you're at least capable of self-preservation! That's good enough! I want you to go out and tell the people to preserve themselves -- "
MAX=>Right now, I'm trying to remember the name of that psychiatrist that took care of him when his wife died --
HOWARD=>And I said to the Voice: "Why me?" And the Voice said: "Because you're on television, dummy! -- "
DIANA=>Beautiful!
HOWARD=>"You have forty million Americans listening to you; after tonight's show, you could have fifty million. For Pete's sake, I don't expect you to walk the land in sackcloth and ashes preaching the Armageddon. You're on Teevee, man! -- "
HOWARD=>So I thought about it for a moment --
HOWARD=>And then I said: "Okay -- "
MAX=>Doctor Sindell? My name is Max Schumacher, I'm at the Union Broadcasting Systems, and I hope you remember me? I'm a friend of Howard Beale whom you treated for a few months last year --
MAX=>Close the door, Harry --
MAX=>Sit down, Howard. Howard, I'm taking you off the air. I called your psychiatrist.
HOWARD=>
MAX=>I think you're having a breakdown, require treatment, and Dr. Sindell agrees.
HOWARD=>This is not a psychotic episode. It is a cleansing moment of clarity. I am imbued, Max. I am imbued with some special spirit. It's not a religious feeling at all. It is a shocking eruption of great electrical energy: I feel vivid and flashing as if suddenly I had been plugged into some great cosmic electromagnetic field. I feel connected to all living things, to flowers, birds, to all the animals of the world and even to some great unseen living force, what I think the Hindus call prana.
HOWARD=>It is not a breakdown. I have never felt so orderly in my life! It is a shattering and beautiful sensation! It is the exalted flow of the space-time continuum, save that it is spaceless and timeless and of such loveliness! I feel on the verge of some great ultimate truth.
HOWARD=>You will not take me off the air for now or for any other spaceless time!
MAX=>Jesus Christ --
HUNTER=>Is he okay?
MAX=>He's breathing anyway. I'll have to take him to my house again for the night --
LOUISE=>Wake up, Max, because Howard's gone. I'll make you some coffee.
MAX=>Shit.
HACKETT=>What do you mean you don't know where he is? The son of a bitch is a hit, goddammit! Over two thousand phone calls! Go down to the mailroom! As of this minute, over fourteen thousand telegrams! The response is sensational! Herb, tell him! --
HACKETT=>Herb's phone hasn't stopped ringing! Every goddam affiliate from Albuquerque to Sandusky! The response is sensational!
HACKETT=>What? ... All right
HACKETT=>It's your office, Herb. You better get back there.
HACKETT=>Moldanian called me! Joe Donnelly called me! We've got a goddam hit, goddam it! Diana, show him the Times! We even got an editorial in the holy goddam New York Times. "A Call to Morality!" That crazy son of a bitch, Beale, has caught on! So don't tell me you don't know where he is!
MAX=>I don't know where he is! He may be jumping off a roof for all I know. The man is insane. He's no longer responsible for himself. He needs care and treatment. And all you grave-robbers care about is he's a hit!
DIANA=>You know, Max, it's just possible that he isn't insane, that he is, in fact, imbued with some special spirit.
MAX=>My God, I'm supposed to be the romantic; you're supposed to be the hard-bitten realist!
DIANA=>All right. Howard Beale obviously fills a void. The audience out there obviously wants a prophet, even a manufactured one, even
MAX=>I'm not putting Howard back on the air.
DIANA=>It's not your show any more, Max, it's mine.
MAX=>You're nuts. You're nuttier than Howard.
HACKETT=>I gave her the show, Schumacher. I'm putting the network news show under programming. Mr. Ruddy has had a mild heart attack and is not taking calls. In his absence, I'm making all network decisions, including one I've been wanting to make a long time -- you're fired. I want you out of this building by noon. I'll leave word with the security guards to throw you out if you're still here.
MAX=>Well, let's just say, fuck you, Hackett. You want me out, you're going to have to drag me out kicking and screaming. And the whole news division will walk out kicking and screaming with me.
HACKETT=>You think they're going to quit their jobs for you. Not in this depression, buddy.
MAX=>When Ruddy gets back, he'll have your ass.
HACKETT=>I got a hit, Schumacher, and Ruddy doesn't count any more. He was hoping I'd fall on my face with this Beale show, but I didn't. It's a big, fat, big-titted hit, and I don't have to waffle around with Ruddy any more. If he wants to take me up before the C.C. and A. board, let him. And do you think Ruddy's stupid enough to go to the CCA board and say: "I'm taking our one hit show off the air?" And comes November Fourteen, I'm going to be standing up there at the annual CCA management review meeting, and I'm going to announce projected earnings for this network for the first time in five years. And, believe me, Mr. Jensen will be sitting there rocking back and forth in his little chair, and he's going to say: "That's very good, Frank, keep it up." So don't have any illusions about who's running this network from now on. You're fired. I want you out of your office before noon or I'll have you thrown out. And you go along with this?
DIANA=>Well, Max, I told you I didn't want a network hassle over this. I told you I'd much rather work the Beale show out just between the two of us.
MAX=>Well, let's just say, fuck you too, honey. Howard Beale may be my best friend! I'll go to court. I'll put him in a hospital before I let you exploit him like a carnival freak.
HACKETT=>You get your psychiatrists, and I'll get mine.
MAX=>I'm going to spread this whole reeking business in every paper and on every network, independent, group, and affiliated station in this country. I'm going to make a lot of noise about this.
HACKETT=>Great! we need all the press we can get.
HACKETT=>Get me Mr. Cabell -- Something going on between you and Schumacher?
DIANA=>Not any more.
HACKETT=>Tom, Howard Beale has disappeared. Tell Harriman to prepare a big statement for the news media. And call the cops and tell them to find the crazy son of a bitch --
SECURITY GUARD=>How do you Mr. Beale?
HOWARD=>I have to make my witness.
SECURITY GUARD=>Sure thing, Mr. Beale.
SNOWDEN=>... Oil ministers of the OPEC nations meeting in Vienna still haven't decided how much more to increase the price of oil next Wednesday. Iran and some of the Arab states want to jack up the price by as much as twenty percent --
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>Five seconds --
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR=>Twenty-five in Vienna --
DIRECTOR=>And ... two --
SNOWDEN=>The Saudi Arabians are being more cautious. They just want a ten per- cent increase. More on that story from Edward Fletcher in Vienna --
HUNTER=>Yeah? ... Okay -- He came in the building about five minutes ago.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>Ten seconds coming to one --
DIANA=>Tell Snowden if he comes in the studio to let him go on.
HUNTER=>Did you get that, Paul?
FLETCHER=>This has probably been the most divisive meeting the oil-producing states have ever had. The thirteen nations of OPEC have still not been able to decide by how much to increase the price of oil --
FLETCHER=>Saudi Arabian oil minister Sheik Zaki Yamani flew to London yesterday for further consultations with his government. He returned to the Vienna meetings today--
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR=>Ready 2.
DIRECTOR=>Take 2.
HOWARD=>I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job, the dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter, punks are running wild in the streets, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air's unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit and watch our tee-vees while some local newscaster tells us today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We all know things are bad. Worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything's going crazy. So we don't go out any more. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we live in gets smaller, and all we ask is
HOWARD=>I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to write your congressmen. Because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the defense budget and the Russians and crime in the street. All I know is first you got to get mad. You've got to say: "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more. I'm a human being, goddammit. My life has value." So I want you to get up now. I want you to get out of your chairs and go to the window. Right now. I want you to go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell. I want you to yell: "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!"
DIANA=>How many stations does this go out live to?
HUNTER=>Sixty-seven. I know it goes out to Atlanta and Louisville, I think --
HOWARD=>-- Get up from your chairs. Go to the window. Open it. Stick your head out and yell and keep yelling --
DIANA=>Give me Stations Relations -- Herb, this is Diana Christenson, are you watching because I want you to call every affiliate carrying this live -- I'll be right up --
HOWARD=>-- First, you have to get mad. When you're mad enough --
DIANA=>Whom are you talking to?
THACKERAY=>WCGG, Atlanta --
DIANA=>Are they yelling in Atlanta, Herb?
HOWARD=>-- we'll figure out what to do about the depression --
THACKERAY=>Are they yelling in Atlanta, Ted?
HOWARD=>-- and the inflation and the oil crisis --
GENERAL MANAGER=>Herb, s0 help me, I think they're yelling --
PITOFSKY=>They're yelling in Baton Rouge.
HOWARD=>-- Things have got to change. But you can't change them unless you're mad. You have to get mad. Go to the window --
DIANA=>The next time somebody asks you to explain what ratings are, you tell them: that's ratings! Son of a bitch, we struck the mother lode!
HOWARD=>-- Stick your head out and yell. I want you to yell: "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!"
LOUISE SCHUMACHER=>Where are you going?
CAROLINE=>I want to see if anybody's yelling.
HOWARD=>Right now. Get up. Go to your window --
THIN VOICE=>I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any morel
HOWARD=>-- open your window --
MAN=>I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!
VOICES=>I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any morel
NARRATOR=>By mid-October, the Howard Beale show had settled in at a 42 share, more than equaling all the other network news shows combined --
NARRATOR=>In the September rating book, the Howard Beale show was listed as the fourth highest-rated show of the month, surpassed only by All in the Family, Rhoda, and Chico and the Man -- a phenomenal
NARRATOR=>And, on October the Sixteenth, Diana Christenson flew to Los Angeles --
NARRATOR=>-- for what the trade calls pow-wows and confabs with her West Coast programming execs --
DIANA=>Wednesday night looks weak on all three of the other networks for next September, so we concentrate on Wednesday night. We're going to expand the Howard Beale show to an hour in January, which'll give us a hell of a lead-in to eight o'clock. So, on Wednesday nights, I want to follow that with two strong dramatic hours, no sit-coms, nothing lightweight --
HERRON=>I've got Laureen Hobbs' lawyer on the phone. Is five-thirty okay, and where would you like to meet, here or at the hotel?
DIANA=>Let's put Hy Norman at five -- Five-thirty is fine, and at my office, if they don't mind. -- What I want right now are movies of the week we can use for pilots. I want five movies of the week ready by March at the outside, preferably sooner --
KOSSOFF=>Hy, come on in --
KOSSOFF=>Hy, I think you know Barbara Schlesinger, but I don't know if you know Diana Christenson --
NORMAN=>As a matter of fact, I think we met during the 1972 McGovern-for- President campaign, of which, I am proud to say, I was a principal fund raiser --
DIANA=>No, I'm afraid not. Now, Hy, we're running a little late, so I'd like to get right to it. I have an idea for an hour television series, and I'd like to lay it in your lap. Here's the back-up story. The hero is white-collar middle-class, an architect, aviation engineer, anything, a decent law-abiding man. He lives with his wife and daughter in a large city. His wife and daughter are raped and he's mugged. He appeals to the police, but their hands are tied by the Warren Court decisions. There's nothing but pornography in the movies, and vandals bomb his church. The animals are taking over. So he decides to take the law into his own hands. He buys a gun, practices till he's an expert. He takes up karate, becomes a black belt, an adept in Kung Fu and all the other martial arts. Now, he starts walking the streets of the city, decoying muggers into preying on him. He kung fu's them all. Pretty soon, he's joined by a couple of neighbors. What we've got now is a vigilante group. That's the name of the show -- the Vigilantes. The idea is, if the law won't protect the decent people, they have to take the law into their own hands.
NORMAN=>That may be he most fascistic idea I've heard in years.
DIANA=>Right.
NORMAN=>And a shameless steal from a movie called "Death Wish."
DIANA=>I know. And, so far, "Death Wish" has grossed seventeen million domes- tic. It obviously struck a pulse in Americans. I want to strike the same pulse. Now, let me finish, Hy. The format is simple. Every week a crime is committed, and the police are helpless to deal with it. The victim turns to our group of vigi- lantes. What the hell, it's FBI, Mission Impossible, Kojack, except the heroes are ordinary citizens, your neighbors and mine.
NORMAN=>I find the whole thing repulsive.
DIANA=>You give me a pilot script we can use as a movie of the week for January, and I'll commit to twelve segments on the basis of that script.
NORMAN=>You'll commit on the basis of the pilot script?
DIANA=>That's what I said. That's a three million dollar commitment. I figure you could skim a quarter of a million for yourself out of that. Of course, we all know you're a highly principled
NORMAN=>Well -- not necessarily. I deplore vigilante tactics, of course, but the vigilante tradition is a profound, even proud tradition in the American social fabric. This sort of program also offers opportunities for coming to grips with the burning issues of our times, to do meaningful drama and at the same time providing mass enter- tainment --
DIANA=>Beautiful, Hy.
NORMAN=>Who do I talk numbers with, Charlie Kinkaid?
DIANA=>Right. I'll call Charlie and tell him we'll go to forty thousand for the first script. If you come in with anything good, Hy, I'll slot you on Wednesday nights at eight coming right off the Howard Beale Show, and that's the best lead-in you'll ever get.
NORMAN=>Is that Laureen Hobbs out there? What the hell is Laureen Hobbs doing out there?
DIANA=>We're going to put the Communist Party on prime-time television, Hy.
NORMAN=>I wouldn't doubt it for a minute.
DIANA=>Christ, you brought half the William Morris West Coast office with you. I'm Diana Christenson, a racist lackey of the imperialist ruling circles.
LAUREEN=>I'm Laureen Hobbs, a bad-ass Commie nigger.
DIANA=>Sounds like the basis of a firm friendship. We're going to need more chairs --
SCHLESINGER=>Anybody want coffee?
LENNIE=>Black with Sucaryl --
LAUREEN=>This is my lawyer, Sam Haywood, and his associate, Robert Murphy --
HAYWOOD=>Well, MS. Christenson, just what the hell's this all about? Because when a national television network in the person of bubby here -- -- comes to me and says he wants to put the ongoing struggle of the oppressed masses on prime-time television, I have to regard this askance --
HAYWOOD=>I have to figure this as an antithetical distraction. The thesis here, if you follow me, is that the capitalist state is in a terminal condition now, and the anti- thesis is the maturation of the fascist state, and when the correlative appendages of the fascist state come and say to me they want to give the revolution a weekly hour of prime-time television, I've got to figure this is preventive co-optation, right? --
HAYWOOD=>The ruling classes are running scared, right? You turned the full force of your cossack cops and paramilitary organs of repression against us. But now the slave masters hear the rumble of revolution in their ears. So you have no alternative but to co-opt us. Put us on teevee and pull our fangs. And we're supposed to sell out, right? For your gang- stergold? Well, we're not going to sell out, baby! You can take your fascist teevee and shove it right up your paramilitary ass! I'm here to tell you, we don't sell out! We don't want your gold! We're not going on your teevee!
DIANA=>Oh, shit, Mr. Haywood, if you're not interested in my offer, why the hell did you bring two lawyers and three agents from the William Morris office along?
MURPHY=>What Mr. Haywood was saying, Ms. Christenson, was that our client, Ms. Hobbs, wants it up front that the political content of the show has to be entirely in her control.
DIANA=>She can have it. I don't give a damn about the political content.
WALLIE=>What kind of show'd you have in mind, Diana?
DIANA=>We're interested in doing a weekly dramatic series based on the Ecumen- ical Liberation Army, and I'll tell you what the first show has to be -- a two-hour special on Mary Ann Gifford. We open this two-hour special with that bank rip-off footage, which is terrific stuff, and then we tell the story of how a rich young heiress like Mary Ann Gifford becomes a flaming revolutionary. Would you people be interested in making such a movie for us?
LAUREEN=>The Ecumenical Liberation Army is an ultra-left sect creating political confusion with wildcat violence and pseudo-insurrectionary acts, which the Communist Party does not endorse. The American masses are not yet ready for open revolt. We would not want to produce a television show cele- brating historically deviational terrorism.
DIANA=>Even better. I see the story this way. Poor little rich girl kid- napped by ultra-left sect. She falls in love with the leader of the gang, converts to his irrespon- sible violence. But then she meets you, understands the true nature of the ongoing people's struggle for a better society, and, in an emotion- drenched scene, she leaves her devia- tional lover and dedicates herself to you and the historical inevitability of the socialist state.
LAUREEN=>That would be better, of course.
ED=>What kind of numbers are we talking, Diana?
DIANA=>We'll give you our top deal, which I think is two fifteen and twenty- five. You'll have to talk to Charlie Kinkaid about that. But as long as we're talking series now, I'll tell you what I want. I want a lot more film like the bank rip-off the Ecumenicals sent in. The way I see this series is every week we open with the authen- tic footage of an act of political terrorism, taken on the spot and in the actual moment; then we go into the drama behind the opening film footage. That's your job, Ms. Hobbs. You've got to get the Ecumenicals to bring in that film for us. The network can't deal with them directly. They are, after all, wanted criminals.
LAUREEN=>The Ecumenicals are an undisciplined ultra-left gang, and the leader is an eccentric to say the least. He calls himself the Great Ahmed Khan and wears a hussar's shako.
DIANA=>Ms. Hobbs, I'm offering you an hour
LAUREEN=>I'll have to take this matter to the Central Committee, and I'd better check this out with the Great Ahmed Khan.
DIANA=>I'll be in L.A. until Saturday, and I'd like to get this thing rolling. That's going to be our Wednesday night. Seven to eight -- Howard Beale; eight to nine -- the Vigilantes; nine to ten -- the Mao Tse Tung Hour.
KOSSOFF=>God, fascism and the revolution all on one night.
DIANA=>I suppose that's what's called balanced programming.
DOWLING=>Okay --
LAUREEN=>Well, Ahmed, you ain't going to believe this, but I'm going to make a teevee star out of you. Just like Archie Bunker. You're going to be a household word.
AHMED=>What the fuck are you talking about?
DIRECTOR=>-- and one --
ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it -- how do you feel?
AUDIENCE=>We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take this any more!
ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and Gentlemen! The Network News Hour! --
ANNOUNCER=>-- with Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim Webbing and his It's-the-Emmes- Truth Department, Miss Mata Hari tonight another segment of Vox Populi, and starring --
ANNOUNCER=>-- the mad prophet of the airways, Howard Beale! --
HOWARD=>Edward George Ruddy died today! Edward George Ruddy was the Chairman of the Board of the Union Broad- casting Systems -- and woe is us if it ever falls in the hands of the wrong people. And that's why woe is us that Edward George Ruddy died. Because this network is now in the hands of CC and A the Communications Corporation of America. We've got a new Chairman of the Board, a man named Frank Hackett now sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office on the twentieth floor. And when the twelfth largest company in the world controls the most awesome goddamned propaganda force in the whole godless world, who knows what shit will be peddled for truth on this tube? So, listen to me! Television is not the truth! Tele- vision is a goddamned amusement park, that's what television is! Television is a circus, a carnival, a travelling troupe of acrobats and story-tellers, singers and dancers, jugglers, side-show freaks, lion- tamers and football players. We're in the boredom-killing business! If you want truth, go to God, go to your guru, go to yourself because that's the only place you'll ever find any real truth! But, man, you're never going to get any truth from us. We'll tell you anything you want to hear. We lie like hell! We'll tell you Kojack always gets the killer, and nobody ever gets cancer in Archie Bunker's house. And no matter how much trouble the hero is in, don't worry: just look at your watch -- at the end of the hour, he's going to win. We'll tell you any shit you want to hear!
HACKETT=>-- UBS was running at a cash-flow breakeven point after taking into account one hundred and ten million dollars of negative cash-flow from the network. Note please the added thirty-five millions resulting from the issuance of the subordinated sink- ing debentures. It was clear the fat on the network had to be flitched off --
HACKETT=>Please note an increase in pro- jected initial programming rev- enues in the amount of twenty-one million dollars due to the phenom- enal success of the Howard Beale show. I expect a positive cash- flow for the entire complex of forty-five million achievable in this fiscal year, a year, in short, ahead of schedule --
HACKETT=>I go beyond that. This network may well be the most significant profit center of the communications complex --
HACKETT=>-- and, based upon the projected rate of return on invested capital, and if merger is eventually accomplished, the communications complex may well become the towering and most profit- able center in the entire CC and A empire. I await your questions and comments. Mr. Jensen?
JENSEN=>Very good, Frank. Exemplary. Keep it up --
MAX=>Buy you a cup of coffee?
DIANA=>Hell, yes.
MAX=>Do you have to get back to the office?
DIANA=>Nothing that can't wait.
DIANA=>I drop down to the news studios every now and then and ask Howard Beale about you. He says you're doing fine. Are you?
MAX=>No.
DIANA=>Are you keeping busy?
MAX=>After a fashion. This is the third funeral I've been to in two weeks. I have two other friends in hospital whom I visit regularly. I've been to a couple of christenings. All my friends seem to be dying or having grandchildren.
DIANA=>You should be a grandfather about now. You have a pregnant daughter in Seattle, don't you?
MAX=>Any day now. My wife's out there for the occasion. I've thought many times of calling you.
DIANA=>I wish you had.
DIANA=>I bumped into Sybil the Soothsayer in the elevator last week. I said: "You know, Sybil, about four months ago, you predicted I would get involved with a middle-aged man, and, so far, all that's happened is one many-splendored night. I don't call that getting involved." And she said: "Don't worry. You will." It was a many-splendored night, wasn't it, Max?
MAX=>Yes, it was.
DIANA=>Are we going to get involved, Max?
MAX=>Yes. I need to get involved very much. How about you?
DIANA=>I've reached for the phone to call
MAX=>I probably did. I don't know any more. All I know is I can't keep you out of my mind.
DIANA=>My God, she's uncanny.
MAX=>Who?
DIANA=>Sybil the Soothsayer. We've got a modern-day Greek drama here, Max. Two star-crossed lovers ordained to fall disastrously in love by the gods. A December-May story. Happily married middle-aged man meets desperately lonely young career woman, let's say a violinist. They both know their illicit love can only end in tragedy, but they are cursed by the gods and plunge dementedly in love. For a few brief moments, they are happy. He abandons devoted wife and loving children, and she throws away her concert career. Their friends plead with them to give each other up, but they are helpless playthings in the hands of malignant gods. Their love sours, embittered by ugly little jealousies, cryptic rancors. The soothsayer appears again and warns the girl she will die if she per- sists in this heedless love affair. She defies the soothsayer. But now one of the man's children is rushed to the hospital with a mysterious disease. He rushes back to his family, and she is left to throw herself on the railroad tracks. Give me a two-page outline on it, Max. I might be able to sell it to Xerox.
MAX=>A bit too austere for teevee, I think.
DIANA=>You're right. We wouldn't get an 11 rating. How about a twist on Brief Encounter? Happily married man meets woman married to her career.
MAX=>NBC did Brief Encounter last year, and it sank.
DIANA=>Well, we're both a bit long in the tooth to try for Romeo and Juliet.
MAX=>Why don't we just wing it?
LOUISE=>How long has it been going on?
MAX=>A month. I thought at first it might be a transient thing and blow over in a week. I still hope to God it's just a menopausal infatuation. But it is an infa- tuation, Louise. There's no sense my saying I won't see her again because I will. Do you want me to clear out, go to a hotel?
LOUISE=>Do you love her?
MAX=>I don't know how I feel. I'm grateful I still feel anything. I know I'm obsessed with her.
LOUISE=>Then say it! Don't keep telling me you're obsessed, you're infatuated -- say you're in love with her!
MAX=>I'm in love with her.
LOUISE=>Then get out, go to a hotel, go anywhere you want, go live with her, but don't come back! Because after twenty-five years of building a home and raising a family and all the senseless pain we've inflicted on each other, I'll be damned if I'll just stand here and let you tell me you love somebody else! Because this isn't just some con- vention weekend with your secretary, is it? Or some broad you picked up after three belts of booze. This is your great winter romance, isn't it?, your last roar of passion be- fore you sink into your emeritus years. Is that what's left for me? Is that my share? She gets the great winter passion, and I get the dotage? Am I supposed to sit at home knitting and purling till you slink back like a penitent drunk? I'm your wife, damn it! If you can't work up a winter passion for me, then the least I require is respect and allegiance! I'm hurt! Don't you understand that? I'm hurt badly!
LOUISE=>Say something, for God's sake.
MAX=>I've got nothing to say.
LOUISE=>Are you that deeply involved with her?
MAX=>Yes.
LOUISE=>I won't give you up easily, Max.
LOUISE=>I think the best thing is if you did move out. Does she love you, Max?
MAX=>I'm not sure she's capable of any real feelings. She's the television generation. She learned life from Bugs Bunny. The only reality she knows is what comes over her teevee set. She has devised a variety of scenarios for us all to play, as if it were a Movie of the Week. And, my God!, look at us, Louise. Here we are going through the obli- gatory middle-of-Act-Two scorned wife throws peccant husband out scene. But, no fear, I'll come back home in the end. All her plot outlines have me leaving her and returning to you because the audience won't buy a rejection of the happy American family. She does have one script in which I kill myself, an adapted for television version of Anna Karenina in which she's Count Vronsky and I'm Anna.
LOUISE=>You're in for some dreadful grief, Max.
MAX=>I know.
DIANA=>... I know what NBC offered them, Marty, so I'm saying go to three point five, and I want an option for a third run on all of them ... Marty, I'm in a big hurry, and you and Charlie are supposed to be negotiating this, so goodbye and good luck, and I'll see you Monday ...
PELLEGRINO=>Jimmy Caan's agent just called and says absolutely nix.
DIANA=>You can't win them all.
PELLEGRINO=>Where can I reach you later today?
DIANA=>You can't. I'll be gone all weekend.
PELLEGRINO=>I think the Dragon Lady got her- self a dragon fellow.
SCHLESINGER=>Poor bastard.
DIANA=>NBC's offering three point two and a half mil per for a package of five James Bond pictures, and I think I'm going to steal them for three point five with a third run --
DIANA=>The vigilante show is sold firm. Ford took a complete position at, so help me, five-fifty CPM. In fact, I'm moving the vigilante show to nine and I'm going to stick the Mao Tse Tung Hour in at eight because we're having a lot of trouble selling the Mao Tse Tung Hour. This way we give it a terrific lead-in from the Howard Beale Show and we'll back into the vigilantes, and it certainly ought to carry its own time slot --
DIANA=>That Mao Tse Tung Hour is turning into one big pain in the ass. We're having heavy legal problems with the federal government right now. Two FBI guys turned up in Hackett's office last week and served us with a subpoena. They heard about our Flagstaff bank rip-off film, and they want it. We're getting around that by doing the show in collaboration with the News Division, so Hackett told the FBI to fuck off; we're standing on the First Amendment, freedom of the press, and the
DIANA=>-- Walter thinks we can knock out the misprision of felony charge --
DIANA=>-- but he says absolutely nix on going to series. They'll hit us with inducement and conspiracy to commit a crime --
DIANA=>Christ, it's cold in here -- You see we're paying these nuts from the Ecumenical Liberation Army ten thousand bucks a week to bring in authentic film footage on their revolutionary activities, and that constitutes inducement to commit a crime; and Walter says we'll all wind up in federal prison --
DIANA=>-- I said: "Walter, let the government sue us! We'll take them to the Supreme Court! We'll be front page for months! The Washington Post and the New York Times will be doing two editorials a week about us! We'll have more press than Watergate!"
DIANA=>-- All I need -- is six weeks of federal litigation -- and the Mao Tse Tung Hour -- can start carrying its own time slot!
DIANA=>What's really bugging me now is my daytime programming. NBC's got a lock on daytime with their lousy game shows, and I'd like to bust them. I'm thinking of doing a homosexual soap opera -- The Dykes -- the heart-rending saga of a woman helplessly in love with her husband's mistress. What do you think? --
NARRATOR=>The Mary Ann Gifford pilot movie went on the air March 14th --
NARRATOR=>-- It received a 47 share in its first hour, climbing to a 51 during its second hour --
NARRATOR=>-- showing sustained and increasing audience interest. The network promptly committed to fifteen shows --
NARRATOR=>-- with an option for ten more --
NARRATOR=>-- There were, of course, the usual production difficulties --
WALLIE=>-- "herein called either 'the Production Fee' or 'overhead' equal to twenty percent two-oh (except such percentage shall be thirty percent three-oh for ninety minute or longer television programs --
STEIN=>Where the hell have you been?
MIGGS=>(embracing the
GREAT KHAN)=>Ahmed, sweet, that dodo you sent for a driver couldn't find this fucking place.
STEIN=>Let's get on with this before they raid this place, and we all wind up in the joint.
ED=>We're on Schedule A, page seven, small c small i --
MIGGS=>Have we settled that sub-licensing thing? We want a clear definition here. Gross proceeds should consist of all funds the sublicensee receives not merely the net amount remitted after payment to sublicensee or distributor.
STEIN=>We're not sitting still for over- head charges as a cost prior to distribution.
LAUREEN=>Don't fuck with my distribution costs! I'm getting a lousy two- fifteen per segment, and I 'm already deficiting twenty-five grand a week with Metro. I'm paying William Morris ten percent off the top! (indicates the
GREAT KHAN)=>-- And I'm giving this turkey ten thou a segment and another five for this fruitcake -- And, Helen, don't start no shit with me about a piece again! I'm paying Metro twenty percent of all foreign and Canadian distribution, and that's after recoupment! The Communist Party's not going to see a nickel out of this goddam show until we go into syndication!
MIGGS=>Come on, Laureen, you've got the party in there for seventy-five hundred a week production expenses.
LAUREEN=>I'm not giving this pseudo in- surrectionary sectarian a piece of my show! I'm not giving him script approval! And I sure as shit ain't cutting him in on my distribution charges I
MARY ANN GIFFORD=>Fuggin fascist! Have you seen the movies we took at the San Marino jail break-out demonstrating the rising up of a seminal prisoner- class infrastructure!
LAUREEN=>You can blow the seminal prisoner- class infrastructure out your ass! I'm not knocking down my goddam distribution charges!
THE GREAT KHAN=>Man, give her the fucking over- head clause.
STEIN=>How did I get here? Who's going to believe this? I'm sitting here in a goddam farm in Encino at ten o'clock at night negotiating over- head charges with cowboys!
THE GREAT KHAN=>Let's get to page twenty-two, five, small a, subsidiary rights.
LENNIE=>Where are we now?
WALLIE=>Page twenty-two, middle of the page, subsidiary rights -- "As used herein, 'subsidiary rights' means, without limitation, any and all rights with respect to theatrical motion picture rights, radio broadcasting, legiti- mate stage performances, printed publications and/or any other uses of a similar or dissimilar nature --
SALES MANAGER=>-- Millard Villanova, Sales Manager, KGIM, Boise -- my wife, here, Maureen --
DIANA=>My pleasure --
SALES MANAGER=>I just want to tell you we saw your great stuff this afternoon, Di -- it was great --
DIANA=>Great, Millard --
CHANEY=>-- Over the past two days, you've all had opportunity to meet Diana Christenson, our Vice President in charge of programming. This afternoon, you all saw some of the stuff she's set up for the new season --
CHANEY=>You all know she's the woman behind the Howard Beale show. We know she's beautiful. We know she's brainy. I just think, before we start digging into our Chateau- briands, we ought to let her know how we feel about her --
DIANA=>We've got the number one show in television! And, at next year's affiliates' meeting, I'll be standing here telling you we've got the top five!
DIANA=>Last year, we were the number four network -- next year, we're number one!
DIANA=>It is exactly seven o'clock here in Los Angeles. And right now over a million homes using television in this city are turning their dials to channel 3-- and that's our channel!
ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and gentlemen! -- let's hear it! -- how do you feel?! --
STUDIO AUDIENCE=>We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take this any more!
STUDIO ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and gentlemen -- the mad prophet of the airways -- Howard Beale!
HOWARD=>All right, listen to me! Listen carefully! This is your goddam life I'm talking about today! In this country, when one company takes over another company, they simply buy up a controlling share of the stock. But first they have to file notice with the government. That's how C.C. and A. -- the Communications Corporation of America -- bought up the company that owns this network. And now somebody's buying up C.C. and A! Some company named Western World Funding Corporation is buying up C.C. and A! They filed their notice this morning! Well, just who the hell is Western World Funding Corporation? It's a consortium of banks and insurance companies who are not buying C.C. and A. for themselves but as agents for somebody else!
HOWARD=>Well, who's this somebody else? They won't tell you! They won't tell you, they won't tell the Senate, they won't tell the SEC, the FCC, the Justice Department, they won't tell anybody! They say it's none of our business! The hell it ain't! --
HACKETT=>This is Mr. Hackett, do you have a New York call for me? Do you want to turn that down, please --
HOWARD=>Well, I'll tell you who they're buying C.C. and A. for. They're buying it for the Saudi-Arabian Investment Corporation! They're buying it for the Arabs!
HACKETT=>Clarence? Frank Hackett here I How's everything back in New York? How's the good lady? -- -- All right, take it easy, Clarence, I don't know what you're talking about...When?...Clarence, take it easy. The Howard Beale show's just going on out here. You guys get it three hours earlier in New York ... Clarence, take it easy. How the hell could I see it? It's just on now -- Well, when did Mr. Jensen call you?
HOWARD=>-- We know the Arabs control more than sixteen billion dollars in this country! They own a chunk of Fifth Avenue, twenty downtown pieces of Boston, a part of the port of New Orleans, an industrial park in Salt Lake city. They own big hunks of the Atlanta Hilton, the Arizona Land and cattle Company, the Security National Bank in California, the Bank of the Commonwealth in Detroit! They control ARAMCO, so that puts them into Exxon, Texaco and Mobil oil! They're all over - New Jersey, Louisville, St.Louis, Missouri! And that's only what we know about! There's a hell of a lot more we don't know about because all those Arab petro-dollars are washed through Switzerland and Canada and the biggest banks in this country!
HOWARD=>For example, what we don't know about is this C.C.A. deal and all the other C.C.A. deals! Right now, the Arabs have screwed us out of enough American dollars to come back and, with our own money, buy General Motors, IBM, ITT, A T and T, Dupont, U.S. Steel, and twenty other top American companies. Hell, they already own half of England.
HOWARD'=>Now, listen to me, goddammit! The Arabs are simply buying us! They're buying all our land, our whole economy, the press, the factories, financial institutions, the government! They're going to own us! A handful of agas, shahs and emirs who despise this country and everything it stands for -- democracy, freedom, the right for me to get up on television and tell you about it -- a couple of dozen medieval fanatics are going to own where you work, where you live, what you read, what you see, your cars, your bowling alleys, your mortgages, your schools, your churches, your libraries, your kids, your whole life! --
AMUNDSEN=>The son of a bitch is effective all right --
HOWARD=>-- And there's not a single law on the books to stop them! There's only one thing that can stop them -- you! So I want you to get up now. I want you to get out of your chairs and go to the phone. Right now. I want you to go to your phone or get in your car and drive into the Western Union office in town. I want everybody listening to me to get up right now and send a telegram to the White House --
HACKETT=>Oh, God
HOWARD=>By midnight tonight I want a million telegrams in the White House! I want them wading knee-deep in telegrams at the White House! Get up! Right now! And send President Ford a telegram saying: "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more! I don't want the banks selling my country to the Arabs! I want this C.C. and A. deal stopped now! --
HACKETT=>Oh, God --
HOWARD=>I want this C.C. and A. deal stopped now! I want this C.C. and A. deal stopped now!
CHANEY=>Is that it? Does he come back later in the show?
TECHNICIAN=>That's it. This is one of those shows he just zonks out.
CHANEY=>Do you want to see any more, Frank? All right, turn it off --
AMUNDSEN=>Do you want to go to your office?
CHANEY=>Look, could we have the room?
TECHNICIAN=>Sure.
AMUNDSEN=>Well, I'd like to see a typescript and run it a couple of more times, but I don't think he said anything seriously actionable. But, as for this whole C.C. and A. deal with the Saudis, you'd know a lot more about that than I would, Frank, is it true?
HACKETT=>Yes. C.C. and A. has two billions in loans with the Saudis, and they hold every pledge we've got. We need that Saudi money bad. A disaster. This show is a disaster, an unmitigated disaster, the death knell. I'm ruined, I'm dead, I'm finished.
CHANEY=>Maybe we're overstating Beale's clout with the public.
HACKETT=>An hour ago, Clarence McElheny called me from New York. It was ten o'clock in the East, and our people in the White House report they were already knee-deep in telegrams. By tomorrow morning, they'll be suffocating in telegrams.
CHANEY=>Well, can the government stop the deal?
HACKETT=>They can hold it up. The SEC could hold this deal up for twenty years if they wanted to. I'm finished. Any second that phone's going to ring and Clarence McElheny's going to tell me Mr. Jensen wants me in his office tomorrow morning so he can personally chop my head off.
HACKETT=>Four hours ago, I was the sun God at C.C. and A., Mr. Jensen's hand- picked golden boy, the heir apparent. Now I'm a man without a corporation!
DIANA=>Let's get back to Howard Beale. You're not seriously going to pull Beale off the air.
HACKETT=>Mr. Jensen is unhappy with Howard Beale and wants him discontinued.
DIANA=>He may be unhappy, but he isn't stupid enough to withdraw the number one show on television out of pique.
HACKETT=>Two billion dollars isn't pique! That's the wrath of God! And the wrath of God wants Howard Beale fired!
DIANA=>What for? Every other network will grab him the minute he walks out the door. He'll be back on the air for ABC tomorrow. And we'll lose twenty points in audience share in the first week, roughly a forty million loss in revenues for the year.
HACKETT=>I'm going to kill Howard Beale! I'm going to impale the son of a bitch with a sharp stick through the heart!
DIANA=>And let's not discount federal action by the Justice Department. If C.C. and A. pulls Beale off the air as an act of retribution, that's a flagrant violation of network autonomy and an egregious breach of the consent decree.
HACKETT=>I'll take out a contract on him. I'll hire professional killers. I'll do it myself. I'll strangle him with a sashcord.
DIANA=>No, I don't think Jensen is going to fire anybody. He's sitting up there in his office surrounded by lawyers and senior vice presidents, and right about now, they've begun to realize the extraordinary impact of television. That impact can be focused, manipulated, utilized. If Howard Beale can hurt them, he can help them.
HACKETT=>Hackett -- Yes, Clarence, I've already booked my flight ... Well, can you give me a little more time than that? I've got the red-eye flight, I won't be back in New York till six tomorrow morning ... That'll be just fine. I'll see you then --
HACKETT=>Mr. Jensen wants to meet Howard Beale personally. He wants Mr. Beale in his office at ten o'clock tomorrow morning --
HOWARD=>The final revelation is at hand! I have seen the shattering fulgurations of ultimate clarity! The light is impending! I bear witness to the light!
JENSEN=>Good afternoon, Mr. Beale. They tell me you're a madman.
HOWARD=>Only desultorily.
JENSEN=>How are you now?
HOWARD=>I'm as mad as a hatter.
JENSEN=>Who isn't? Don't sit down. I'm taking you to our conference room which seems more seemly a setting for what I have to say to you.
JENSEN=>I started as a salesman, Mr. Beale. I sold sewing machines and automobile parts, hair brushes and electronic equipment. They say I can sell anything. I'd like to try and sell something to you --
JENSEN=>Valhalla, Mr. Beale, please sit down --
JENSEN=>You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and I won't have it, is that clear?! You think you have merely stopped a business deal -- that is not the case! The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back. It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity, it is ecological balance! You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations! There are no peoples! There are no Russians. There are no Arabs! There are no third worlds! There is no West! There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multi-variate, multi-national dominion of dollars! petro-dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars!, Reichmarks, rubles, rin, pounds and shekels! It is the international system of currency that determines the totality of life on this planet! That is the natural order of things today! That is the atomic, subatomic and galactic structure of things today! And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature, and you will atone! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little twenty- one inch screen, and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT and A T and T and Dupont, Dow, Union Carbide and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state -- Karl Marx? They pull out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories and minimax solutions and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably deter- mined by the immutable by-laws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale! It has been since man crawled out of the slime, and our children, Mr. Beale, will live to see that perfect world in which there is no war and famine, oppression and brutality -- one vast and ecumenical holding
HOWARD=>Why me?
JENSEN=>Because you're on television, dummy. Sixty million people watch you every night of the week, Monday through Friday.
HOWARD=>I have seen the face of God!
JENSEN=>You just might be right, Mr. Beale.
NARRATOR=>That evening, Howard Beale went on the air to preach the corporate cosmology of Arthur Jensen.
HOWARD=>Last night, I got up here and asked you people to stand up and fight for your heritage, and you did and it was beautiful. Six million telegrams were received at the White House. The Arab takeover of C.C. and A. has been stopped. The people spoke, the people won. It was a radiant eruption of democracy. But I think that was it, fellers. That sort of thing isn't likely to happen again. Because, in the bottom of all our terrified souls, we all know that democracy is a dying giant, a sick, sick dying, decaying political concept, writhing in its final pain.
NARRATOR=>It was a perfectly admissible argument that Howard Beale advanced in the days that followed; it was, however, also a very tedious and depressing one. By the end of the first week in June --
NARRATOR=>-- the Howard Beale show had dropped one point in the ratings, and its trend of shares dipped under forty- eight for the first time since last November --
DIANA=>-- You're his goddam agent, Lew!, I'm counting on you to talk some sense into the lunatic!
DIANA=>We're starting to get rumbles from the agencies. Another couple of weeks of this, and the sponsors will be bailing out! ... This is breach of contract, Lew! This isn't the Howard Beale we signed. You better get him off this corporate universe kick or, so help me, I'll pull him off the air! ... I told him, Lew! I've been telling him every day for a week! I'm sick of telling him! Now, you tell him!
HOWARD=>-- Well, the time has come to say: is dehumanization such a bad word? Because good or bad, that's what's so. The whole world is becoming humanoid, creatures that look human but aren't. The whole world, not just us. We're just the most advanced country, so we're getting there first --
HOWARD=>-- The whole world's people are becoming mass-produced, programmed, wired, insensate things useful only to produce and consume other mass-produced things, all of them as unnecessary and useless as we are --
MAX=>I'm sorry I'm late --
HOWARD=>-- that's the simple truth you have to grasp, that human existence is an utterly futile and purposeless thing --
DIANA=>Barbara? Diana --
HOWARD=>-- because once you've grasped that, then the whole universe becomes orderly and comprehensible --
DIANA=>Listen, I had another howling session with Howard Beale today, and he's impenetrable. We better start shoring up the dykes --
HOWARD=>-- We are right now living in what has to be called a corporate society, a corporate world, a corporate universe. This world quite simply is a vast cosmology of small corporations orbiting around larger corporations who, in turn, revolve around giant corporations --
DIANA=>Jesus Christ --
HOWARD=>-- and this whole, endless, ultimate cosmology is expressly designed for the production and consumption of useless things --
DIANA=>Let's start looking around for possible replacements. I hear ABC's grooming a mad prophet of their own in Chicago as our com- petition for next season. See if you can get a tape on him. Maybe we can steal him. And let's start building up the other segments on the show. Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim Webbing. The Vox Populi segment is catching on; let's make that a daily feature --
DIANA=>You know, you could help me out with Howard if you wanted to. He listens to you. You're his best friend --
MAX=>I'm tired of this hysteria about Howard Beale!
DIANA=>Every time you see somebody in your family, you come back in one of these morbid middle-aged moods!
MAX=>And I'm tired of finding you on the goddamned phone every time I turn around! I'm tired of being an accessory in your life!
MAX=>-- and I'm tired of pretending to write this dumb book about my maverick days in those great early years of television! Every execu- tive fired from a network in the last twenty years has written this dumb book about the great early days But don't worry about me. I'll manage. I always have, always will. I'm more concerned about you. Once I go, you'll be back in the eye of your own desolate terrors. Fifty dollar studs and the nightly sleepless contemplation of suicide. You're not the boozer type, so I figure a year, maybe two before you crack up or jump out your fourteenth floor office window.
DIANA=>Stop selling, Max. I don't need you.
DIANA=>I don't want your paint I don't want your menopausal decay and death! I don't need you, Max.
MAX=>You need me badly! I'm your last contact with human reality! I love you, and that painful, decaying menopausal love is the only thing between you and the shrieking nothingness you live the rest of the day!
DIANA=>Then don't leave me!
MAX=>It's too late, Diana! There's nothing left in you that I can live with! You're one of Howard's humanoids, and, if I stay with you, I'll be destroyed! Like Howard Beale was destroyed! Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed! Like everything you and the institution of television touch is destroyed! You are television incarnate, Diana, indifferent to suffering, insensitive to joy. All of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality. War, murder, death are all the same to you as bottles of beer. The daily business of life is a corrupt comedy. You even shatter the sensations of time and space into split-seconds and instant replays. You are madness, Diana, virulent madness, and everything you touch dies with you. Well, not me! Not while I can still feel pleasure and pain and love!
MAX=>It's a happy ending, Diana. Wayward husband comes to his senses, returns to his wife with whom he has built a long and sustaining love. Heartless young woman left alone in her arctic desolation. Music up with a swell. Final commercial. And here are a few scenes from next week's show.
CHANEY=>How'd it go?
HACKETT=>Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the idea of taking Howard Beale off the air. Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale is bringing a very important message to the American people, so he wants Howard Beale on the air. And he wants him kept on.
HACKETT=>Mr. Jensen feels we are being too catastrophic in our thinking. I argued that television was a volatile industry in which success and failure were determined week by week. Mr. Jensen said he did not like volatile industries and suggested with a certain sinister silkiness that volatility in business usually reflected bad management. He didn't really care if Howard Beale was the number one show in television or the fiftieth. He didn't really care if the Beale Show lost money. The network should be stabilized so that it can carry a losing show and still maintain an overall profit. Mr. Jensen has an important message he wants conveyed to the American people, and Howard Beale is conveying it. He wants Howard Beale on the air, and he wants him kept on. I would describe his position on this as inflexible. Where does that put us, Diana?
DIANA=>That puts us in the shithouse, that's where that puts us. Do you want me to go through this?
HACKETT=>Yes
DIANA=>I have an advance TVQ report here. The Beale show Q score, which was forty-seven in the May book, is down to thirty-three and falling. Most of this loss occurred in the child and teen and eighteen-thirty-four categories, which were our core markets. NBC Nightly News, by contrast, has gone up to a twenty-nine Q, and, at this rate, will pass us by the end of July. Everybody here knows the Neilsen and share-trend scores. Let me just capsulate our own AR demographic reports which have been extensive. It is the AR department's carefully considered judgment -- and mine -- that if we get rid of Beale, we should be able to maintain a very respectable share in the high twenties, possibly thirty, with a comparable Q level. The other segments on the Beale show -- Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim Webbing, the Vox Populi -- have all developed their own audiences. Our AR reports show without exception that it is Howard Beale that's the destructive force here. Minimally, we are talking about a ten point differential in shares. I think Joe ought to spell it out for us. Joe?
DONNELLY=>A twenty-eight share is eighty- thousand dollar minutes, and I think we could sell complete positions on the whole. As a matter of fact, we're just getting into the pre-Christmas gift-sellers, and I'll tell you the agencies are coming back to me with four dollar CPMs. If that's any indication, we're talking forty, forty-five million dollar loss in annual revenues.
THACKERAY=>You guys want to hear all the flak I'm getting from the affiliates?
HACKETT=>We know all about it, Herb.
AMUNDSEN=>And you would describe Mr. Jensen's position on Beale as inflexible?
HACKETT=>Intractable and adamantine.
CHANEY=>So what're we going to do about this Beale son of a bitch?
HACKETT=>I suppose we'll have to kill him.
HACKETT=>I don't suppose you have any ideas on that, Diana.
DIANA=>Well, what would you fellows say to an assassination? --
AMUNDSEN'S VOICE=>Well, if Beale dies, what would be our continuing obligation to the Beale corporation? I know our contract with Beale contains a buy- out clause triggered by his death or incapacity --
HACKETT'S VOICE=>There must be a formula for the computation of the purchase price.
AMUNDSEN'S VOICE=>Offhand, I think it was based on a multiple of 1975 earnings with the base period in 1975. I think it was fifty percent of salary plus twenty-five percent of the first year's profits --
AMUNDSEN=>-- multiplied by the unexpired portion of the contract. I don't think the show has any substantial syndication value, would you say, Diana?
DIANA=>Syndication profits are minimal.
CHANEY'S VOICE=>We're talking about a capital crime here, so the network can't be implicated.
AMUNDSEN'S VOICE=>I hope you don't have any hidden tape machines in this office, Frank --
ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it -- how do you feel?
AUDIENCE AND THE KHAN=>We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take this any more!
ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and gentlemen! The Network News Hour! With Sybil the Sooth- sayer, Jim Webbing and his It's- the-Emmes-Truth Department, Miss Mata Hari, tonight another segment of Vox Populi, and starring --
ANNOUNCER=>-- the mad prophet of the airways, Howard Beale!
HACKETT=>Well, the issue is: shall we kill Howard Beale or not. I'd like to hear some more opinions on that --
DIANA=>I don't see we have any option, Frank. Let's kill the son of a bitch.
NARRATOR=>This was the story of Howard Beale who was the network news anchorman on UBS-TV, the first known instance of a man being killed because he had lousy ratings.
