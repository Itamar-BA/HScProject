SNACKS=>all over the room, and it’s obvious there hasn’t been much studying going on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.
GIRL.=>She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.
“O”=>as she’s suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright. She continues
HOUSE=>with a small covered parkway for a garage. She gets out of her car, closes the door. She stares at the house, unmoving.
PAPER=>on Tomoko’s desk flutters in the breeze. Asakawa walks towards it, picks it up. It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop. The developed photos have yet to be claimed.
PICTURE=>obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely round personages. She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.
CLOCK.=>It’s about seven minutes after 7 P.M.
DOORBELL,=>but the door has already opened from within. Asakawa leans out, holding the door open for him. Neither of them speaks. Wordlessly, Ryuji enters the apartment.
TV,=>ejects the tape from the deck.
BAG=>filled with groceries.
ASAKAWA=>You mean that Tomoko—
BUSINESS=>SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO. A BANNER hangs above the stage, which reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.
RYUJI=>Please. Take us out.
DOOR=>just short of a slam. CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone. She half- runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring blankly into space. Ryuji slides into the driver’s seat, buckles his SEATBELT.
SOUND=>like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber. It is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair. CUT to a shot of Asakawa’s face. Far from being frightened, her features are oddly placid. She regards the fearsome thing before her with an almost tender look. Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long hair.
