INSIDE THE POLICE CAR=>Grace has Emma’s head buried in her chest.
ETHAN=>A truck, an SUV ...
GRACE=>Where are we going? ETHAN
DWIGHT=>What! Are you crazy?
DWIGHT=>You cut me slack?! RUTH
33A INSIDE THE BATHROOM=>Grace sits on the edge of the bath, listening to the ring of a cellphone, then a woman’s voice, a faint hello.

ETHAN=>No. to let them go.
54A=>EXT. RESERVATION ROAD. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON Ethan’s car pulls up. As he walks away from it we see he is at Reservation Road Now in the afternoon sunlight, autumn trees, under a clear sky. He walks the road, sees a softball square, an old cemetery. He wanders to the gas station. He stands by the gas pumps, staring up the road. Trying to force himself to see clues he missed.
FUNERAL DIRECTOR=>Some people prefer to have a place in a garden of remembrance to visit, care for. Others prefer cremation so that they can perhaps release the ashes in a favorite place ...
ETHAN=>Let’s take him to the shore.
RAUL=>Signora Grace, you were to meet us at the Greer house. GRACE
GRACE=>He’s taking our daughter to school. What is ...
SERGEANT BURKE=>Yeah he said he’d be here.
SERGEANT BURKE=>Coffee would be great, I never feel human ‘til my sixth cup.
SERGEANT BURKE=>Josh suffered a sharp blow to the rib cage which fractured several ribs, and unfortunately drove one into his heart. He died instantly, no pain.
SERGEANT BURKE=>It helps us narrow the field somewhat. We’re still working on the headlight glass and we’re canvasing the area. On Sunday we intend to set up checkpoints at the time of the accident. Question drivers who may have passed.
ETHAN=>What does depending on the circumstances mean?
ON SCREEN:=>The screen flickers through: Deadlyroads.com., pages related to stats., statue of limitations, victims photos. Grace comes in, kisses him.

DWIGHT=>She doesn’t know what she wants. One minute it’s ... STEVE
STEVE=>You get the check, I pay you enough.
DAY=>PARENTS and CHILDREN mill around. Above a folding table with school printed programs. A SIGN announces “SCHOOL CONCERT - 7:00 PM. ADMISSION FREE.” CLOSE on Ethan, head down, forging through, as Grace acknowledges nod, smiles. Ethan is on ahead now - a distance between them.
NIGHT=>Rows of folding chairs. At the front a piano, a piano stool, and music stand occupy a low makeshift stage. As people take their seats. Ruth Wheldon adjusts the height of the music stand.

GERRY EDELSTEIN=>Why did kamikaze pilots wear helmets?
LUCAS=>What do you get if you cross poison ivy with four leaf clover.
GERRY EDELSTEIN=>Pass. Two part question. What do you call a deer with no eyes?
GRACE=>Ethan, where are you going?
ETHAN=>You were marvellous.
ETHAN=>Have you been here before?
DWIGHT=>Well I guess there’s no way of knowing for sure?
ETHAN=>Only the killer knows, and he’s not going to talk.
ETHAN=>Would you? Knowing he’ll get a slap on the wrist.
RUTH=>What do you mean?
DWIGHT=>You know I’m sorry.
ETHAN=>Tell your son I said he has a big future in comedy. RUTH
RUTH=>No, go right ahead, it’s at the top of the stairs.

TO BLACK=>The bang of the trunk turns into the CRACK of a baseball bat hitting a ball
THE SCOREBOARD=>The scoreboard shows the game tied 4-4 in the bottom of the 9th. CLOSE IN on a DWIGHT and LUCAS in box seats on the third base line. LUCAS has his chin just above the railing and his hands clenched into fists, YELLING himself hoarse.
LUCAS=>Yeah! Dad, didya see that? Didya, Dad?
LUCAS=>No, I was checking the time. You wanna hear a joke?
FLASH FORWARD=>TO:
ETHAN=>AaaHH!
DAWN=>Ethan’s still there, weeping with grief, exhaustion. The dog barks, a light comes on, Grace emerges. He looks round at her, puts his hand out, she takes it, sits beside him, he puts his arm around her.
