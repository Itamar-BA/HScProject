COLETTE.=>A voice calls from down the corridor - her mother SIDO.
COLETTE=>What time is it?
WILLY=>My God! Here...
MME. DE CAILLAVET=>Delighted. Well, astonished actually. You have caught the slipperiest eel... How does one do that?
WILLY=>Pierre. Let me introduce you to my wife, Gabrielle. VEBER
SCHWOB=>They may look grand and intimidating. But just imagine them perched over a chamber pot. Each and every one of them.
VEBER=>Willy. Schwob.
COLETTE=>You’ve married a country girl. Not a penny to her name.
COLETTE=>...Goodbye Willy.
SEQUENCE=>CLOSE ON A PANE OF GLASS It is greenish, uneven, and mottled. Using a tiny pair of scissors, a hand is etching the letter “W.” INT. LA MASCOTTE - NIGHT Willy, Colette, Schwob, Veber and a COQUETTE, are finishing up a meal, drinking champagne. Willy is regaling them with an anecdote as he pays the bill with a roll of notes. INT. THEATRE - NIGHT As Willy walks down the aisle toward his seat, he is in his element. He nods acknowledgements and greetings to everybody who is anybody. Colette follows a couple of steps behind. INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE ROOM - DAY We see the etching progress - W I L. The creator is none other than Colette, alone, absorbed in this labor of love. INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY Colette starts pulling sheets off old furniture in the living room and opening up the blinds. INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT In bed together, Willy is reading the evening paper as Colette nuzzles into his chest. He indicates a cartoon drawing - of himself with his trademark top hat - that Colette finds amusing. INT. ENTRANCE ROOM - DAY Colette completes the etching of W I L L Y on the kitchen window, taking a moment to admire her handiwork. MUSIC
ENDS.=>EXT. RUE JACOB - AFTERNOON Colette walks towards home, turns into the courtyard and collects the mail. INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM She enters, already opening the envelope and walks through the house perusing the letter - that is written in green ink.
WILLY=>I really don’t!
COLETTE=>No. Not at all.
COLETTE=>No, not really. WILLY
COLETTE=>I’m being serious.
WILLY=>I bet she did.
WILLY=>It’s expected.
EVENING=>From directly above, we see Willy trudging upstairs. INT. BEDROOM - LATE EVENING Moments later, a rather tipsy Willy enters the bedroom. Colette is in bed, her eyes wide open.
HALF AN HOUR LATER=>Willy emerges with the books. Colette is on the sofa with the dog, a novel open in front of her. He smiles, congratulatory but awkward. COLETTE
COLETTE=>You don’t like it?
WILLY=>Yes. The nature descriptions are... charming. COLETTE
SCHWOB=>I didn’t really have a choice. It was simply... There. COLETTE
WILLY.”=>INT. MADAME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON – DAY Rachilde is reading her own review out loud to a crowd that includes Willy.
COLETTE=>Where’re we going?
WILLY=>You’ll find out.
COLETTE=>It was only Ollendorff. He’s your publisher, Willy.
WILLY=>What’s that one? COLETTE
WILLY=>Give me a kiss.
WILLY=>I got an advance from Ollendorff. 25,000 Francs.
WILLY=>This is it? Your total output for all these weeks?
LET ME OUT!!=>Bastard...absolute...arrogant bastard! I’ll write the bloody book! And I’ll tell them it was me! Me! Me who wrote it! Bastard! I’ll tell them! Claudine is mine! Mine!
GEORGIE=>Are you sure now?
WILLY=>Yes, of course.
COLETTE=>What a nice place. GEORGIE
COLETTE=>Like an alligator. They smile and kiss again. INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - MORNING Willy is perusing the morning mail. He hears the sound of Colette entering and, affecting nonchalance, carries on reading.
WILLY=>Of course not.
COLETTE=>I’m planning on killing Renaud off in the next one. WILLY
WILLY=>She’s not bad.
COLETTE=>She’s terrible.
COLETTE=>Willy, I hate it.
COLETTE=>She butchered me. I look ten years older. You made me do this.
WILLY=>Oh come now, you went along with it... you always do.
POLAIRE=>Monsieur Willy! She is deposited before...
WITH... NEWSPAPER HEADLINES=>“CLAUDINE SENSATION” “MENAGE A TROIS” “VIVE CLAUDINE”
CLOSE ON POSTER=>It says “Do Not Go and See CLAUDINE IN PARIS - it’s immoral.”
MAGAZINE HEADLINE “THE YEAR OF CLAUDINE!”=>INT. STREET - DAY
CLAUDINE! CLAUDINE! CLAUDINE!=>The merriment in the room is sky high.
WILLY=>Who is the one I admire? Who is the queen of desire? And who has set Paris on fire? CLAUDINE! CLAUDINE! CLAUDINE!
MEG=>It’s my favorite book.
MISSY=>Congratulations, by the way. It seems that Claudines are everywhere these days.
MISSY=>Good for her.
MISSY=>You should own up to it.
COLETTE=>Someone told you?
COLETTE=>What do you mean?
WILLY=>Yes, I’m ready.
HEON=>Hello Colette.
WILLY=>Out of the question. Ollendorff will never agree.
COLETTE=>Ollendorff or you?
COLETTE=>Godammit Willy..!
THEY KISS.=>The house EXPLODES. People are on their feet, yelling and booing. A barrage of food and glasses are thrown onto the stage, smashing around the embracing couple - even a footstool, which Colette narrowly dodges. The curtain falls.
COLETTE=>He was...“was”...
COLETTE=>Willy - not today.
COLETTE=>But...I still...
WAGUE=>You’ll survive.
WILLY=>How much then?
MISSY=>Yes. I’m sorry.
MANAGER=>You degenerates!
MISSY=>Please fuck off. Oh bugger off.
COLETTE=>Do you never stop?
WILLY=>Oh yes! How sad.
COLETTE=>No, you haven’t.
MOMENTS LATER=>The nib of a pen is dipped in ink. On the opposite page from the end of Claudine, Colette writes “NOTES ON THE MUSIC HALL.” She starts to write again - we hear a new authority in her voice.
