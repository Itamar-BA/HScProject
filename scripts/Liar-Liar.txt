FLETCHER=>Well, for once I agree with the prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client.
FLETCHER=>Instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower!
AUDREY=>
FFLLEETTCCHHEERR//DDAANN GGEEOORRGGEE=>TThhee bbooyy mmuusstt lleeaarrnn tthhee wwaayy ooff tthhee wwaarrrriioorr.. AAnndd wwhhoo bbeetttteerr to teach him than Rowdy Rod- . Piper and Big John Stud?
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE=>He must be schooled in the way of the face-claw, the sleeper- hold, and the purple nuxple. For only then--
JERRY=>
FRED=>I can't do it.
FLETCHER=>
FLETCHER=>Damn! I completely forgot.
GRETA=>Court's closed.
AUDREY=>Are you alright?
AUDREY=>Max's birthday?
FLETCHER=>
AUDREY=>C'mon, honey. It can be anything-- whatever you want most in the world.
FLETCHER=>"I've had better?"
FLETCHER=>"I've had better?!"
JUDGE STEVENS=>Fine, fine. And for the record, the reason is?
FLETCHER=>It certainly does.
FLETCHER=>Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid.
FLETCHER=>LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA!!
FLETCHER=>
FLETCHER=>
FLETCHER=>How about that. I really do.
POLICE OFFICER=>May I see your driver's license?
AUDREY=>Where's your car?
FLETCHER=>
FLETCHER {CONT'D)=>I have an idea. I'll come over tonight, right after court lets out and play with Max. Have him invite some friends over. We'll have a game and everything. Then, you and I can sit down and talk.
FLETCHER=>Well, actually--
MAX=>But you're the only one who makes me feel bad.
MAX=>I have to go.
PHILIP=>
MR. ALLAN=>And thanks for those flowers for my anniversary. My wife loved them.
FLETCHER=>
FLETCHER=>
MALE VISITOR=>Don't worry, you can take it. Oh yeah. That's it. There you go. Yes! Yes!
FLETCHER=>
JUDGE STEVENS=>Splendid. I admire your courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give you a few minutes to compose yourself, and then we'll get started.
FLETCHER=>
FLETCHER=>
FLETCHER=>
VIRGINIA=>
VIRGINIA=>What do you mean?
CONTRACT WITHOUT PARENTAL=>CONSENT INCLUDING--
FLETCHER=>
PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK=>YOU VERY LITTLE! This contract is void!!! The fact that my client gets nailed more often than a two-by-four is irrelevant. Standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty-seven point three-nine- five million dollars!!
FLETCHER=>This woman --my client -- goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar! And now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too?
JUDGE STEVENS=>Mr. Reid, you are out of order!
GOOD! I'M CONTEMPTIBLE! MY=>WHOLE GODDAMN LIFE IS JUST ONE BIG FAT FIB! YOU LIKE MY HAIR? --
CCAAPPPPEEDD!! FFIIVVEE--NNIINNEETTYY AA=>CHICKLET!!
FLETCHER=>
SECURITY GUARD=>Whoa, where do you think you're going?
FLETCHER=>MAX?!! AUDREYY?!!
MAX=>Mom, it's dad!
