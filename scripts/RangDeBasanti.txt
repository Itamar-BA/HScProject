VOICE=>If yet your blood does not boil, then it is water that flows in your veins. For what is the flush of youth if it is not of service to the motherland. —Dushyant Kumar
BHAGAT SINGH=>Just a minute, Mr. McKinley. One revolutionary is meeting another!
BHAGAT SINGH=>Thank you... Shall we go?
BHAGAT SINGH=>This isn’t the end Mr. McKinley. This is just the beginning. There will be others after we’re gone, many others.
HOTEL TOUT=>Step back, she is my customer!
CAB DRIVER=>Get out of the way. Scoot!
SUE=>Yes!
SUE=>Of course I am here. But sorry you had to make arrangements at such short notice.
SONIA=>Your Hindi has really improved!
SONIA=>Hey Sue, no need to worry. Everything has been taken care of. Posters have been put up everywhere. It’s also been announced on radio. Let’s see how many turn up for the auditions.
SONIA=>What’s wrong?
SUE=>I didn’t tell you. The truth is that I’ve come alone. No money, no producer is going to turn up...
SONIA=>I know.
SUE=>You knew it?
SONIA=>After Alice, there was a call from Beth Williams. She informed me of the cancellation of the show and also my services...did you abuse her in Hindi? She wanted to know what it meant. I explained to her in graphic detail.
SUE=>You are amazing, Sonia.
CAB DRIVER=>This is Delhi University.
SONIA=>How much?
CAB DRIVER=>Ma’am, I’ve already told you.
SONIA=>Please get all the luggage upstairs.
SUE=>OK.
SONIA=>Get some rest now. I’ll see you tomorrow. If you need anything, you have my number. Let’s go Ravi.
SUE=>Thanks.
SUE=>Grandpa was right. You fall in love with India at first sight.
SONIA=>Don’t sing. Just recite Mataram’.
SONIA=>Raise your hands and say ‘Vande Mataram!’
SONIA=>Say it loudly...‘Vande Mataram’!
SONIA=>Tea!
SONIA=>None work, right?
SUE=>One or two of them can be used for minor roles, but no one’s even close for Azad or Bhagat Singh.
SONIA=>You’re right. I guess it’s all my fault
SUE=>No, Sonia, you’re my rock.
SONIA=>Sue, there’s no point feeling sad. Let’s go and have some fun.
SUE=>Not in the mood, Sonia.
SONG: PAATHSHALA=>Lose control...I’m a rebel No students here, No teachers here, Here’s to our kind of school, Having fun, breaking rules...
SONIA=>O poet of poets… what’s up?
SONIA=>How’re you buddy?
ASLAM=>I’m good. What about you?
SUE=>You study at the University?
ASLAM=>Wow! Her Hindi is great. We live there, eat there, but no one has ever accused us of studying there... right, Sonia?
SONG: PAATHSHALA=>Where every face is a book that we read. Both your and my face is our mobile library Friendship is a lesson on equations. Love teaches us multiplication. The one who wins hearts is the true alpha and beta. Lose control...one more time Lose lose lose control... I’m a rebel!
SUE=>What are those madcaps upto?
SONIA=>That’s DJ.
DJ/SUKHI=>Let’s rock it.

SONIA=>That’s his natural state.
DJ=>Sukhi, all parts working?
SONIA=>DJ...
DJ=>Whoa! Whoa! Who is this?
SUE=>Hi!
SONIA=>DJ...
DJ=>Sue... What kind of a name is this? She’s so pink...her name should be Gulabo .
DJ=>She’s quite hot...perfect for this cold.
SUKHI=>Karan, you saved my life! I love you!
SUKHI=>Aslam, you too saved my life. I love you too!
ASLAM=>It’s OK...
SUKHI=>I’m ok... You must have saved my life too...
ASLAM=>No! Sukhi! She didn’t save your life.
SUKHI=>No problem. One day definitely save my life.
DJ=>Relax bro! She is your sister-in-law.
SONG: PAATHSHALA=>Getting tipsy and toppling over taught us gravity. Doing our practicals in love gave us clarity. The quietness is a midget. The noise that looms large is more Every heart is bubbling over with
H2SO4=>No one’s learnin’, no one’s teachin’ - 2 Our classroom is just about chillin’ - 2 I’m a rebel! Lose control...
KARAN=>Sukhi, you just sit and watch like a dumb-ass...DJ doesn’t waste a second.
SUKHI=>He’s a stud.
RAHUL=>Hi! How’s everybody?
KARAN=>Hi Rahul! What’s up?
RAHUL=>Got a few gigs lined up.
ASLAM=>How’s your radio thing going?
RAHUL=>What radio thing? I’m a radio jockey...
KARAN=>Did anything work out?
RAHUL=>All India Radio has given me a night slot.
KARAN=>Cool.
RAHUL=>Not really. When the whole world’s asleep, I’m on air.
ASLAM=>But many people stay up late. Lovers, insomniacs, watchmen and idiots!
RAHUL=>Have fun at my expense. What to do? It’s a trial job with zero income.
RAHUL=>Thanks man...thanks a lot. See you guys. Got a cigarette?
ASLAM=>Got fooled again!
KARAN=>Let it be! It’s Dad’s money. It’s lying around gathering dust.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Stop this obscene dance! How many times do I have to make you understand this? Polluting the culture of this country... Leave this place right now. LEAVE !
BOYFRIEND=>Hey, bastard!
LAXMAN PANDEY=>This is your last warning. From now on, no Western music out here. No lewd dancing! Or I’ll break your legs. Is that clear?
ASLAM=>Who are you to warn us? If you don’t like it, don’t come here.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Shut up! You bloody Pakistani!
KARAN=>Let’s finish it.
POLICEMAN=>Come on! Clear out...
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Last warning! Got it? Hail India!
SUKHI=>You touch Aslam and see what I do to you... Even your mother won’t recognise you.
SUB-INSPECTOR=>Ever seen a baboon’s arse? Yours will be as red after I’ve finished with you. Take them to the police station.
DJ=>Sir, I’m sure we can work it out.
SUB-INSPECTOR=>Too much hot blood...messing about in a heritage site!
DJ=>No, never mind. Keep this...
DJ=>Anyone hungry? I’m famished...
DJ=>Shit!
DJ=>Bloody idiot...
AJAY=>How are you?
SONIA=>Had something happened to you, I’d have killed you.
AJAY=>Is this any way to greet your boyfriend? How are you?
SUKHI=>Hey, what’s up?
AJAY=>Great buddy! And you?
AJAY=>Mr. Rathod!
AJAY=>Aslam, you look taller each time.
AJAY=>Stop posing. Come here.
AJAY=>That it is!
ASLAM=>Hurry guys, I’m famished.
MITRO=>You won’t get any food here.
DJ=>Mitro, my sweetheart, how are you?
MITRO=>Stay away! Remembered your mother after two months? I carried you in my stomach for nine months, and washed your bum for years. Now you turn up in these torn clothes, pretending to be a gentleman. Get lost!
MITRO=>Does anyone bother to check if Mitro is alive or dead?
MITRO=>You’re drunk again.
DJ=>First give us food Ma, then yell at us all night.
MITRO=>None of you have eaten? What’s with this generation? And Sonia, you’ve lost even more weight.
SONIA=>Really...Mitro!
MITRO=>The girls of today are more bones than flesh. How will you bear children?
ASLAM=>How will you bear children?
MITRO=>Aslam, how are you my son?
MITRO=>He is my true son who bothers to check on me.
MITRO=>And you useless fellow! Shouldn’t have sent you to the city.
DJ=>Come on...
DJ=>Look ma, what I brought for you. Your daughter-in-law. Her name is Sue.
MITRO=>What? A foreigner?
DJ=>Brought from London. That’s why I was away for so long.
SUE=>Give me your blessings Ma. Your son’s a bit soft in the head.
DJ=>Gosh! She understands Hindi! You really understand everything? What a goof-up...
MITRO=>I’m going off to sleep. Your beds are ready. No need to drive back so late at night.
DJ=>Alright. You don’t worry.
SUE=>I saw them then. Like they’d leapt out of the pages of my grandfather’s diary—Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Rajguru, Durga Bhabhi, Ashfaqullah Khan, —they were sitting there, right in front of me.
ASLAM=>Sue...where are you?
SUE=>Will you guys act in my film?
ASLAM=>What?
SUE=>Will you guys act in my film? You guys are perfect!
SUKHI=>Hey, why are you guys laughing? I’m the hero of her film.
AJAY=>These guys are champions when it comes to acting.
AJAY=>Yeah, clowning around as they do all day.
SUE=>Really. The four of you will be perfect as Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Ashfaqullah Khan and Rajguru. And Sonia will be my Durga Bhabhi.
DJ=>Gosh, she really knows Hindi!
ASLAM=>Come on... All patriotism is boring.
SUE=>Boring? These guys gave their lives for the freedom of your country.
KARAN=>What freedom? Have you seen the state of this country? No one believes this crap.
AJAY=>Excuse me, Karan! I believe in this country, in patriotism. Otherwise, why would I be fighting for it?
KARAN=>Maybe because it’s cool being a pilot... Flying expensive planes, wearing sexy jackets...
SUKHI=>...and women... Women love men in uniform.
AJAY=>Sure... I love being a pilot. Sure it’s cool, but I can give my life for this country... I am proud of this country.
KARAN=>Proud of what? This country’s exploding population?
ASLAM=>Or unemployment?
KARAN=>Or corruption? Which of these are you most proud of?
SUE=>Right.
KARAN=>OK, Ajay you make this country perfect. The minute I get my degree, I’m out of this dump to America.
SONIA=>You won’t be able to leave us and go.
DJ=>She speaks Hindi so well! Why didn’t you tell me, you idiot? I kept making a fool of myself...
SUE=>At least ask them once, please.
SONIA=>You don’t give up, do you...
SONIA=>OK, but nobody will turn up.
DJ=>They’ll turn up. I’ll get them. That’s DJ’s promise.
DJ=>Karan, put out your cigarette.
DJ=>Greetings, Grandpa!
DADAJI=>God bless you. When did you come?
DJ=>Just last night. With some friends.
SUE=>Who is he?
SONIA=>DJ’s grandfather.
MITRO=>Lord, watch over him...
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Good morning Karan. Back so early?
KARAN=>I didn’t know you were in town, Sir.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Just arrived an hour ago. It was a long flight. Everything ok at college?
KARAN=>Everything’s fine, Dad.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Have you decided which American university you want to go to next year? Michigan University offers a fine Management programme. Then Carnegie Mellon, Wharton...
KARAN=>I know the list.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Hello... Wait... I can’t hear you clearly...call me later.

KARAN=>Please, don’t start with your lectures...
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>SMS generation. Any conversation that goes beyond lines becomes a lecture.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Hello...the signal’s weak here...give me a second. Excuse me, Karan.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>What is it?
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>The deal is off then, we are not interested.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Please don’t waste my time. You know Russian quality is doubtful, they can’t afford to be arrogant. Anyway, in the open market, they’d not get anything close to the price we’re offering. They need to make up their minds.
SONIA=>I warned you. They won’t turn up.
SUE=>But DJ promised me.
SONIA=>Oh! But DJ promised me!
KARAN=>So you really are a filmmaker?
SONIA=>Karan...
SONIA=>Why are you so late? And where are the others?
KARAN=>‘The Young Guns of India.’ Very dramatic.
SONIA=>Where are you going?
SUE=>Well, that’s one part cast.
SUE=>I am sure Karan would know where his friends are right now.
SUKHI=>She’s an eight.
DJ=>Wow! Nine!
SUKHI=>What a girl...
SUKHI=>Two.
ASLAM=>Hey Chotu, get me a cup of tea...
DJ=>Six!
SUKHI=>Ten!
ASLAM=>Ten? She looks like a hen.
DJ=>What? Dude...look at those legs! Left Right, Left Right, Tik Tik.
DJ=>Oh shit...
SUKHI=>Don’t be silly, that’s at least an eight.
SONIA=>Thought I’d find you stuffing your faces. You lazy good-for-nothings.
DJ=>We were about to come, but we are waiting for Karan actually.
SUKHI=>Right!
SONIA=>Oh! So you were waiting for Karan? Karan was there on time.
DJ=>We are waiting for him here and he was waiting for us there. What confusion...
SUKHI=>But we were supposed to meet here.
DJ=>Can you believe it?
SUE=>You’re Ashfaqullah Khan. You’re Rajguru.
SUKHI=>The hero, right?
SUE=>And do you know who you are?
SUE=>The master of disguise and deception, Chandrashekhar Azad.
DJ=>Killing me softly!
SUE=>Learn the lines properly. We’ll meet tomorrow.
SONIA=>Eight! Sharp!
SUKHI=>Nine!
SONIA=>8 a.m. sharp!
SUKHI=>Oh that! Fine...
SONIA=>We’ve already wasted a day.
SUKHI=>Hey wait...what...
DJ=>Aslam, your sister-in-law even better when she’s angry...
DJ=>Bitten by the bug of love! No hope of surviving.
MISHRA=>What are you doing, Laxman?
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Greetings, Mishraji.
MISHRA=>is The Party High Command really happy with your work. These demonstrations that you have started against Western culture, they’ve helped us overshadow other parties.
MISHRA=>Come, come... Give. Here. Take this.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Er...for what...
MISHRA=>This is is for your boys, and this is for you Laxman Pandey.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>That’s not necessary, Mishraji. I’m not doing this for money. I really believe in the principles of my party.
MISHRA=>That’s fine, but every movement needs fuel to keep it going.
SUE=>March 14th.We started rehearsals. To say I was nervous would be an understatement.
SUKHI=>‘There is nothing you can do to break me. Because I have made pain my friend. As I hold Death’s fingers.’
SUKHI=>DJ you concentration.
DJ=>Look...death’s finger.
KARAN=>‘I’ve committed my life to the freedom of this country. I know you want me to get married, but I have made freedom my bride. Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh.’ Who talks like this, for God’s sake? ‘Freedom is my bride.’ What’s his problem?
ASLAM=>I think it’s a good line for Sukhi. Since no girl is ever going to marry him, let freedom be his bride...
SUKHI=>Laugh bastards, laugh. You guys are not invited to my wedding.
ASLAM=>Hey, don’t be sentimental...
DJ=>S ue, what have you done to me?
ALL=>The season has changed and the world looks so pretty!
DJ=>This is the sari round of The Miss Freedom contest.
SONIA=>Just thought it would help me get into the character. Idiots!
SUE=>This isn’t going to work. You have to work hard to bring out the characters. Unless you emote from within, you won’t understand these characters. Try, it will come from within you.
DJ=>See, he’s got into his character already. You understood the character pretty fast.
DJ=>like a See! Now you revolutionary! Whatever you say Gulabo, you need me to create the mood.
ASLAM=>DJ, watch it.
DJ=>Now she’s upset!
DJ=>She’s smiling. She’s mine!
SUE=>Those are the words of a 23-year-old. That’s how old Bhagat Singh was when he walked to the gallows—23.
ASLAM=>Those were different times, Sue. Today, if you tell people that you want to give your life for your country, they’ll call you mad.
KARAN=>Exactly. I don’t think I can relate to this...
SUE=>That’s it. Don’t think...feel. Just don’t read the words. Feel them. Let's do it again.
ASLAM=>Why don’t we try again? Come on...
KARAN=>I have committed my life to the freedom of the country...
SUE=>Good!
KARAN=>I’ve committed my life to the freedom of this country. A job, a well settled life—these things don’t matter anymore. I know you want me to get married, but I have made freedom my bride.
SUKHI=>I swear on Mother India...
SUKHI=>I swear on Mother India...
SUKHI=>Damn it!
DJ=>Trust me I won’t let you die a bachelor.
SUKHI=>Promise?
DJ=>It’s DJ’s promise.
ASLAM=>You’ll be changing people’s destinies... You’ll show them the way... You know how to change destinies... Far beyond these lines must you traverse
KARAN=>Hey Pappu, change the channel!
ASLAM=>Your love line is very strong. The man of your dreams will come along in a black T-shirt and say...
DJ=>S ue, what have you done to me?
SUKHI=>Do I even have a love line?
KARAN=>You must have washed it off in the loo.
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI=>‘This is a blatant lie, and a ploy by the opposition to bring down the government. I am ordering a probe.’
KARAN=>This is really depressing. Come on, let’s go...
SONG: BE A REBEL=>Be a rebel
ASLAM=>See you guys tomorrow.
SUKHI=>You’re my buddy. I’ll drop you home.
ASLAM=>Home is just two lanes away. I’ll manage.
SUKHI=>Khalbali khalbali talli gali...
KARAN=>We aren’t so drunk that we have forgotten where you live.
KARAN=>Talli gali...
SUKHI=>Talli gali...
KARAN=>Talli gali...
KARAN=>We aren’t so drunk that we have forgotten where you live.
DJ=>Idiots!
SUE=>You’re very lucky to have friends like them.
DJ=>One day, this will all end. We’ll all go our separate ways.
SUE=>But you can always keep in touch.
DJ=>Doesn’t happen. Life gets busy. Too many problems—getting a job, a house, money. In college, we are the masters of our destinies. But after college, we have to dance to fate’s tune. You know Gulabo, I passed out 5 years ago, but still...
SUE=>I don’t understand.
DJ=>I don’t ever want to leave college...
SUE=>Why?
DJ=>At the campus I’m someone. People know me. DJ’s a somebody. People expect me to do something big in life. But when I’m out on the streets. I’ll just be like the rest of the slobs in this country. Nameless. Faceless. Scared. Just walking the streets...
DJ=>I can’t believe this. It’s all the beer’s fault. Everything came out...
SUE=>Hmm...
DJ=>You know what else I’m scared of? Acting in your film.
SUE=>Don’t worry. You’re in safe hands...
DJ=>Tim lak lak te tim lak lak...
KARAN=>Talli gali...
SUKHI=>My friend is tall but the lane is small...
KARAN=>It’s still Aslam’s lane.
AMANULLAH KHAN=>Where have you been?
SUKHI=>Hello Uncle!
ASLAM=>We’ll catch up tomorrow.
SUKHI=>Aslam...
KARAN=>Come on.
SUKHI=>Talli gali...
AMANULLAH KHAN=>You’ve been drinking as well?
ASLAM=>Father, you know I don’t drink.
AMANULLAH KHAN=>Good-for-nothings.
ASLAM=>Whatever, they’re my friends.
AMANULLAH KHAN=>Friends! They shame standing in front of your father reeking of alcohol. Why can’t you get friends in your own community? Why do you make friends with people who corrupt you...disgrace your religion...
ASLAM=>What does friendship have to do with religion or community, father?
MOINUDDIN=>Shut up! Don’t raise your voice in the presence of your father. He’s right. This country has never accepted Muslims and it never will. How can you be so passive! Do you ever see me friends with a Hindu?
ASLAM=>I’m not you and I don’t want to be like you, brother. I can’t fill myself with so much hate...
MOINUDDIN=>Coward. That’s what you are.
ASLAM’S MOTHER=>Stop it!
ASLAM=>I feel suffocated in this house. It’s the same old thing every single day...
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>Carnivals will be held on martyrs’ graves every year. That will be the most of those who sacrifice their lives for the country.
SOME REVOLUTIONARIES=>Well said, Ashfaq sahab...
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>If only the English were to hear you, they would leave this country immediately.
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>So what has been decided?
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>In eight days, we’ll steal the Empire’s money from the train that passes through Kakori. And with that money we will buy arms. Bismil sahab will explain everything.
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>Bismil…where is my Ram?
SUE=>Where is my Ram?
SUE=>I just can’t find my Ramprasad Bismil.
SONIA=>Relax. We will find him.
SUE=>But where? How?
SONIA=>Oh no...
LAXMAN PANDEY=>You won’t get Ramprasad Bismil out here. You need a true Indian. How can you find Indian revolutionaries amongst people who want to be Westerners?
SONIA=>Ignore him... Let’s go.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Ramprasad Bismil wished to be reborn a hundred times so that he could give his life for his country a hundred times over.
SONIA=>Let’s go, Sue.
SUE=>So where do you think I can find my Bismil?
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Because this day, we walk with death, and laugh at its pale spectre, we will not fear these cruel swords, our courage is far sharper. Mistake not our for submission, for beneath, lies lava, molten.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>O martyrs, O men of valour, I’d give my life for you. In every lane, even the enemy sings your praise these days.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>We will show our mettle when the moment of truth arrives... For courage lives in deeds, not boastful claims.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>We’ve gathered in the enemy’s lair my friend, In the hope of dying for our motherland, We will not fear those cruel swords, our courage is far sharper.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Because this day, we walk with death, and laugh at its pale spectre. We will not fear those cruel swords, our courage is far sharper.
SONIA=>Sue, this isn’t London. You don’t know what kind of scum, men like Laxman Pandey are.
ASLAM=>Look Sue if he is a part of this, then I can’t do the film.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>If you have any problem with me, say it to my face. Don’t stab me in the back like a coward.
DJ=>ikaMs] rw tk b/kj lA ges le>k---
DJ=>Pandey, just leave! We don’t want trouble.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Speak up, you coward.
DJ=>Aslam, sit...where are you going?
LAXMAN PANDEY=>You coward, what were you saying?
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Go on...speak up...
SUKHI=>Hey you! How dare you hit Aslam?
SUE=>Stop it! Please!
SUE=>Karan, stop them!
SUKHI=>Thrash him!
SUE=>I took you guys in my film. God knows what made me come here. I was so stupid to pack my bags and come to a place where people are just looking for an excuse to kill each other. Well…at least now you have one less excuse…
DJ=>You know we’ve got a problem with Pandey. There’s a lot of bad blood.
SUE=>And if I stay, it’s sure to spill.
DJ=>No, Sue. We’ve worked it out. You won’t have any problems. Sue... we all know how much this film means to you. We want to help you finish what you came here to do. Everyone wants you to stay. I want you to stay. Say something...
DJ=>I’m with you now. You’re in safe hands. Come on...get up.
DJ=>She smiles, she’s mine! She’s not going anywhere. Now just chill.
DJ=>Bloody idiot... What a drama... Clean up the room now. What a mess!
SUE=>The next four weeks were the hardest four weeks of my entire life...and the happiest.

SONG: RANG DE BASANTI=>Take some soil of my land, the scent of this gypsy air Add the breath of my being, the drumming of my heart And the passion, that races through every bead of my blood Take all these, and stir it Then watch as it brings out the colour Watch as it brings out the colour of sacrifice, my friend
DJ=>Bismil’s sent a message that the Lucknow the Empire’s money will be looted by us in Kakori while eating Kakori kababs. And we will buy bombs with that money.

DJ=>Hey Shortstuff! Did you get Bismil’s message? No?... Then Listen... The train that’s going to Lucknow will be looted in Kakori in 8 days. It’s loaded with the Empire’s money. Will you loot it?
CHOTU=>No.
CHOTU=>Arms...

DJ=>Bismil has sent a message. The Lucknow train which carries the Empire’s money will be looted by us in seven days, in Kakori. And we will buy bombs with that money.
SONG: RANG DE BASANTI=>Now paint the whole town with it Paint your very being Paint your every vein with it Paint it with a smile Paint those childhood years, won’t you Paint the flush of youth Don’t hesitate, for we have to master the art of dying Paint your sacrifice over everything Watch as it brings out the colour of sacrifice, my friend

BANWARILAL=>Ashafaq, stop!
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>It’s too late to back out now. Come on, move!
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>Get inside.
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>Keep the windows shut. No Indian will be hurt. We have a score to settle with the British, and we’ll leave after that.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>Come on! The keys!
GUARD=>You won’t get away with this.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>Give me the keys!
GUARD=>I swear I don’t have it.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>Banwari...get the weapon...
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>I’ll handle them. You go get the money...hurry.
BHAGAT SINGH=>I’ve committed my life to the freedom of this country. Comfort, and other worldly desires do not attract me. I know you want me to get married and settle down, like all parents do. But freedom is my bride. I hope you’ll forgive me. Your most obedient son, Bhagat Singh.
MITRO=>Breakfast?
KARAN=>General Dyer... How can one even think of doing something like this?
SONIA=>I can’t believe that he actually killed over 400 people at Jallianwala Bagh.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>389... That was the official figure. Actually nearly 1000 people were butchered.
MITRO=>Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai, I prayed for Daljeet’s well-being.
SUE=>Who’s Daljeet?
DJ=>We were champions of tolerance. So they really went for us.
SUKHI=>Even an ant bites back. But we are conditioned to take everything lying down...
MITRO=>Rubbish! It’s today’s generation which lacks the will to do anything. Have you ever heard of Shaheed Uddham Singh?
MITRO=>He went all the way to London and killed that Dyer.
MITRO=>Eat it Sonia. The butter will strengthen your bones. In Punjab every mother sends at least one son to the army. Why should we retreat? Sacrifice runs in our blood. Only idiots like DJ retreat.
DJ=>Why does it always come back to me?
MITRO=>Shut up and eat your parantha.
MITRO=>Oye Bholu, get some buttermilk.
ASLAM=>What is the most used word in this country? ADJUST! Six people sitting on a seat for four, yet a seventh one will squeeze in and say, ‘Please adjust.’
DJ=>Hey! Why are you adjusting? Come on, sit down...
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>Strange, isn’t it? We are being hunted like animals in our own country by foreigners.
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>Ashfaq you should cross the border and get to Afghanistan. We have many Muslim friends there. You will be safe with them. After all, you’re one of their own.
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>One of their own? Why? Do not you think me as one of your own?
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>Ashfaq…I didn’t mean to hurt you.
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>Ashfaq, that’s not what I meant. This is as much your country as it is mine. You have a right to fight and die for it too. Forgive me.
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>Ram, let us not talk of dying. I pray that we all live to see our grandchildren live in a free country.
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>Ram, run!
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>Run Ram, run!
BRITISH SERGEANT=>Where are your other friends? Where’s Azad?
SUKHI=>Look into my eyes...
SUE=>I loved those songs and dances.
KARAN=>That’s the reason we grow trees in this country...to dance around them.
AJAY=>Right, Mr. Hollywood.
SUKHI=>So...where are we going?
DJ=>Yes...where are we going?
ASLAM=>Hello...where?
AJAY=>Special day...special place...
SONIA=>Special day?
AJAY=>Isn’t that? Ever since I was a kid, I used to come here to watch planes take off. And watch them till they disappeared in the sky.
SUE=>What the hell are they doing?
AJAY=>Oye...hey...rowdies.
SUE=>I don’t believe them.
SONIA=>Men!
AJAY=>Come on, face it. You’d love to do that as well.
SONIA=>What? Take my shirt off and howl at planes.
AJAY=>I won’t mind if you do.
SONIA=>Dream on, buddy.
AJAY=>Boys and girls and Sukhi who is running after girls...
SUKHI=>Why me all the time?
AJAY=>I was wondering if you’d like to spend the rest of your life with me.
DJ=>Bloody idiots... AJAY’s life’s made...
BOYS=>...Life is made...life is made...
SONG: TU BIN BATAYE=>Without saying a word you steal my heart I’ll find happiness by your side I can’t stay apart
SONG: TU BIN BATAYE=>My life tastes sweet now, Since you walked through that door When your arms wrap around me, I know I’ve found my shore
SONG: TU BIN BATAYE=>When your arms wrap around me, I know I’ve found my shore Without saying a word You steal my heart I’ll find happiness by your side I can’t stay apart
SONG: TU BIN BATAYE=>Wander through the streets of my mind, like a gentle spring Walk through the corridors of my heart, fill the caravan of my dreams Whatever you sing, that is my tune Without saying a word You steal my heart I’ll find happiness by your side I can’t stay apart.
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>My prayers won’t stop till my country gets its freedom. I don’t think you can wait till then.
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>Not terrorists. Revolutionaries.
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>On this day, we walk with death and laugh at its pale spectre...
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>Death cannot take you Ashfaq, when you live in people’s hearts and minds.
QAZI=>This is the Holy Quran.
TASSADUK KHAN=>Hindus like Bismil will create a country for themselves. What will a Muslim like you get out of it? They’re just using you.
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN=>He’s not fighting for Hindu freedom, he’s fighting for Hindustan’s freedom. But you won’t be able to understand this. You've been licking the British boots for so long, you've begun to like the taste of it.
RAMPRASAD BISMIL=>It’s not your fault. You’re only doing your duty.
AJAY=>Did someone die?
AJAY=>Sue, I haven’t seen these guys so serious. What are you doing to my friends?
SUE=>It’s not me... it’s them.
AJAY=>Hey Laxman, aren’t you coming along?
LAXMAN PANDEY=>No. Some other time.
AJAY=>Come on. It’s my last night in town.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>I’m not really hungry.
KARAN=>Watch us eat then. Come on.
AJAY=>Come...
SUE=>To two lovebirds with the most insanely romantic engagement in the whole wide world...
AJAY=>I’m insane only about two things in my life—Sonia and flying.
DJ=>What is a mere heart? Take my life instead...
ASLAM=>You’re lucky to feel so passionately about something.
AJAY=>You have your poetry.
ASLAM=>Just like DJ has his singing.
AJAY=>Everyone for something, they just have to find this ‘thing’.
SUE=>Just like our revolutionaries... Their passion for freedom was greater than their love for their own lives.
KARAN=>There’s nothing in this world worth giving your life for. Do you hear me? Nothing!
DJ=>Agreed, except a beautiful woman!
SUKHI=>‘Just this once...’
DJ=>Repeat...my drink.
SONIA=>Easy DJ...
DJ=>Yes, mama.
AJAY=>There are things worth giving your life for, Karan.
KARAN=>Like what? Look at Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil and Ashfaq. They gave their lives for this country. All for nothing. It’s a shit-hole today. And who cares a shit about them now?
SONIA=>I give a shit. People like Ajay who fight for their country, give a shit. So that people like you can sleep peacefully.
DJ/SUKHI=>Take my life instead.
KARAN=>Sonia get real.
SUE=>Sonia’s right.
ASLAM=>Sue, it’s all fine for a foreigner like you to say all this. Out here, we’re fighting for the basics—food, clothing and shelter.
KARAN=>Out here you try to change things you’ll get even more screwed. Corruption is in our fucking DNA. There is no future for this country.
DJ=>She’s talking about the past, you’re thinking about the future. One foot in the past and one foot in the future, that’s why we’re pissing on the present.
SONIA=>DJ just shut up! For once in life, get serious.
AJAY=>Karan, it’s easy to be an arm-chair critic. Blaming others is even easier. If there are problems, why don’t you go out there and change things? Take a stand. Join politics, the police force, government and clean it up. But you won’t! I’ll tell you why. Because you don't want to dirty your hands sticking it into the shit-hole.
KARAN=>Nothing’s going to change. You can go to your grave trying, it won’t make any difference.
DJ=>Correct...the only difference will be how you go to your grave.
SUE=>No.
SONIA=>DJ, relax.
DJ=>I’m not drunk. Am I drunk Sue?
DJ=>See, the director’s word is final. Cut it!... Where were we?
SUKHI=>On the way to our graves.
DJ=>All our ‘THE END’s’ will be the same, wrapped in white shrouds. Only Ajay will be wrapped in the national flag.
DJ=>Karan, you can say whatever you want, not even the street dogs will bark when we die. But Ajay will get a 21 gun salute.
AJAY=>Karan, this is for you.
SUKHI=>The girls fall for Karan anyway. If anyone deserves the jacket, it’s me.
DJ=>Wow! What a dutiful daughter-in- law. Now show what a dutiful wife you will be too.
AJAY=>DJ’s right. Touch my feet, madam.
SONIA=>See what women in this country have to put up with?
SUE=>I think DJ’s right. You should respect your traditions.
AJAY=>See, even Sue agrees, a woman’s place is at her husband’s feet.
DJ=>Wow, Gulabo...
SONIA=>Really?
AJAY’S MOTHER=>These two can be such children. They spend half their time fighting, the other half making up.
SONIA=>Sweetie-pie, can’t you stay a while longer?
AJAY=>No, I have to go...
SUKHI=>SWEETIE-PIE!
BOYS=>O beloved, don’t leave my arms. I promise, I will break down and cry...
SUE=>I know how Sonia must be feeling right now. My father was also in the army.
AJAY’S MOTHER=>I used to think that way too, when Ajay’s father and I got married. But then you realise something about being an Air Force pilot’s wife. You realise that your husband has pledged his life for the country. The least you can do for him, is control your emotions. Not be weak.
AJAY’S MOTHER=>I’m so happy Ajay’s chosen a girl like you. Now I can die in peace.
SONIA=>Don’t talk this way, Ma.
AJAY=>You’ll have to tell stories of valour to a dozen grandchildren too.
ASLAM=>Grandchildren? First you’ve got to stay home long enough to make them, dude.
AZAD=>The bugle sounds, the enemy wakes. The battle is upon us, and in our hearts We feel the swell, of pride and steel and valour. For we will play the game of blood, if dark clouds shroud our land. Because this day, we walk with death, and laugh at its pale spectre.
AZAD=>We will not fear those cruel swords, our courage is far sharper. The hands of men filled with passion can never be slashed with swords. We will not lower, in the face of threats, a hand raised to its mother. For let them know, their cowardly deeds, just serve to fuel our fires. Because this day, we walk with death, and laugh at its pale spectre.
LALA LAJPAT RAI=>Simon! Go back!
CROWD=>Go home, Simon!
AZAD=>We bade knowing it could be our last. We swore to play, with our lives, never waver in our task. For we have accepted the invitation, Of fate’s celebration of death.
BHAGAT SINGH=>Long live the revolution!
CHORUS=>In our hearts we have a horde of storms, and the spirit of revolution in our veins. We will unleash this and more, and upon them we will rain. The destination dare not defy us, when passion is our beacon. Because this day, we walk with death, and laugh at its pale spectre.
RADIO ANNOUNCER=>The entire country is in a state of mourning over Lala Lajpat Rai’s death. Just before his death, Lalaji had said this...
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>We have to take drastic measures.
SUKHDEV=>What drastic measures?
DURGA BHABHI=>Kill him!
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>Come on.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>Bhagat run! Quick! You! Get going! We don’t want to kill any Indian.
SUE=>Inquilab Zindabad—two words that became the slogan for India’s freedom struggle.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>Great idea! But Bhagat, escaping will be impossible.
BHAGAT SINGH=>Our mission is to get caught, not escape.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>What?
BHAGAT SINGH=>If we get caught, there will be a trial, we’ll get a chance to speak. We’ll be heard by all Indians.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>But if they catch us, they’ll hang us for certain.
BHAGAT SINGH=>I know. But it takes a loud noise to open deaf ears.
BHAGAT SINGH=>Long live the revolution!
BATUKESHWAR DUTT=>Long live the revolution!
BHAGAT SINGH=>Long live the revolution!
SONG: KHALBALI=>There is an unrest sweeping through the land The embers are swaying The tide, it’s turning You can feel the winds of change You can feel the unrest Feel the land.
BHAGAT SINGH=>We are political prisoners. We should be allowed books, writing material and at least one daily newspaper.
RAJGURU=>We will not eat till then. The hunger strike will continue.
SONG: KHALBALI=>Our words won’t falter now, we will speak our mind We won’t back down now. Our dreams, we won’t leave behind We won’t let the storm die Injustice we will defy.
SONG: KHALBALI=>Feel the unrest You can feel it possess you now Feel your soul claim it Drink this spirit in one long swallow and let it course through your veins Let the celebrations begin now, feel your body sway In every breath feel more alive to keep the storm at bay See the unrest in those eyes, See it all around, See it in the air, my friend In those hearts, abound.
SONG: KHALBALI=>The winds of change are blowing now The tide it is, a turning The moment of truth is upon us now.
SONG: KHALBALI=>It’s time to do or die. We are engulfed in the shadows But we will come out brighter.
SUKHI=>Oops...
SONG: LUKA CHUPPI=>This game of hide-and-seek has gone on too long, son. Come home now, won’t you. I’ve searched high and low, These old eyes are weary so, Come home now, won’t you. Dusk is spreading like the ache in my heart...
SONG: LUKA CHUPPI=>I’m in a place you wouldn’t believe Ma. Endless skies I can soar. Just like your fairy tales, it’s filled with dreams. A sea of hope with no shore. My soul flies here, like a kite without fear No one to cut my strings, no more.
SONG: LUKA CHUPPI=>Dusk is spreading like the ache in my heart and fear now blurs my vision. Come home now, son, won’t you...
CORRESPONDENT=>Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod stayed in the plane until the very end and steered it clear of Ambala city, thereby saving many lives, while laying down his own.
PANKAJ PACHAURI=>In the last 10 years, over 100 MiG- 21s of the IAF have crashed, in which over 30 pilots have lost their lives. Defence Minister Shastri, the CAG report states that old and defective Russian spare parts were procured by the government. Isn’t this a case of high-level corruption?
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI=>Not at all. I’ve personally clarified the issue in parliament. It’s is a downright lie. The youngsters of today are brash and irresponsible when it comes to flying planes.
RETIRED OFFICER=>No! I don’t agree. Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod was an ace pilot whom I trained. He was a gold medalist, the youngest to clear night sorties with over 1000 flying hours. This can’t be the record of an irresponsible pilot.
SPECTATOR IN THE SHOW=>Mr. Minister, how many more pilots will you send to their graves, before you stem the rot in the system?
VOICES=>Right!
ANOTHER MAN=>Will our soldiers keep dying in vain?
SONG: LUKA CHUPPI=>If only I could show you this place, Ma Here waterfalls are made of rainbows
SONG: LUKA CHUPPI=>There are no roses, just bouquets of dreams Ma Their scent no flower can hope for Here sunlight and shadow walk hand in hand Everything seems bright and new But what is heaven, and all of its wonders, when Ma, I don’t have you...
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI=>From now on, the government will make sure that only experienced pilots are given access to these machines and not to rash pilots like Ajay Rathod. I welcome any investigation. I have nothing to hide.
ASLAM=>What the hell is he talking about?
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI=>This damn MiG shouldn’t take us down.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Relax Sir. Public memory is short. Besides, we’ll handle things.
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI=>Dead pilots live long lives in the media.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>But then they join the forces to sacrifice their lives, don’t they?
CORRESPONDENT=>The situation is tense at the moment. There is growing anger and discontent directed largely towards the government, especially the Defence Minister.
CORRESPONDENT=>Ajay Rathore’s mother is with us.
AJAY’S MOTHER=>The government can’t wash its hand off the issue like this. They are answerable to the public. If the MiG spare parts were of doubtful quality, why were they bought in the first place? For what? Money? Money won’t bring our children back.
ASLAM=>The Defence Minister is morally responsible. He has to resign.
NDTV CORRESPONDENT=>It looks like the veil has been pulled off the defence scam. But how much will be revealed, only time will tell. C. Bhargav from India Gate, for NDTV.
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI=>Mishra, what’s happening?
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Ajay Rathod was not a novice. He didn’t let his plane crash into the town. When it developed a snag he didn’t try to save his life. He steered it clear of Ambala, saving thousands of civilians. Yet the Defence Minister calls him irresponsible. Right that’s enough now. We would like to know how many ministers in this country have sons are in the forces.
SPECIAL POLICE FORCE INSPECTOR=>Move on. We don’t want any trouble here. Time to go home.
AJAY’S MOTHER=>I’m not moving. This is for Ajay.
ASLAM=>This could turn ugly, Aunty.
SONIA=>Let it.
SONG: KHOON CHALA=>Our blood is boiling It’s flowing through the streets. To seep into the mirror of our eyes. Dripping from our bodies, Caressing the earth. Meandering through the streets and alleys Surging and sweeping. To paint a new world.
SONG: KHOON CHALA=>From gaping wounds, and gashes large, it oozed, slowly and steadily. If the finger is but to point, the calling of the fist is to respond. Blood knows this and surges... Our blood is boiling, It’s flowing through the streets.
DOCTOR=>Take her to the emergency room! Quick!
DOCTOR=>Could you please wait here...we need to check the patient...
LAXMAN PANDEY=>They were beating up innocent people. Why didn’t you stop them?
MISHRA=>You the government, our own party. That’s unacceptable.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>The protest was not against the government, it was for the truth. So many pilots have died...young innocent boys who were fighting for our country, killed so that someone in the government could make money. And our party office doesn’t do a thing about it.
MISHRA=>Sit down... Have some tea.
MISHRA=>Don’t be so emotional. In politics there’s no place for emotions. The party has big plans for you...
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Big plans! I don’t care either for your party or you since you have sold your soul.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>How’s Aunty?
KARAN=>They’re doing an MRI.
DOCTOR=>She’s slipped into a coma. Severe skull damage, coupled with the shock of her son’s death.
DOCTOR=>That’s an ugly gash. Nurse, she needs stitches. In case you need anything, I am there.
SONIA=>Aslam... How’s he?
AMANULLAH KHAN=>What have you come for? Haven’t you done enough damage?
DJ=>Uncle, it isn’t what you think...
AMANULLAH KHAN=>I’m not interested in what you think, in what you want to do. I’m just going to say this once. Aslam doesn’t know what’s good for him. He’s an emotional boy, always has been. He listens to his heart, not his head. These are bad times for people like us. Don’t take him down with you.
AMANULLAH KHAN=>He’s inside. Go on...
ASLAM=>Guddu, go outside.
DJ=>All parts working?
ASLAM=>Don’t make me laugh, idiot. It hurts. How’s Aunty?
KARAN=>She’s in a coma.
SUKHI=>How can this be happening to us?
ASLAM’S MOTHER=>Dinner?
KARAN=>No, don’t worry Aunty. We just came to see Aslam. We’ve got to get back to the hospital. Take care...
LAXMAN PANDEY=>I... I’m sorry.
SUE=>Eat something...
DJ=>Everything’s falling apart and all I can do is stand and watch. People like us don’t count out here. Thousands like Ajay can die. It will make no difference. Nothing will change.
DJ=>This system is so messed up, a hundred more Ajay’s can die and nothing will change... Ajay did everything right all his life. He was a good pilot, a good friend, a good son. He never harmed a soul...he didn’t deserve this. Sonia didn’t deserve this.
SUE=>As I watched DJ sleep that night, a strange thought occurred to me. Maybe DJ wasn’t sleeping, maybe none of them were. Maybe they were all waking up.
AJAY=>Hey Karan, they’ve spoilt your jacket.
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI=>Long live India!
ASLAM=>The scoundrel got away with it again.
SUKHI=>There’s nothing can we do when the law of the land protects people like the Defence Minister.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>We have to take drastic measures.
SUKHI=>What do you mean? Do what?
SONIA=>Kill him!
SUKHI=>What? Kill the Defence Minister! Are you crazy?
ASLAM=>We aren’t killers, Sonia.
KARAN=>But they are.
SUKHI=>Have you lost it, Karan?
BHAGAT SINGH=>It’s not blood lust. It’s a matter of justice.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>I’ll get the gun.
SUKHI=>Don’t fuel things, Pandey. We can’t start killing people for just about any reason...
KARAN=>You think Ajay’s death is a small reason? What happened with Ajay’s mother is a small reason?
ASLAM=>Be reasonable Karan.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD=>Lala Lajpat Rai’s death has to be avenged. Scott has to be killed.
ASLAM=>But... I always thought we didn’t believe in anything.
KARAN=>So did I. Until now.
SUKHI=>Have we all gone crazy?
LAXMAN PANDEY=>He takes a morning walk at 8 a.m. everyday. We can kill him then.
SUKHI=>Who’s ‘we’?... Who’s going to pull the trigger?
DJ=>I will.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Even though the morning security is relaxed, there is still the danger of getting caught.
KARAN=>There is no looking back now!
PARTY SPOKESPERSON=>The country has lost a great leader because of the cowardly act of some terrorists. He was a true soldier, a true patriot. His contribution to the country cannot be described in words.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Sukhi...
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>The Russians want us to reduce our commission.
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI=>Didn’t you tell them, it’s not a defense deal, but our deal?
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>That’s why I told them, ‘Take it or leave it.’
DJ=>Let’s go.
SUE=>Paaji, where’s DJ?
PAAJI=>They just left.
AMANULLAH KHAN=>He hasn’t come home all night.
AMANULLAH KHAN=>Is everything alright.
SUE=>Yes...
ASLAM’S MOTHER=>He said he’d be spending the night at DJ’s...
SUE=>Have you seen DJ?
MITRO=>Is everything alright?
MITRO=>Come here. Sit!
MITRO=>Don’t worry. Nothing will happen to those boys.
SUE=>But DJ...
MITRO=>Daljeet has always been a brat, he used to disappear on his bike for days... He’s my only child. If I had more, I wouldn’t worry so much.
SUE=>I’m scared.
MITRO=>Don’t be afraid. God watches over the people we love.
SUKHI=>Defence Minister...the martyr, one of India’s precious sons...scoundrel...
ASLAM=>Next they will honour him with the Bharat Ratna.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>What a waste.
DJ=>People need to know the truth...
ASLAM=>And who is going to tell it to them.
DJ=>We will...by surrendering ourselves.
ASLAM=>What?... Terrific!... You want us to walk right in, give ourselves up and expect them to understand! Why?
SONIA=>And who should we surrender to? The police are mere puppets.
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Then what should we do? Just sit back? Let them make him a hero?
SUKHI=>No! Let’s kill them all! Right Pandey? Tish...Tish...Tish...
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Someone make him shut up...
SUKHI=>You knew your father was involved. You knew all along.
KARAN=>No, Sukhi...
SUKHI=>You’re lying!... You always wanted to take revenge on your father...
DJ=>Sukhi, shut up!
SUKHI=>Who am I to say anything?
SUKHI=>DJ, he’s used you...
DJ=>That’s enough, Sukhi.
SUKHI=>He’s used all of us.
SUKHI=>Mark my words, his father will bail him out. But we’ll get caught. And I don’t want to die DJ, I don’t want to die...
SONIA=>We did all this for Ajay...
SUKHI=>What will happen now, DJ?
DJ=>Have you thought it over?
KARAN=>I need to know the truth. Don’t worry.
DJ=>I’m not worried. Just don’t be late.
RAHUL=>The night is still young. The name of the show is ‘Raat Baki Baat Baki’, I’m Rahul and let’s rock the party tonight... Great DJ remixes coming up for you people...
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Nothing will happen to you Karan. That’s a promise. Just give me the names of the others. I’ll get you the best lawyers, pull all the strings possible. You were forced into it, do you understand? You were forced by your friends. Then you are out of this country.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Do you get me?
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Say something, God damn it. Your father’s reputation, his life’s work are at stake.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Why did you do it?
KARAN=>Why did you do it, Dad?
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>What did I do?
KARAN=>Ajay always said, ‘I’ll give my life for this country’, ‘I’m not afraid of death.’ Ajay was burnt alive... and all you can think of is sending me out of the country. You killed him! You made a joke of his death...
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>I know you’re very disturbed. Relax! Let me handle things.
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>I’ll find a way out.
KARAN=>Really Dad? Is there a way out?
RAJNATH SINGHANIA=>Of course.
DJ=>You don’t have to do this.
SUKHI=>No man...
DJ=>Sukhi, this might end badly.
SUKHI=>Without you guys, it will be the end for me anyway.
DJ=>Idiot. C’mon.
SONIA=>Ajay’s death won’t be in vain, Ma. I promise you.
SUE=>I prayed for them...I prayed for their well-being...
RAHUL=>This is Rahul, and you’ve tuned in to your favourite radio show. We have some great music lined up tonight, so let’s begin with R.D. Burman...
RAHUL=>Hey Karan! What’re you doing here?
KARAN=>We need a favour.
RAHUL=>Sure.
DJ=>I need you to put us on air.
RAHUL=>Put you on air?
KARAN=>Yes, right now! Live!
RAHUL=>That’s impossible man. I’ll lose my job. As it is, they don’t pay me.
DJ=>It’s payback time.
RAHUL=>Hey! Whatever you say DJ! It’s your station.
LADY=>Gun... He’s got a gun!
DJ=>Karan you go in. I’ll handle it. Keep the show going. Don’t mess with us.
DJ=>Come on...leave. No need to panic. Everything’s alright. Paaji, is anyone inside?
DJ=>Uncleji, run... Don’t stop...
SUKHI=>Everybody, out! Move!
LAXMAN PANDEY=>Don’t be a wise, guys. Don’t panic. We won’t harm anyone. Just vacate the building.
ASLAM=>Come on, move...move.
DJ=>Hurry up, quick!
RAHUL=>The time is 6:05 a.m. And you’re listening to ‘The night is still young’. Today I have a surprise guest for you—an old friend of mine, Karan Singhania who just dropped in to say something to all of you...
KARAN=>My name is Karan Singhania.My friends and I, we killed the Defence Minister.
KARAN=>I repeat we killed the Defence Minister.
SUE=>Ravi, take me to the radio station quickly. Hurry up!
KARAN=>We are not terrorists. We aren’t backed by any foreign organisation. We don’t even belong to any political group. We’re just five students from Delhi University. We killed the Defence Minister because he murdered our friend Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod and many other Air Force pilots...
KARAN=>We killed him because after he murdered Ajay, he sullied his reputation. Ajay’s mother...who not only saw her son, but also her husband lay down his life for his country, is right now in a coma... fighting for her life.
KARAN=>A Defence Minister is supposed to safeguard a nation. Not sell it. Men like the Defence Minister aren’t just above the law. They control it. We killed him because someone had to say, ‘Enough!’. It’s a sin to kill someone, but we couldn’t tolerate it anymore. Today we are here to confess our sin. Today we are here to tell everybody that something has to be done by all of us.
RAHUL=>Karan Singhania and his friends are still with us. Listeners can call in on 3291777, if you wish to speak to them. Till then, here is...
KARAN=>It’s done.
SONG: RU BA RU=>Hey, dude! I just realised There’ s a fire burning within me It’s a new dawn, I can feel its light So bright, it could consume the sun Cause I’m face-to-face with the light The dream I once lost, I’ve found it, it’s blooming, It’s melting, Notes arranging into a whole new melody Cause I’m face-to-face with the light
SUKHI=>Will they give us good food in jail?
DJ=>Food? Next he’ll want beer. Idiot...
SONG: RU BA RU=>The mist has cleared, I can see the sky A new road, a new journey lies before me If only you could stand by my side, Like a duet sharing a symphony.
RAHUL=>You guys have become famous. Calls are pouring in from all over the country...
RAHUL=>Come on! They want to talk to you. The fire you lit is spreading.

SONG: RU BA RU=>Hey, dude! I just realised There’s a fire burning within me It’s a new dawn, I can feel its light So bright it could consume the sun Cause I’m face to face with the light This fire is ready to face any storm The flames burn brighter and stronger Whether I leave my mark, Whether I stay the path Today I’ve tasted the light Like a torch, I’m burning bright Why must be keep bearing Cause I’m face to face with the light
