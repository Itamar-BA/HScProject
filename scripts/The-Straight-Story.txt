DOROTHY=>Hey Rose.
ROSE=>Hey Dorothy.
BUD=>I'm goin' over there.
SIG=>We're waitin'.
BUD=>Alvin! Alvin Straight!
DOROTHY=>Rose left a couple of hours ago.
BUD=>Did you hear me hollerin' for Rose? I'm not lookin' for Rose.
DOROTHY=>I ain't seen Alvin today.
BUD=>Did I ask....
BUD=>Straight. ......you're late!!
BUD=>What the hell Alvin!
ALVIN=>Come on in Bud.
BUD=>Where the hell are you Alvin? I can't see a damn thing.
ALVIN=>I'm right here Bud...watch your step.
BUD=>What the hell's goin' on? What in god- damn hell are you doin' on the floor Alvin? What'r ye nuts? You're supposed to be down at Davmar's one hour ago.
DOROTHY=>What's going on....
ALVIN=>Hey there Dorothy.
BUD=>What the hell are you doin'?
DOROTHY=>What's the number for 911?
ALVIN=>Dorothy, put that phone down.
BUD=>I gotta call the bar and tell them we're not comin'.
DOROTHY=>Bud Heimstra are you crazy? We have a stricken man here.
BUD=>You stricken Alvin?
ALVIN=>Dorothy, PUT THAT PHONE DOWN!
ROSE=>Dad? What's all the.......yelling?
BUD=>Oh for cry aye.
ROSE=>Dad?..........are you........?
ALVIN=>I just need some help gettin' up.
ALVIN=>I'm not goin'.
ROSE=>Dad.....
ALVIN=>I'm not goin'.
ROSE=>Dad....you promised me.
ALVIN=>Alright Rosie.
NURSE=>O.K. Mr. Straight, you need to take off all your clothes except your underwear and put this robe on.
ALVIN=>Just bring me the doctor.
ROSE=>I see you like birds. I build.......bird- houses........for bluebirds.
NURSE=>Oh, that's nice.
ROSE=>Yah.....Pete sells my birdhouses........at the.....Ace.
NURSE=>Oh...I'll look for them next time I'm in.
DOCTOR GIBBONS=>So you're not sure just how long you were on the floor?
ALVIN=>I remember my cane slippin'...and losing my balance.... ...next thing I knew Bud Heimstra was banging on my kitchen door.
DOCTOR GIBBONS=>Listen Alvin, sometimes it's my job to tell people things they don't want to hear. I'm concerned about you. I think you need an operation on those hips.
ALVIN=>No operations.
DOCTOR=>Well...this morning you fall and can't get off the floor...that's your hips Alvin. You'll have to use a walker to get around now.
ALVIN=>No walker.
DOCTOR=>Fine...a second cane then. You say you're not seeing too well. That could be a diabetes-related problem. I would like to run some...
ALVIN=>No!
DOCTOR GIBBONS=>I can see and hear that you smoke. I would guess you're in the early stages of emphysema. And Alvin you have circulation problems. I worry about your diet and unless you change some things quick, there will be some serious consequences.
ROSE=>It has a.........red roof.
ALVIN=>That's another pretty one Rose.
ROSE=>I want to paint the.......next roof... ...blue.
ALVIN=>That's a good idea.
ROSE=>What did the.......Doctor say?
ALVIN=>Said I'm goin' to live to be a hundred.
ROSE=>I can......cut it for......you...Dad.
ALVIN=>I got it sweetheart.
ALVIN=>Damn!
APPLE=>Looks like another low comin' out of the panhandle of Texas. That's where they all come from. You know in the winter that's where we get all our big dumps.
PETE=>Apple I doubt very much if we'll be getting snow this week.
SIG=>And here comes Alvin Straight. He's not movin' too well.
PETE=>Well he took that bad fall.
BUD=>An hour late! I found the darn fool on the kitchen floor.
SIG=>He looks like he ain't gonna make it to the door. If he was a horse they'd shoot 'im.
PETE=>How old are you now Sig?
APPLE=>He's 70 in September..."Oh the days dwindle down to a precious few..."
SIG=>You can shut up any time Apple.
PETE=>Mornin' Alvin. What can I do for you?
APPLE=>Local forecast!
PETE=>And what can I do you for Alvin?
ALVIN=>Plugs for the Rehds. Won't start.
ALVIN=>Storm comin'...not mowin' today.
WEATHER PERSON=>Severe thunderstorm warning and tornado watch continue until 9 PM for all of west central Iowa. The National Weather Service advises seeking shelter in basement rooms. Avoid all windows...
ALVIN=>I love a lightning storm.
ROSE=>Me....too Dad.
ROSE=>Hello.........this.......is Rose. Yah...yah...Uncle......Lyle?
WEATHER PERSON=>A tornado has been sited in Ida County. Sac, Calhoun and Pocahontas Counties are all under tornado watch...
ROSE=>No Bobby he....didn't say much......They both been so......stubborn. No......no it was longer. I remember...It was July 7, 1988. Bobby, I always remember.....the dates.
ALVIN=>Rose honey, why don't you come in here and join your dad for a cup of coffee.
ROSE=>Dad..........we're not going to move again are we? You always set me down for a coffee when you tell me we are going to move again.
ALVIN=>No honey...we're not breaking camp.
ROSE=>Dad..oh jeez..I can stop making them...
ALVIN=>Easy honey. Your pa was just makin' a joke.
ROSE=>But Dad....how are you.......?
ALVIN=>I haven't quite figured that out yet.
ROSE=>One...Your eyes are bad....That is why you don't drive your car because you cannot see the signs anymore.
ROSE=>Three....Your hips. You can't hardly stand for two minutes and when you do stand up after you are sitting down this is the sound you make when you stand... "aaaaaraaaaarrrrhhgggg. " That is your arthritis sound.
ALVIN=>Rosie....darlin'....I'm not dead yet.
ROSE=>What are we building?
ROSE=>Coffee.
BRENDA=>Havin' a party.
ROSE=>Oh......Jeez I love parties.
BRENDA=>Yah, me too.
ROSE=>So where's it at?
BRENDA=>Where's what at?
ROSE=>Your party.
BRENDA=>I'm not havin' a party. I thought you're havin' a party.
ROSE=>I am?
BRENDA=>Well yah...look at all that braunsweiger.
ROSE=>Yah it's a lot of braunschweiger.
ROSE=>It's for my dad.....for his.....trip. My dad.......He...is going to.......Wisconsin.
BRENDA=>Oh Wisconsin! A real party state.
ROSE=>I hate braunschweiger.
PETE=>Morning Alvin. How are you today Rose?
ROSE=>My.....dad....is going to see.....his .....brother. I keep askin' him how....he's goin' to get there.....but he doesn't say.....nothin'.
PETE=>Your bluebird houses are selling well Rose. I'm gonna need some more from you.
SIG=>Taking a trip Alvin eh?
ALVIN=>Yup.
APPLE=>Well if you're traveling by car you know my wife'll get those AAA trip tix. Those babies'll tell you where every piece of construction is all along the "I" system.
PETE=>I don't suspect Alvin'll be takin' your wife along with him Apple.
ALVIN=>Oh Lord.
BUD=>You can take my wife.
SIG=>Where's your brother at Alvin?
ROSE=>Mt. Zion. Sixty-three miles east of the Missi.....ssippi.
PETE=>Sixty-three miles, eh Rose?
APPLE=>Did you know that the Mississippi..the old mighty Mississipp..is the single most profitable waterway in the world? Did you know that the Japanese harvest pearls outta the river down to Prairie du Chien....pearls!
SIG=>And carp.
PETE=>And walleye...need help there Alvin?
ALVIN=>No thanks, Pete.
SIG=>What's doin' at your brother's Alvin? The Straight family reunion?
ALVIN=>You could say that.
SIG=>Alvin you got three 5-gallon cans. Fifteen gallons of gas there. Just what you gonna do with that much gas?
ROSE=>Local forecast!
SIG=>Ahh....so what you need so much gas for Alvin?
ALVIN=>Sig, you are one nosy sonofagun.
BUD=>You got that right.
ALVIN=>Pete, I'd like to buy that from you.
PETE=>Jeez Alvin.
ALVIN=>Well?
PETE=>I do have two of them...I guess I could sell you that one.
ALVIN=>Five bucks would seem about right.
PETE=>Those things are hard to come by Alvin. It would take me two months to get another one on order. That's a damn good grabber. Jeez...I can't let that grabber go for less than.....jeez.....$10.00.
ALVIN=>OK. Ring her up.
PETE=>Three 5-gallon gas cans at $9.89. Two Styrofoam coolers...
PETE=>Two coolers, 99 cents and one....one...Alvin...
ALVIN=>Ring it up Pete.
PETE=>With tax that's $44.25.
SIG=>What you need that grabber for Alvin?
ALVIN=>Grabbin'.
APPLE=>Hah! It's a nail!
ROSE=>Oh.....jeeez Dad. Oh jeez......Dad.
ALVIN=>Now Rose you gotta cease with your worryin'. You get that from your mother.
ROSE=>But Dad....you....can't.
ALVIN=>Rose...."can't" doesn't live here.
ALVIN=>It's gonna be fine Rose.
ROSE=>Dad....please. I will find someone to drive you to Wisconsin. Pete........you like Pete.....Pete...he is a good driver.
ALVIN=>Now, Rose, sweetheart......
ROSE=>One, Wisconsin...Two, Minnesota... Three, Wyoming but not long...Four was Oregon. We had goats. Five.....New Mexico and......six.....good old....Iowa.
ALVIN=>Remember when we traveled...you and your sister and brothers...
ROSE=>Yeah. But this is different Dad.
ALVIN=>It is Rose...it's easier..I'm not luggin' seven kids in the back.
ROSE=>But Dad.....you will be all alone. Won't you be lonely?
ALVIN=>Rosie...sometimes a man likes bein' a little lonely.
ROSE=>I will be alone......here...
ALVIN=>And you're going to be just fine. Dorothy is next door and she can't keep her nose out of our business. She'll be over here seven times a day.
ROSE=>Wait 'til she hears about.........this Dad.
ALVIN=>Rose I got to go see Lyle. I got to make this trip on my own. I know you understand that.
ROSE=>I guess so....
ALVIN=>Look at that sky Rose...full of stars tonight.
BRENDA=>One bag of potato chips, two boxes of powdered donuts, one bag of corn nuts, six pack of Coca-Cola, two Snickers, three Hostess Sno-Balls...
DOROTHY=>Give me a couple packs of Salem lights will ya hon?
DOROTHY=>Well....I don't believe my eyes.
BRENDA=>Oh yah. He's goin' to visit his brother in Wisconsin.
DOROTHY=>On a lawnmower?!?!
BRENDA=>Yah...
DOROTHY=>Great party place, Wisconsin.
SIG=>Crimenetto.
APPLE=>Alvin just what are you settin' out to do here?
BUD=>Oh for da cry eye Alvin.
APPLE=>Alvin you are gonna get blown right off the road is what I'm afraid.
SIG=>Oh.... ... jeez Alvin.
PETE=>He'll never make it past the Grotto.
ALVIN=>Go on home now.
ALVIN=>I'm having some engine trouble.
BUSDRIVER=>What the heck are you driving there.
ALVIN=>A Rehds.
BUSDRIVER=>I can get you as far as the Grotto. This is the SUN-RAY Tour.
ALVIN=>I'd appreciate that.
TOUR GUIDE=>...The Pastor of this Catholic Parish began his work on the Grotto in 1912 and continued it until his death in 1954. All this work you see before you was done by hand...
WENDELL=>May I share the bench? As you can see I have a little arthritis myself.
ALVIN=>Be my guest.
WENDELL=>This was one fellow who had quite a bit of time on his hands.
ALVIN=>A lot of work.
WENDELL=>Well I'll tell you. My wife passed away in '87. After she was gone I spent a lot of time alone. Oh there were women who came out of the woodwork trying to cook and clean for me. I managed to keep myself unattached and they finally stopped coming around. Then things got pretty quiet. I got to missing things.
ALVIN=>My wife passed in 1981.
WENDELL=>My daughter tricked me into one of these bus trips a couple of years ago. It was The House on the Rock if I'm not mistaken. A very interesting structure that. I was the only man on that bus. It was a singular experience.
ALVIN=>I bet.
WENDELL=>I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed all that femininity. I discovered how much I missed it. Since then I make one of these bus trips every other month. I rather enjoy the attention.
ALVIN=>I live with my daughter Rose. Of course, it's different from being with my wife, but it's a comfort to have a woman around.
WENDELL=>There's not a man born who doesn't enjoy being fussed over.
ALVIN=>You wouldn't a had your way with any of these fillies now wouldja?
WENDELL=>It is a wonder how invigorating a tumble with a maiden can be.
ALVIN=>If there's a maiden on that bus I'll dance a jig.
WENDELL=>See those three over there? They're Dominican nuns.
ALVIN=>You mean my trailer.
WENDELL=>Is that what that is? Why would you attach a trailer to a lawnmower?
ALVIN=>I'm takin' a trip. That's where I bunk.
WENDELL=>A trip on a lawnmower? That's an interesting means of conveyance. A bit hard on the hips isn't it?
ALVIN=>No worse than a tumble with a maiden.
ALVIN=>It's not too bad. A little rough on the dismount.
WENDELL=>And what's your destination?
ALVIN=>Mt. Zion.
WENDELL=>Wisconsin?
ALVIN=>Yup.
WENDELL=>I admire your gumption.
FIRST WOMAN=>Oh Wendell. The tour guide has so much to say. We hate to see you miss this.
ALVIN=>Thank you.
WENDELL=>Bon voyage my friend.
ALVIN=>Adios.
SIG=>Told ya that mower wouldn't make it mor'n a few miles. Alvin , he's got more brass than brains.
PETE=>Hardly out a full day.
APPLE=>Least he's not hurt. Old timer like that on the road. There's no tellin'.
WEATHER PERSON=>...and now for your local forecast.
ROSE=>...so the man in a pick up...he brought my...my dad back.
DOROTHY=>Oh...I must've been at the beauty parlor. What kinda pickup?
ROSE=>A Ford.
DOROTHY=>What's your dad doin' with that gun?
ROSE=>I.....don't know. My dad...he got medals in the war for sharpshootin'.... But his eyes ain't so good now.
DOROTHY=>Jeez.
ROSE=>What.....are those Dad?
ALVIN=>My Mexican coins.
ROSE=>Remember...I was born in New Mexico....June....20...1960. The Mexican coin is a........peso........Why are you gluing pesos on your hat?
ALVIN=>Ballast.
ROSE=>Ballast.
ANDY=>That's the LD 155 right Mr. Hillenbrandt.
TOM=>As I told ya'...Andy I'd rather ya didn't call me "Mister Hillenbrandt." Tom is fine. People hear you call me Mister and they'll think I've actually become a real businessman. Pretty soon they'll all be calling me Mr. Hillenbrandt and I'd have to sell my implement business and move to someplace where folks call me "Tom" again.
ANDY=>Sorry...T...T...Tom...it's just that I've been calling you Mister Hillenbrandt all my life...
TOM=>Well you're out of school and a workin' fool like the rest of us now Andy and you can start usin' first names. And one other thing...that's not the LD 155, that's the LT 155.
ANDY=>Would you like to me to handle this one...Tom?
TOM=>Sure. It's Alvin Straight. I'm sure you'll do just fine Andy.
ANDY=>Good morning. I'm Andy Laufenberg. Anything I can help you with today sir.
ALVIN=>Well Andy Laufenberg...I'm looking to get a riding mower. I want good power -- comfortable ride.
ANDY=>Well sir this is the one to look at. It's the John Deere LT 155....
ALVIN=>Japanese?
ANDY=>No ah sir...no I'm not. I'm mostly Dutch.
ALVIN=>The engine. Kawasaki. A Japanese engine?
ANDY=>Yessir.
ALVIN=>LT.
ANDY=>Beg your pardon?
ALVIN=>LT...LT 155...says here right on the side.
ANDY=>And you're right sir...similar models. By Gish that is the LT 155. Same engine looks like and...it's...got....air cooling...electronic ignition...right here with that key....It's got a hydrostatic drive transmission.
ALVIN=>And what would that be?
ANDY=>Good question and I'm sure I can get that answer for you...
ALICE=>How's he doin'?
TOM=>Young salesmen are a painful thing to witness. You add Alvin to the mix and we may have to call the paramedics.
ALICE=>Shouldn't you rescue him now?
ANDY=>It's also got disc breaks...Mr...ah...Mr... ah...sir.
ALVIN=>Straight. Mr. Alvin Straight.
ANDY=>Well Alvin. Disc brakes on a lawn mower. Isn't that something?
ALVIN=>You're young enough to be my grand- son. Proper thing would be to call me Mr. Straight. If a buck private called me Alvin I made him shovel slop.
ANDY=>Right Mr. Straight. I'm a bit new at this and....and...well--
ANDY=>Just talking to Mr. Straight here, Mr. Hillenbrandt... ah...well...he's interested here in a LT 155.
TOM=>Mornin' Alvin.
ALVIN=>Tom.
TOM=>Alvin the LT 155 runs about $2500 dollars. What ya lookin' to spend today?
ALVIN=>Not that much.
TOM=>Follow me Alvin. Andy, Alice has some paperwork you need to fill out.
ANDY=>OK Mr. Hillenbrandt.
TOM=>You did fine Andy. Didn't he Alvin?
ALVIN=>Pleasure doing business with you Mr. Laufenberg.
TOM=>Can you follow me around back Alvin? I got something that might fit your needs.
TOM=>I set you up with that old Rehds that we had the last time didn't I, Alvin?
ALVIN=>That you did.
TOM=>That ran about $325. Same price range?
ALVIN=>Generally.
TOM=>You tradin' in the Rehds today?
ALVIN=>I don't think so Tom.
TOM=>Pete tells me that you tried usin' the rider in an interesting way. Still planning to do that?
ALVIN=>Still planning to Tom.
TOM=>I know better than to talk Alvin Straight out of anything he sets his mind to. But I have to tell you Alvin that you have always struck me as a smart man....
ALVIN=>That's appreciated.
TOM=>...Until now.
ALVIN=>What year?
TOM=>'66. Has the Kohler engine. We've used it for parts but I always order and replace them when they arrive. The guts are good.
ALVIN=>How fast will it go?
TOM=>'Bout five miles an hour...more down- hill. It's got the old transmission. Nothing fancy.
ALVIN=>What are you askin' Tom?
TOM=>Alvin, we've done business before. I know you're an old horse trader from way back and I don't much feel like sparring with you today. Hard to find a price on a riding mower that's near 30 years old. Your guess is as good as mine....I guess I'd just like to ask you what you're willing to pay.
ALVIN=>It's a good machine?
TOM=>It's a good machine, Alvin.
ALVIN=>I've got three hunnert and 25 dollars Tom. And there's no fiction there.
TOM=>That sounds fine with me Alvin. Let's go and you can settle up with Alice.
ALVIN=>One last thing Tom. You can tell a little something about a machine this old by who's run it. Do you know who owned it?
TOM=>Sure do Alvin. Me.
TOM=>Well congratulations, Andy.
ANDY=>Thanks...Tom...but you sold it.
TOM=>No sir...you spotted the customer and brought him in...I just cleaned up. You go on and see Alice. Three percent on $325 dollars outta be enough for a pitcher of beer tonight...but there'll be more where that came from.
ROSE=>But Dad I was.......right. You ran into trouble.........the first....day.
ALVIN=>The only mistake I made was my equipment. I'm going to be fine now Rose. Nothing runs like a.....
ALVIN=>A Deere...Rose...Nothin' runs like a Deere.
ALVIN=>I gotta go just to give her something to chew on.
ROSE=>God.....I am.....so worried....about....... our dad. Please God....don't let nothin' .......bad....happen....to him.
CRYSTAL=>I couldn't get a ride.
ALVIN=>Hungry?
CRYSTAL=>Whatya got?
ALVIN=>Wieners.
CRYSTAL=>Wieners?
ALVIN=>Grab a stick and cook one.
CRYSTAL=>What a hunk of junk.
ALVIN=>Eat your dinner missy.
CRYSTAL=>How long you been out on the road?
ALVIN=>I've traveled just about all my life.
CRYSTAL=>I like being out on the road.
ALVIN=>It's different for a girl alone.
CRYSTAL=>It doesn't have to be different for a girl.
ALVIN=>Laurens.
CRYSTAL=>You got a wife back there?
ALVIN=>Nope.
CRYSTAL=>Kids?
ALVIN=>My wife Frances brought fourteen kids into the world. Only seven made it.... My daughter Rose lives with me.
CRYSTAL=>Five months.
ALVIN=>My daughter Rose that lives with me...she's what some people would call a little slow. But she's not. She's got a mind like a bear trap for facts and keeps everything organized around the house. She was a real good mom....had four kids.
ALVIN=>There was a fire. Her second boy got burned real bad. Rose didn't have nothin' to do with it.
ALVIN=>Not a day passes she doesn't pine for those kids.
ALVIN=>Well, I'm headin' to see my brother Lyle.
CRYSTAL=>Huh?
ALVIN=>I said I'm goin' to visit my brother Lyle in Mt. Zion.
CRYSTAL=>Where's that?
ALVIN=>In Wisconsin. Just over the state line.
CRYSTAL=>Oh....Cheddar Heads.
ALVIN=>Aren't those just about the dumbest things you ever saw a person put on their head?
CRYSTAL=>I hear that's a real party place, Wisconsin. Guess I'll never get to find out.
ALVIN=>I haven't seen my brother in ten years.
CRYSTAL=>You're eatin' a raw hot dog!
ALVIN=>I like 'em straight up.
CRYSTAL=>Ten years is a long time.
ALVIN=>There's a blanket in the trailer.
CRYSTAL=>What the hell kind of boom box is this?
ALVIN=>Eight track stereo...watch your god- damned language.
CRYSTAL=>Are these videotapes or what?
ALVIN=>That's music girlie.
CRYSTAL=>They're huge!.....I never seen anything like this.
ALVIN=>Good girl.
CRYSTAL=>Your brother.
ALVIN=>Lyle and I had a falling out.
CRYSTAL=>Over what?
ALVIN=>I can't say as I recall.
CRYSTAL=>Well that's pretty stupid. You haven't seen him in 10 years because of a fight and you can't remember what the fight was about?
ALVIN=>You got some rude habits girl.
CRYSTAL=>Sorry.
CRYSTAL=>So why are you going to see him now?
ALVIN=>He's sick.
CRYSTAL=>My family hates me. They'll really hate me when they find out....
ALVIN=>You didn't tell them?
CRYSTAL=>No...no one knows...not even my boyfriend.
ALVIN=>Well that doesn't strike me as fair treatment of your people.
CRYSTAL=>I can take care of my own problems.
ALVIN=>Don't let pride make you dumb. I should know.
CRYSTAL=>I don't know about that.
ALVIN=>Well a course neither do I but a warm bed and a roof sounds a mite better than this...eating hot dogs on a stick with an old geezer traveling on a lawn mower.
CRYSTAL=>No, I'll be fine sleeping out here. Looking at the stars helps me think.
ALVIN=>Sweet dreams.
WEST UNION POLICEMAN=>Please pull your vehicle off the road.
WEST UNION POLICEMAN=>May I see your driver's license sir?
ALVIN=>No sir.
WEST UNION POLICEMAN=>I'm going to have to ask you to step out...uh...get off of the lawn mower, sir.
ALVIN=>Nope, I'll tip over.
WEST UNION POLICEMAN=>OK Sir. I don't believe you have been drinking but I'm gonna have to ask you to stay here at Computer Cosmos for another hour or so...just 'til traffic dies down. That would be best for you and the other cars. Alright?
ALVIN=>Can I help Miss?
DEER WOMAN=>No you can't help me. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. No one can help me.
ALVIN=>What the......?
ALVIN=>What in the hell....?
STEVE=>So you're averaging about twenty miles a day?
ALVIN=>'Bout that. She'll go five miles an hour if I push 'er. I stop when my hips start barkin'.
RAT=>Wow man, five miles an hour.
STEVE=>So you're thinking about five weeks to get to your brother's place in Wisconsin?
ALVIN=>I haven't given it a schedule. That would sound about right.
RAT=>Oh man.....I could not handle five weeks on a lawn mower.
ALVIN=>And I couldn't handle sittin' on one of them seats for more'n an hour....if that. You all walk like you got a case of baboon butt. Seems my ride is a bit more comfortable.
RAT=>So why the lawnmower?
ALVIN=>Can't drive. My eyes. Don't like other people drivin' me where I want to go.
RAT=>I can totally dig that.
STEVE=>Can I ask how old you are Alvin?
ALVIN=>Seventy-three.
RAT=>Oh man. Seventy-three years old. Bad eyes, bad hips.
ALVIN=>Eyes, hips....diabetes....circylation. Can't hardly believe it myself. I'm older than I ever thought I'd be.
STEVE=>When d'ya know you're getting old?
ALVIN=>The first time I felt old was when I saw a buddy die in the war. I got old that minute.
STEVE=>There must be something good about getting old.
ALVIN=>Hard to imagine anything good about goin' blind and lame at the same time. But still...at my age...you've seen most everything life has to dish out. You can separate the wheat from the chaff. You know to let the small stuff fall away.
RAT=>Cool man.
BIKE RIDER=>Sally's in my tent.
RAT=>What's the worst thing about being old Alvin?
ALVIN=>The worst thing about being old is remembering when you were young.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Criminy sakes alive. You can feel the heat all the way over here.
JOHNNY JOHNSON=>Makes you appreciate what a volunteer fireman has to do.
DANNY RIORDAN=>That Rumelthanger place was an eyesore.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Remember old man Rumelthanger? What a dirty old cur...never bathed. The smell that came off that man. I tell you, it was enough to make a girl faint.
DANNY RIORDAN=>You always had an inclination to faint Darla.
JANET=>You know. There really is something about watching a fire that causes you to sort of go off...like it's hypnotism.
VERLYN=>Time was when all civilization did was stare at the fire.
DARLA RIORDAN=>What's that noise?
VERLYN=>Now what in the sam hill do you suppose...
JOHNNY JOHNSON=>What on earth....?
DARLA RIORDAN=>Honey bun...is that a lawnmower?
JANET=>It's going too fast for a lawnmower. Isn't it Danny?
DARLA RIORDAN=>And what on earth is drivin' that thing?!
VERLYN=>That sure as hell is a lawnmower.... with an old Indian on top.
JOHNNY JOHNSON=>He doesn't look like he has that thing under control.
DANNY RIORDAN=>...nothing runs like a Deere.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Mister are you O.K.?
JOHNNY JOHNSON=>Jeez Mister you're lucky she didn't roll on you.
ALVIN=>I think the belt's shot.
DANNY RIORDAN=>I wouldn't be surprised. You don't have brakes on that trailer do you?
ALVIN=>Alvin Straight.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Well Alvin...let's get you and this rig off the road and see what the damage is.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Well let's have a look at this mower. This is what? '65 ...'66?
DANNY RIORDAN=>Well I can tell you right now Alvin you won't be going anywhere tonight. Aside from your drive belt being busted, you've got transmission problems. Where were you hoping to get to?
ALVIN=>Mount Zion.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Mount Zion, Wisconsin? Past Prairie du Chien?
JOHNNY JOHNSON=>That's 60 more miles of hills.
DANNY RIORDAN=>That's across the Mississippi. What's in Mount Zion Alvin?
ALVIN=>My brother lives there.
JANET=>Why didn't you take your car?
ALVIN=>Don't have a driver's license.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Couldn't your brother come to visit you?
ALVIN=>He's had a bad stroke.
VERLYN=>Where are you coming from?
ALVIN=>Back a piece.
DANNY RIORDAN=>West Union?
ALVIN=>Nope.
JOHNNY JOHNSON=>Hawkeye?
DARLA RIORDAN=>Not New Hampton. You didn't come that far?
ALVIN=>Nope.
JANET=>Mason City!
VERLYN=>You've come a long way haven't you?
ALVIN=>Yes I have. From Laurens, Iowa.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Laurens?
VERLYN=>That's west of the Grotto. How long have you been on the road?
ALVIN=>What's the date today?
JOHNNY JOHNSON=>October 8th.
ALVIN=>5 weeks. I left Laurens on September 5th.
DANNY RIORDAN=>You been bunking in that?
ALVIN=>That's my rolling home.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Where've you been settin' up camp?
ALVIN=>In the fields. I'd just pull off the road every evening. I don't travel at night.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Weren't you scared staying out there alone at night? There's a lot of strange people everywhere now.
ALVIN=>Ma'am, I fought in the trenches in World War II. Why should I be scared in an Iowa cornfield?
DANNY RIORDAN=>Well why don't you bivouac right here in our yard tonight? We got a bathroom out here in this garage you can use.
ALVIN=>I appreciate that. I believe this machine is in agreement with you.
ALVIN=>Sure is nice of you folks to help me with this.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Well...there's a lot of rain in the forecast and you don't want to be stuck in your trailer.
DARLA RIORDAN=>I do a little woodwork art. I thought you might like some fish on your tent.
ALVIN=>My daughter Rose builds birdhouses.
DARLA AND DANNY=>Oh that's nice.
HARALD=>I tell you Thorvald it's a '65 John Deere 110.
THORVALD=>It's a '66 Harald. I fixed one just like it three years ago. That was a drive belt too.
THORVALD=>'66!
DANNY RIORDAN=>They're twins. Siamese, separated at the opinion.
DANNY RIORDAN=>So Olsens. How bad is it?
ALVIN=>I can't be dawdlin' here. I gotta get back on the road.
THORVALD=>Well you know about the transmission. The belt is shot, you blew a head gasget, you're in bad need of oil, and your right side tires are bald.
ALVIN=>Is that all?
HARALD=>Well it wouldn't be a bad idea to remove the blade assembly...As best as I can tell ...you're not mowin' any lawns.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Storm rollin' in.
DANNY RIORDAN=>It's going to cost him a bundle to fix that mower. I don't think he's got that kinda money.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Mmmm.
DANNY RIORDAN=>I wouldn't drive that old thing to Excelsior. It's a lawn mower for god's sake.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Mmm Hmmm.
DANNY RIORDAN=>He was damn lucky he made it to the bottom of that hill. He could've been killed. Easily coulda' been killed.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Yah. Ah huh.
DANNY RIORDAN=>He's none too strong. Did you see how he can't walk without those canes?
DARLA RIORDAN=>Uh uh.
DANNY RIORDAN=>The hills just get worse the closer you get to the Mississippi.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Go ahead and drive him honey. Mt. Zion can't be a half day. That's fine.
ALVIN=>I'm in need of a phone.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Why sure...come on in.
ALVIN=>I'd like to call my daughter and give her an account of my recent travels.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Sure, sure. Come on in.
ALVIN=>If it's all the same to you I was wondering if you have one of those phones without a cord.
DANNY RIORDAN=>The door's wide open...come on in.
ALVIN=>I can talk from out here.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Here you go. You're more than welcome to sit down at the kitchen table. Darla and I can leave the room if you're lookin' for a little privacy.
ALVIN=>Thank you. Out here's just fine.
ALVIN=>What area code am I in? I don't think this is 712 anymore.
DANNY RIORDAN=>No it isn't Alvin, that hill rolled you into 319. You'll need to dial a one and your area code to get her.
ALVIN=>I thank you.
ROSE=>Dad? Oh dad...I'm... ...so glad to hear you.
ALVIN=>That's right. I know I can count on you sweetheart...........I'm fine. I'm hobbled here but as soon as I get that check I can head out to Lyle's..........Are you O.K. there alone?...... Good, we can't have too many bluebirds in the yard.
DANNY RIORDAN=>What are ya cookin' Alvin?
ALVIN=>I'm making my Mexican coffee.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Mind if I join you?
ALVIN=>You'd be a guest in your own yard.
DANNY RIORDAN=>I talked to the Olsen twins and they estimate it will cost you around $250.00 to get this mower running again.
ALVIN=>That's twice what it oughta be. Must be because they're twins.
DANNY RIORDAN=>You know I'd be happy to drive you the rest of the way to Mount Zion.
ALVIN=>I appreciate the offer friend. I'd like to finish this my own way.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Even if you fix your mower there are hills bigger than Clermont's between here and Zion. There's no guarantee that your machine won't break down again. In fact I'll guarantee it will. Alvin, this machine was meant to go across a lawn, not the state of Iowa.
ALVIN=>You're a kind man talkin' to a stubborn man. This is a trip I'd like to finish.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Well then let me give you a loan for the repairs.
ALVIN=>Well that is generous. And if I needed that help I'd take it. But I phoned to have money sent to me. I gave my daughter your address. I hope that's O.K.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Well then Alvin you'll stay right here in our yard until you're ready to go. We enjoy your company.
ALVIN=>I'm thankful for that.
ALVIN=>Well you found me. It's alright ladies, I'm decent.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Well we had some brownies we thought you might enjoy.
JANET=>My mother's recipe.
DARLA RIORDAN=>She won't tell anyone what the secret ingredient is.
ALVIN=>Thank you Janet. Very much. I'll let 'em cool down a little...can't eat hot food. But I sure have a sweet tooth. I love brownies. Haven't had any since I went on the road. My daughter Rose makes a pretty good brownie.
JANET=>Does she live in Laurens?
ALVIN=>Yes. She lives with me. Just the two of us.
JANET=>Oh.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Well we'll be moving along. We just wanted to make sure you're doing O.K. Anything you need?
ALVIN=>No, thank you kindly.
DARLA RIORDAN=>Well don't you be afraid to ask now.
ALVIN=>I'm doing just fine. Thanks again.
VERLYN=>Janet give you a plate of her brownies?
ALVIN=>Her mother's recipe.
VERLYN=>Chocolate chips.
ALVIN=>Huh?
VERLYN=>The secret ingredient...no one's supposed to know.....chocolate chips.
ALVIN=>You've had enough rain this summer, have ya?
VERLYN=>Put up third crop hay last week.
ALVIN=>Dairy farm?
VERLYN=>Beef. I got too old for milking and both my sons moved to Dubuque.
ALVIN=>I worked cattle in Montana. Back when it was all by horse. Before the war.
VERLYN=>Army?
ALVIN=>Infantry. Third Corps.
VERLYN=>Under Bradley. I was Second Corps.
ALVIN=>I don't drink no more but I'm always up for a change of scenery. Thanks.
ALVIN=>Sittin' a little higher and goin' a little faster.
VERLYN=>Wait'll I get 'er over thirty.
VERLYN=>I can still have my beer but I can't drink the brown stuff anymore.
ALVIN=>I picked up a mournful taste for liquor in France. When I came back I couldn't drink enough of it. I wasn't worth a stick of stove wood. Mean. A preacher helped put some distance between me and the bottle. He helped me see that I was drinkin' because some of the sights I was still seein' from over there.
VERLYN=>Lot of men came back drinking hard. My brother Dewey did that. Spent most of his adult life drinking from noon on. He was an awful sweet drunk though.
ALVIN=>Everyone trying to forget. I can see it still in a man right away.
VERLYN=>Yup.
ALVIN=>It was one hard day after another hard day all strung together.
VERLYN=>Yeah.
ALVIN=>No, I'm good thanks.
VERLYN=>There was this one time...We were just ...waiting on our first warm meal in ten days.
ALVIN=>There is a thing I can't let loose..... All my buddies faces are still young...
HARALD=>You can work all day and you won't get that piece off with that wrench.
THORVALD=>Danny, did you hear me ask Wisenheimer there for his advice on how to fix a riding mower?
HARALD=>Fine. Then we'll all just stand here and wait for Mr. Wizard to finish...Anyone got a deck a cards?
THORVALD=>Very funny Harald. If it was you underneath here we could all go home and wait for winter. Then we could just put the snowplow on this rig.
DANNY RIORDAN=>Jeez you two can bitch. I heard you about killed each other last week over horseshoes at the Dew Drop.
THORVALD=>See Harald...brainiac...I got the mower assembly free with this little old wrench here you said wouldn't work...Well I'd say it worked pretty good, wouldn't you? Help me slide'er out here and we can settle up.
HARALD=>I got the labor and parts coming to $247.80.
ALVIN=>That's a little heavy for light work.
HARALD=>Well, now we did take them off of a resell, but the treads are good.
ALVIN=>Friend, are you chargin' me good or are you chargin' me new?
HARALD=>Uh, Thorvald?
THORVALD=>Well I guess we can make an adjustment there.
ALVIN=>I figure that adjustment to be about $30.00? Is that what your pencil's sayin'?
DANNY RIORDAN=>Sounds right to me.
ALVIN=>Now about that labor. I'm agreeable that you boys have put some real time in on this job. But a man's gotta ask when he workin with twins, especially a bickerin' pair, how much workin' was fightin'.
DANNY RIORDAN=>You got that right.
THORVALD AND HARALD=>Shut up Danny.
ALVIN=>If I were to judge from the joyous affair I've seen today I would calculate a 20% discount on the labor charge.
THORVALD=>Anything else mister.
ALVIN=>Now I'm not from these parts exactly but where I come from this is a mighty rich charge on a can of Iowa oil.
THORVALD=>Take the oil. No charge.
ALVIN=>Well that's a splendid offer that I very much appreciate. Now what's your tally?
HARALD=>Uh...uh.
ALVIN=>Done.
DANNY RIORDAN=>I've gotta tell you Alvin that I'm worried about you. About you...about your trip on that mower.
ALVIN=>Not to worry. Me and my machine are in splendid form after our stay here.
DANNY RIORDAN=>You're sure are you Alvin?
ALVIN=>I'll be traveling plenty early.
DANNY RIORDAN=>It has been a genuine pleasure having you here Alvin. Write to us sometime.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>Sir, are you aware of the congestion you caused on the bridge just now?
ALVIN=>I wasn't.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>I am assuming sir that you have the appropriate registration to operate a Slow Moving Vehicle. Am I correct?
ALVIN=>Yes sir.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>And where are you headed today?
ALVIN=>Mt. Zion.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>You are going to drive that to Mt. Zion? The Mt. Zion by Boscobel?
ALVIN=>Boscobel?
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>The Mt. Zion by Blue River? That Mt. Zion?
ALVIN=>That Mt. Zion ...yes.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>May I see some identification please?
ALVIN=>A bit west of the Grotto.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>And you've made it to Wisconsin with this setup?
ALVIN=>I have.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>It says here Mr. Straight that you are 73 years old. How long have you been on the road from Laurens?
ALVIN=>Goin' on six weeks.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>And what's your business in Mt. Zion?
ALVIN=>My brother is sick.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>Well Mr. Straight, we've got a problem here. All of this traffic that you've managed to stop runs right on through downtown Prairie du Chien. I'd like you to take the side streets.
ALVIN=>Well I'd like to accommodate you but...I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the streets in this town.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>You stay right here Mr. Straight. Don't move.
ALVIN=>That was a road kill.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>Mr. Straight, I'd like you to follow me.
ALVIN=>Are you arresting me?
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>No sir....we're escorting you.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>You take this up as far as 61, head north and it'll take you straight into Mt. Zion. Have a safe journey, Mr. Straight.
ALVIN=>Thank you for the grand parade.
PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP=>Our privilege sir.
PRIEST=>I noticed your campfire. I brought you some dinner...meat loaf and potatoes.
ALVIN=>I thank you kindly. Hope you don't mind my trespassin'.
PRIEST=>Not at all. You've made a fine choice. You're camped next to one of the oldest cemeteries in the midwest. French Catholic trappers.
ALVIN=>Marquette's party?
PRIEST=>Two of his men.
ALVIN=>Well you wouldn't be the first person to say so Padre.
PRIEST=>Fair enough. How far have you traveled?
ALVIN=>Well now this vehicle doesn't sport an odometer so I couldn't exactly say...but I been on the road since September 5th.
PRIEST=>But we're October 15th. Where in heaven's name did you start out?
ALVIN=>Back in north central Iowa. Laurens, Iowa.
PRIEST=>That must be over 300 miles from here!
ALVIN=>I reckon that's not a bad guess.
PRIEST=>Well I would guess that you are on a mission.
ALVIN=>You know I wouldna ever thought of it that way but I guess you could say that's exactly what I'm doin'.
PRIEST=>You say you've got to see your brother. Where is he?
ALVIN=>So close I can practically feel him... Mt. Zion.
PRIEST=>What's his name?
ALVIN=>Lyle Straight.
PRIEST=>That the fellow had a stroke some weeks ago?
ALVIN=>That's right. You know him?
PRIEST=>Well I do some work over at the hospital in Boscobel and I remember him coming in. He caught my attention because he lives in my parish.
ALVIN=>He's Baptist.
PRIEST=>I believe he told me that. He told me a few things as a matter of fact. Didn't mention having a brother though.
ALVIN=>Don't think we've either of us had a brother for some time now. I'm hopin' to fix that...
PRIEST=>I only saw him that once...never heard anything more.
ALVIN=>Lyle and I grew up close as brothers could be. We were raised on a farm up in Moorhead, Minnesota. Worked so hard...my ma and pa pretty much killed themselves trying to make that farm work.
PRIEST=>What happened between you two?
ALVIN=>Well that's a story old as the bible...Cain and Abel. Anger...vanity ...mix those things up with liquor and you get two brothers not talkin' for ten years....
PRIEST=>Well sir, I say amen to that.
WEATHER PERSON=>First frost of the season is expected for the midwest and great lakes region...
MT. ZION BARTENDER=>What the....
ALVIN=>I haven't had a drink in years but I believe I'll have a cold beer right now.
MT. ZION BARTENDER=>What flavor?
ALVIN=>What does a Miller Lite taste like?
MT. ZION BARTENDER=>Interesting rig you got out there. Make it up the hill OK?
ALVIN=>That one and about 200 others.
MT. ZION BARTENDER=>How far'd you come?
ALVIN=>Iowa. Headin' to Lyle Straight's place.
MT. ZION BARTENDER=>Iowa?...by God you must be thirsty.
ALVIN=>One'll do thank you. Can you point me to Lyle's place? I don't quite recall the way...it's been an awful long time since I seen him.
MT. ZION BARTENDER=>Cross 61 there on W. Take W to Weed Road and then take Weed on down to Remington. Remington drops down onto S...that's the county trunk by Frankie Schwartz's farm. On your right would be Lyle's place...if he's even there. I heard he's had a bad stroke...if you see him, tell him Micky O'Connor tells him to get better quick.
MARTHA=>I believe that would be a '66.
ALVIN=>Lyle.
LYLE=>Is that you Alvin?
LYLE=>Sit yourself down Alvin.
ALVIN=>I did Lyle.
