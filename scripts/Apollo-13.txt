TITLE:=>JULY 20, 1969 - HOUSTON, TEXAS
JACK SWIGERT=>- ...and the important thing when you're penetrating the lunar module is your attitude and your relative speed. Now let's say this is me here in the command module and this is you...
TRACEY=>- All right.
JACK SWIGERT=>- ...in the LM. This thing sticks out here in front; that's called a probe.
TRACEY=>- Is that true?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Absolutely. And, Tracey, I'll tell you, when you feel that thing slide in, everything's clickin'. It's like no other feeling in the world.
PETE CONRAD=>- A little liquid propulsion!
JIM LOVELL=>- What's the big occasion?!
JACK SWIGERT=>- Hey, How's it going over there at Mission Control?
JIM LOVELL=>- It's a nervous time, they're pacing around, smoking like chimneys, Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies. Jim Lovell.
TRACEY=>- Hi.
JACK SWIGERT=>- This is Tracey.
JIM LOVELL=>- How do you do, Tracey?
JACK SWIGERT=>- This... This is the man. Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8. They...
JIM LOVELL=>- Stop it, Swigert.
JACK SWIGERT=>- ... were the first ones around the Moon. This guy did 10 laps.
JIM LOVELL=>- With one hand on the wheel. You, guys, make yourselves at home. Hey, Marilyn!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Jim, where have you been?
JIM LOVELL=>- This is the last Champagne in the city of Houston!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Very good. Good, good.
JIM LOVELL=>- Everything else all right?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Everything's on course!
JIM LOVELL=>- Looks okay... Hey, Cadet Lovell!
JAY LOVELL=>- Hey, Dad!
JIM LOVELL=>- Put this on ice in the back with the rest and make sure it gets cold. You gonna get a haircut this summer?
JAY LOVELL=>- I'm on vacation.
JIM LOVELL=>- Oooh, get a haircut.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- I wouldn't mind being up there tonight.
FRED HAISE=>- God, who wouldn't? Don't worry. Our day's coming. They're not gonna cut the program before number fourteen.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- You know, my cousin called...
FRED HAISE=>- Uh-Huh.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- ... asked who we'd bribed to get on Jim Lovell's crew.
FRED HAISE=>- Yeah?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- I just told him: "They wanted to make sure he got the best!"
FRED HAISE=>- Well, they got that right.
JOHN YOUNG=>- What network do we want?
EVERYBODY=>- Walter! Come on, put on Walter! Jules Bergman! John. John, turn it up! Turn it up
PETE CONRAD=>- Everybody! I... I really appreciate you all coming to this dress rehearsal party for my Apollo 12 landing!
JIM LOVELL=>- Sit down, Conrad!
PETE CONRAD=>- Ah, I think we should all take a moment to... to recognize the exemplary... hell...damn near, heroic effort displayed by Neil Armstrong's back-up for this historic moon walk, and, of course, his crew... Let's hear for... let's hear for Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- There he is! There he is! Everybody quiet down! There he is! There he is!
JIM LOVELL=>- Hey! Kids!
PETE CONRAD=>- Jim, do you think it's too late for him to abort?
JIM LOVELL=>- No, no. He still has time to get out. He just needs somebody to wave him off.
EVERYBODY=>- Shhh!
TV)=>- Okay, Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- You're drunk, Lovell.
JIM LOVELL=>- Yeah, I'm not used to the Champagne.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Me neither. I can't deal with cleaning up. Let's sell the house.
JIM LOVELL=>- All right. Let's sell the house. They're back inside now, looking up at us. Ain't that something?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I bet Jenny Armstrong doesn't get a wink of sleep tonight. Ah, when you were on the far side on Eight, I didn't sleep at all. I just vacuumed over and over again.
JIM LOVELL=>- Christopher Columbus, Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong. Neil Armstrong. From now on we'll live in the world when man has walked on the Moon. It's not a miracle. We just decided to go. Apollo 8 - we were so close. Just sixty nautical miles down and... Mmm. It was like just step out, and walk on the face of it. I wanna go back there.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Where's my mountain?
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, it... It's right up by the... you see, okay... you see the... where the shadow crosses the white area there? That's the Sea Tranquillity. And your mountain's right there on the edge of that. Your mountain. Your mountain, Marilyn. Mountain Marilyn.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I don't see it.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, you gotta look harder... you look... While, I...
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Jim... Jim...
JIM LOVELL=>- The astronaut is only the most visible member of a very large team. And all of us, right down to the guys sweeping the floor are honored to be a part of it. What did the man say? - "Give me a lever long enough, and I'll move the world". Well, that's exactly what we're doing here. This is divine inspiration, folks. It's the best part of each one of us to believe that anything is possible. Things like a computer that can fit into a single room and hold millions of pieces of information. Or the Saturn V rocket. This is the actual launch vehicle that will be taking Alan Shepard and his crew on the first leg of the Apollo 13 mission.
CONGRESSMAN=>- When are you going up again, Jim?
JIM LOVELL=>- I'm slated to be the commander of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.
CONGRESSMAN=>- If there is an Apollo 14... Now, Jim, people in my state have been asking why we're continuing to fund this program - now that we've beaten the Russians to the Moon.
JIM LOVELL=>- Imagine if Christopher Columbus had come back from the new world and no one returned in his footsteps.
VOICE ON PA SYSTEM=>- Attention, all personnel! Clear level three. Clear level three.
JIM LOVELL=>- Are there any other questions?
WOMEN ON TOUR=>- How do you go to the bathroom in space?
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, I'll tell you. It's a highly technical process of cranking down the window and looking for a gas station which is... Oh, there's Deke Slayton. Deke, you might be able to answer this lady's question better than I. Deke is one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts, Ladies and Gentlemen. And now he's our boss. He hands out the astronauts' flight assignments, so naturally we kick back part of our salaries to Deke every month. How much this month, Deke?
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Jim, can I have a minute? Something's come up.
JIM LOVELL=>- Sure, you bet... Henry.
JIM LOVELL=>- Hey! Anybody home?!
BARBARA LOVELL=>- I'm not being a cheerleader, mom!. You don't understand, I worked so hard on this!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Barbara! Maybe, I don't understand, but you are not wearing that out in this neighborhood! That's the end of this. I don't wanna hear it!
SUSAN LOVELL=>- She's not even wearing a bra. You can see everything!
BARBARA LOVELL=>- Shut up!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Susan!
JIM LOVELL=>- Hey, everybody!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Jim!
JIM LOVELL=>- Marilyn. Trick or treat. You know that Easter vacation trip we had planned for Acapulco?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Uh-oh.
JIM LOVELL=>- I was thinking, there might be a slight change in destination.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Really?
JIM LOVELL=>- Maybe, say... the Moon... Al Shepard's ear infection has flared up. And we've all been bumped up to the prime crew of Apollo 13. Straight to the head of the line and the Fra Mauro highlands.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Six months. You're moving up six months?
BARBARA LOVELL=>- Dad! Can I please wear this?
JIM LOVELL=>- Sure!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Jim!
JIM LOVELL=>- No! No! Absolutely not!
BARBARA LOVELL=>- This stinks!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- They are not rushing things, are they? I mean, you're gonna be ready in six months?
JIM LOVELL=>- We'll be ready. Oh, hell, I wouldn't want to be around Al Shepard tonight. I gotta get over there. We're gonna have to get up the speed on this.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Go, go!
JIM LOVELL=>- I'm gonna walk on the Moon, Marilyn.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I know. I can't believe it. And, naturally, it's thirteen. Why thirteen?
JIM LOVELL=>- It comes after twelve, Hon.
TECHNICIAN=>- Apollo 13, you are go for pyro arm and docking. All systems are nominal and on the line.
FRED HAISE=>- Okay. S-IVB is stable. SLA panels are drifting free. The drogue is clear. The docking target is clear.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay, I'm coming up on that now. Two, one, mark.
FRED HAISE=>- Seventy-five feet. We're coming up on docking.
TECHNICIAN=>- Let's shut down some thruster on 'em.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Whoa. Wait a minute. I lost something here. I can't translate up.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston. We are drifting down and away.
TECHNICIAN=>- Roger that.
JIM LOVELL=>- Wanna just back off and make another run at this.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- No. I got it. I got it. Let me... I'm just trying to get it stable here.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston. I'm gonna reset the high gain.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- I've got the target back in the reticle. Okay. We're stable. Go ahead and recycle the valves.
FRED HAISE=>- Forty feet...
JIM LOVELL=>- They're all gray.
FRED HAISE=>- ... Twenty...
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Easy.
FRED HAISE=>- Ten feet...
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Captured.
JIM LOVELL=>- That's it... Ha! That's it.
FRED HAISE=>- Wooo! Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful. Beautiful.
JIM LOVELL=>- Gentlemen that was the way we do that.
FRED HAISE=>- Oh, man. That woke me up.
TECHNICIAN=>- Apollo 13 back-up crew. You're up in the simulator.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Nice job, Jim.
JIM LOVELL=>- That's 3 hours of boredom followed by seven seconds of sheer terror.
NASA DIRECTOR=>- Good job, guys. You just won the Christmas turkey.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Yeah, but it wasn't perfect. Used up too much fuel.
FRED HAISE=>- Aw, you're above the curve.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Not by much. Listen, guys. I wanna work it again.
FRED HAISE=>- Hey, we gotta be up with the dawn patrol headed for Bethpage, what, 07:00.
JIM LOVELL=>- Wheels up at 07:00.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Yeah, I know. But my rate of turn is still a little too slow there, I really think we should work it again.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, let's get it right.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay. Set it up again, Frank.
TECHNICIAN=>- Okay, thirteen back-up crew. It'll have to wait. Prime crew's up for another run.
FRED HAISE=>- Yeah, baby.
CAPCOM=>- Apollo 13 we show S-IVB shut down, and all systems are nominal. Fred, set the S-band Omni to B and when you get in the LM to forward.
FRED HAISE=>- Good shape over here.
JIM LOVELL=>- Hey, we got a problem. O2 flow high, cabin pressure, high.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- I've got no suit pressure.
JIM LOVELL=>- Ken, get your helmet on!
KEN MATTINGLY=>- I can't get it locked.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, we got a master alarm!
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Oh, God!... Help!
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Jim!
MARILYN LOVELL=>[wakes from dream]
JIM LOVELL=>- ... Something bad might happen. Stars will fall down on you or something.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- That's silly. Stars can't fall on us.
JIM LOVELL=>- Oh, you are a smarter kid than I was.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- How long will it take you to get to the Moon?
JIM LOVELL=>- Four days... But that's pretty fast, you see. This is the Saturn IVB booster, and it shoots us away from the Earth - pshhh... It's fast, as a bullet from a gun. Until the Moon's gravity actually grabs us and pulls us into a circle around the Moon, which is called an orbit. All right? Fred and I float down the tunnel into this guy - the lunar module. This is a spidery-looking guy. Only holds two people. And it's just for landing on the Moon. And I take the controls, and I steer it around, and I fly it down, adjusting it here, the attitude there, pitch, roll, for a nice soft landing on the Moon. Better than Neil Armstrong. Way better than Pete Conrad.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- Dad... Did you know the astronauts in the fire?
JIM LOVELL=>- Yeah, yeah I did. I knew the astronauts in the fire, all of 'em.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- Could that happen again?
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, I'll tell something about that fire. Um... A lota things went wrong...The door; it's called a hatch. They couldn't get it open when they needed to get out. That was one thing... And a... Well, a lot of things went wrong in that fire.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- Did they fix it?
JIM LOVELL=>- Oh, yes. Absolutely. We fixed it. It's not a problem anymore.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I can't believe they still have you doing public appearances.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, Henry Hurt was all over me.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I know, but...
JIM LOVELL=>- I couldn't get away.
JIM LOVELL=>- It's the program, Marilyn. It's... you know, it's NASA.
GUY IN CAR=>- Hey! Hey, you're Jim Lovell, aren't you? Ha, ha! Hey, lucky thirteen! Right on!
JIM LOVELL=>- Second time it's done that.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- So I was looking at the kids' school schedule coming up.
JIM LOVELL=>- Yeah?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- It's a very busy week. I'm thinking about not going to the launch.
JIM LOVELL=>- Huh!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- The kids need me at home, honey.
JIM LOVELL=>- Marilyn. We've had these kids for a while now. They've never kept you from coming to the other launches.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Yes, but now we have your mother. She's just had this stroke, and doing...
JIM LOVELL=>- Oh, Mom's fine.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Honey, it's not like I've never been to a launch before. The other wives' have not done three. I just don't think I can go through all that... I'll just be glad when this one is over.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, you're gonna miss a hell of a show.
PILOT=>- Jim!
JIM LOVELL=>- Hey, guys.
PILOT=>- Take care.
JIM LOVELL=>- See ya in a few weeks.
PILOT=>- Bring us back a moonrock.
REPORTER=>- So the number thirteen doesn't bother you?
FRED HAISE=>- Only if it's a Friday, Phil.
REPORTER=>- Apollo Thirteen, lifting off at thirteen hundred hours and thirteen minutes and entering the Moon's gravity on April thirteen.
JIM LOVELL=>- Uh... Ken Mattingly has been doing some scientific experiments regarding that very phenomenon, haven't you?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Huh, Uh yes. Well I had a black cat walk over a broken mirror under the lunar module ladder, it didn't seem to be a problem.
FRED HAISE=>- And we'd also considered a really helpful letter we got from a fellow that said we oughta take a pig up with us for good luck.
JIM LOVELL=>- There's nothing routine about flying to the Moon. I can vouch for that. And I think that an astronaut's last mission, his final flight... well, that's... that's always gonna be very special.
JIM LOVELL=>- I'm in command of the best ship with the best crew that anybody could ask for. And I'll be walking in a place where there's four hundred degrees difference between sunlight and shadow. I can't imagine ever topping that.
WALTER=>- We have that scheduled for 09:00 hours tomorrow.
JIM LOVELL=>- That's not gonna work, Walter.
WALTER=>- Why?
JIM LOVELL=>- Freddo and I are gonna be going over the lunar surface experiments tomorrow and Ken's gonna be back in the simulator. We're gonna be going over the flight plan tonight as well. I'm gonna pay a visit to this beautiful machine after you hard down.
CRAWLER WORKER=>- Okay.
JIM LOVELL=>- Thanks.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Jim! We've got a problem!
DR. CHUCK=>- We just got some blood work back in the lab. Charlie Duke has the measles.
JIM LOVELL=>- So we need a new back-up.
DR. CHUCK=>- You've all been exposed to it.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, I've had the measles.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Ken Mattingly hasn't.
JIM LOVELL=>- You wanna break up my crew two days before the launch. When we can predict each other's moves, we can read the tone of each other's voices.
DR. CHUCK=>- Ken Mattingly will be getting seriously ill precisely when you and Haise will be ascending from the lunar surface to rendezvous with him.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Jim, that's a lousy time for a fever!
JIM LOVELL=>- Now. Now look! Jack Swigert has been out of the loop for weeks!
NASA DIRECTOR=>- He's fully qualified to fly this mission.
JIM LOVELL=>- He's a fine pilot! But when was the last time he was in the simulator?!
NASA DIRECTOR=>- I'm sorry, Jim. I understand how you feel. Now we can do one of two things here. We can either scrub Mattingly, go Swigert. Or we can bump all three of you to a later mission.
JIM LOVELL=>- I've trained for the Fra Mauro highlands... and this is Flight Surgeon horseshit, Deke!
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Jim, if you hold out for Ken, you will not be on Apollo 13. Your decision.
["MAGIC CARPET RIDE"=>performed by Steppenwolf plays in the background]
TRACEY=>- Oh, let it ring.
JACK SWIGERT=>- I gotta take that.
TRACEY=>- Oh why?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Because I'm on the back-up crew. The back-up crew has to set up the guest list and book the hotel room... Swigert... Yeah... Yes... Yes, Sir... I... I understand... Thank you, Sir... AAAAY-HOOO!
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Well, I a... Damn. Medical guys. I had the feeling when they started doing all the blood tests that... I mean, I know it's their ass if I get sick up there but I mean... Jesus!... Oh, boy... Swigert., he'll... he'll be fine. He's... he's strong... It'll be a hell of a mission. One for the books... You're sure about this, Jim? I mean, why don't I go upstairs and talk to Deke? I'm sure we can work this out.
JIM LOVELL=>- This was my call.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Must've been a tough one... Look, I don't have the measles. I'm not gonna get the measles.
FRED HAISE=>- Ken, Wait up!
JACK SWIGERT=>- Trajectory's holding steady. We're right on the line.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, we're into program-64 . We're at 05 G's. So we're feeling that gravity now.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, we are at four hundred thousand feet passing entry interface.
PA ANNOUNCER=>- About to loose signal. Re-entry data are nominal and we have radio blackout.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay... What's the story here?... I got a corridor light, we're coming in too shallow. I'm going manual...
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, switching to SCS .
SIM TECHNICIAN=>- Roger, Thirteen.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Ok, we're three G's... Five G's... We're coming in too steep. I'm gonna stay in this roll, see if I can pull us out of it. We're eight G's... Nine... Ten... We're at twelve G's.
JIM LOVELL=>- Twelve G's. We're burning up.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Damn it!
SIM TECHNICIAN=>- I gave him a false indicator light right at entry interface. Even Mattingly didn't get it the first time.
JIM LOVELL=>- How ya feelin', Freddo?
FRED HAISE=>- Charbroiled.
JIM LOVELL=>- So what happened?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Came in too steep. We're dead.
FRED HAISE=>- No shit.
JIM LOVELL=>- Yeah, yeah. We were into program-67 there, so... Okay, guys, we're gonna do this again obviously but give us a minute to get our switches reset in here.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Jim, could we have a word?
JIM LOVELL=>- Sure, Deke.
PA ANNOUNCER=>- We're gonna drop off line and debrief with one of our...
DEKE SLAYTON=>- So?
JIM LOVELL=>- Well... If I had a dollar for every time they killed me in this thing I... I wouldn't have to work for you, Deke... Well, we have two days. We'll be ready. Let's do it again.
MARY HAISE=>- Oh, Margaret get them! Fred, Stephen, come here.
MARY HAISE=>- We can't go across that road! We don't want Daddy to get any of our germs and get sick in outer space, right?
FRED HAISE=>- Hey, boys!
FRED HAISE=>- Not givin' your mom a hard time, are ya?
FRED HAISE=>- Princess, you look beautiful!
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, hey, that looks like Marilyn Lovell. But it can't be. She's not coming to the launch.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I heard there was gonna be a hell of a show.
JIM LOVELL=>- Who told you that?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Some guy I know.
JIM LOVELL=>- You can't live without me.
PAD TECHNICIAN=>- Okay, folks. Let's say good night.
VOICES=>- Good night!
PAD TECHNICIAN=>- We got a big day tomorrow for these guys.
VOICES=>- Good night!
JIM LOVELL=>- You heard about Ken?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Yeah. JIM blows MARILYN a kiss from across the road.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- One, Two. Stand back, please.
JIM LOVELL=>- Ah, Guenter Wendt! [with heavy German accent] I wonder where Guenter went!
GUENTER WENDT=>- Jim... Ha, ha... You walk on ze Moon eh?.
JIM LOVELL=>- Ja, ja. We'll walk, and we talk on ze Moon.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- How do you feel? Pretty good?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Good. Might be a little warmer in here, huh?
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- How are you today?
FRED HAISE=>- Good.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- Ready?
FRED HAISE=>- Yeah.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- ...I'm gonna check off this list..
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- Okay, we have the oxygen purge system.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- We have the helmet restraint ring.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- Okay. ...activated.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- Communication umbilical on. Okay.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- Fred.
FRED HAISE=>- What?
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- Gum.
FRED HAISE=>- Aw, sorry. [spits gum in tech's hand] Thanks.
JACK SWIGERT=>- I'm gonna give these guys a beautiful ride.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- Sure you will, Jack.
WHITE ROOM TECH=>- You need more air?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- You want some apple?
MARY HAISE=>- Marilyn, hey!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Mary.
MARY HAISE=>- I hate this already.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- You're not just about to pop, are you?
MARY HAISE=>- No, I got thirty days till this blast-off.
MOCR OFFICER=>- This is from your wife, Gene.
GUENTER WENDT=>- Jim, you're all set.
FD LOOP=>- EECOM, you got everything you need? - Okay.
LAUNCH CONTROLER=>- Roger that, Houston! Pad Leader. What's your status?
FD LOOP=>- Stand by. - Roger that.
JIM LOVELL=>- Fuel pumps. This is it. A few bumps and we're haulin' the mail.
LAUNCH CONTROLER=>- We are go for launch. T-minus.
KSC PAO=>- 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6. Ignition sequence starts. 3, 2, 1. Ignition.
JIM LOVELL=>- The clock is running!
KSC PAO=>- We have lift-off!
LAUNCH CONTROLER=>- Houston, we have cleared the tower at 13:13.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Come on, baby. Come on.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Altitude is on the line! Velocity right on the line!
JIM LOVELL=>- Roll complete. We are pitching!
JIM LOVELL=>- Roger. EDS to 'manual'. Inboard. Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.
JACK SWIGERT=>- That was some little jolt?
JIM LOVELL=>- Tower jett!
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, this is Thirteen. We got a center engine cut off, go on the other four!
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, what's the story on Engine 5?
FD LOOP=>- Guidance is good.
JIM LOVELL=>- Roger that.
JIM LOVELL=>- Our gimbals are good. Our trim is good. Look's like we just had our glitch for this mission.
JIM LOVELL=>- Roger that.
JIM LOVELL=>- Coming up on twelve minutes thirty four. And...
FRED HAISE=>- SECO!
JIM LOVELL=>- Shut down.
JIM LOVELL=>- And that, gentlemen, is how we do that!
MARY HAISE=>- Oh, boy. I hope I can sleep.
MARGARET HAISE=>- Mom, that was loud!
MARY HAISE=>- Here, hold my hand.
MARY HAISE=>- I can't believe you did this four times.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- The worst part is over.
MARY HAISE=>- It is?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Listen. This doesn't stop for me until he lands on that aircraft carrier.
MARY HAISE=>- You just look so calm about it.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Well if the flight surgeon had to okay me for this mission I'd be grounded.
REPORTERS=>- Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise! Please, wait a minute! Can we just have a word with you, please?! Can I take a photograph?
REPORTER=>- How are you feeling?
MARY HAISE=>- We're very proud, and very happy, and we're thrilled.
FD LOOP=>- Flight, Booster, I show S-IVB shutdown.
FD LOOP=>- Flight, we have re-acquisition of signal at Hawaii. - Flight, everything looks good - Can't ask for much better than that.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay, Houston. CMP here. I've exchanged the couches with Jim. I'm in the pilot seat. And I'm gonna go ahead and get set for transposition and docking.
JIM LOVELL=>- Fred, are you okay?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay, we're ready for CSM separation.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, SM RCS ISOL valves are all gray. .
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, Swigert, Command Module Pilot. She's all yours.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, we've got good separation.
FRED HAISE=>- Translation looks good.
FRED HAISE=>- Okay, we're gonna start to pitch around to align up with the LM.
JIM LOVELL=>- You know Freddo, Frank Borman was up chucking most of the way to the moon on Apollo 8.
FRED HAISE=>- I'm all right. Just ate too much breakfast. Let's go to work.
JACK SWIGERT=>- And pitching up. Pitch rate - 2.5 degrees per second.
FD LOOP=>- Roger that.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Swigert can't dock this thing - we don't have a mission.
JIM LOVELL=>- How's the alignment?
JACK SWIGERT=>- GDC align... Thrusting forward.
FRED HAISE=>- One hundred feet.
JIM LOVELL=>- Watch the alignment now.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Hey, don't worry, guys. I'm on top of it.
FD LOOP=>- Fido, let me know when you're ready. - Okay, let's uplink that.
JIM LOVELL=>- How we looking, Freddo?
FRED HAISE=>- We're not there yet.
FRED HAISE=>- Forty feet... Twenty...
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Come on, Rookie. Park that thing.
FRED HAISE=>- Ten feet...
JACK SWIGERT=>- Captured.
JIM LOVELL=>- That's it. Talk back is barber poled
JACK SWIGERT=>- Go ahead and retract.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Houston. We have hard dock.
FD LOOP=>- Let's start back up with procedure 17.
FRED HAISE=>- Okay, Houston, we have LM extraction.
JACK SWIGERT=>- I gotta get out of this suit.
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, we are ready for the beginning of the PTC and I think once we're in that Barbecue roll, Jack and I will eat.
FRED HAISE=>- Hey, I'm hungry.
JIM LOVELL=>- Are you sure?
FRED HAISE=>- I could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros. [handover taking place in the MOCR]
JIM LOVELL=>- Oh, it's too bad we can't demonstrate this on TV.
FRED HAISE=>- What a shame!
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, overboard dump coming up.
FRED HAISE=>- Here it comes. The Constellation Urion.
FRED HAISE=>- Now, that's a beautiful sight.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Barbara! Barbara! We are going to your father's broadcast.
BARBARA LOVELL=>- No! I'm never coming out! I hate Paul! No one else can ever play another one of their records again.
SUSAN LOVELL=>- She's still going on about the stupid Beatles breaking up.
BARBARA LOVELL=>- They're not stupid. You're stupid!
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Barbara! I know you're worried but...
BARBARA LOVELL=>- I'm not going, Mom! Dad won't even know we're there.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- The whole world is gonna be watching this broadcast, young lady. And so are we.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, good evening, America! And welcome aboard Apollo 13! I'm Jim Lovell and we're broadcasting to you tonight from an altitude of almost two hundred thousand miles away from the face of the Earth. And we have a pretty good show in store for you tonight. We are going to show you just what our life is like for the three of us...
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Susan, Barbara.
JIM LOVELL=>- ... here in the vast expanse of outer space. Okay, one of the first things we'd like to do is provide you with the appropriate background music. So uh, hit it there, Freddo!
["SPIRIT IN THE SKY"=>performed by Norman Greenbaum plays on tape recorder]
FRED HAISE=>- Hello World!
JIM LOVELL=>- That was supposed to be the theme to 2001 in honor of our Command Module Odyssey, but there seems to have been a last minute change in the program.
HENRY HURT=>- Hey, Marilyn.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Where's their broadcast?
HENRY HURT=>- All the networks dumped us. One of them said we made going to the Moon about as exciting as taking a trip to Pittsburgh.
BLANCH LOVELL=>- My son's supposed to be on. He's in outer space.
ORDERLY=>- These are all the channels we get, Mrs. Lovell.
BLANCH LOVELL=>- It's that damn TV guide again.
JIM LOVELL=>- Jack Swigert, our command module pilot has requested ...
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Do they know they're not on the air?
HENRY HURT=>- We'll tell them when they get back.
JIM LOVELL=>- ...don't ya Jack?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Well uh, if anyone from the IRS is watching, I forgot to file my 1040 return and I meant to do it today but...
FRED HAISE=>- Well, folks, let's head on down to the lunar excursion module. Follow me.
JIM LOVELL=>- Now when we get ready to land on the Moon, Fred Haise and I will float through this access tunnel into the lunar module leaving...
KRANTZ)=>- ... Jack Swigert to pilot the command module, but until that time comes both ...
JIM LOVELL=>- ... spacecraft will remain connected. Well, folks, as you can probably tell the Aquarius isn't much bigger than a couple of telephone booths. The skin of the LM in some places is only as thick as a couple of layers of tinfoil and that's all what protects us from the vacuum of space. We can get away with this because the LM is designed only for flight in outer space... Fred Haise; Renaissance man. Okay, we'll head back up the tunnel now, and back into the Odyssey... All right, we've returned to the command... [loud BANG in spacecraft] Stand by one, Houston.
FRED HAISE=>- Gotcha! Ha, ha!
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston. The bang you heard was Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve. He really gets our hearts going every time with that one... Okay, we're... we're about ready to close out the Aquarius and return to the Odyssey. Our next broadcast will be from Fra Mauro on the surface of the Moon... So, this is the crew of the Apollo 13 wishing everyone back on Earth a... a pleasant evening.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- All right.
FRED HAISE, JR=>- Daddy was funny.
HENRY HURT=>- They might air a few minutes of it on the news tonight.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- You'd think so.
HENRY HURT=>- Bye.
BARBARA LOVELL=>- Bye.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, between Jack's back taxes and the Fred Haise show, I'd say that was a pretty successful broadcast.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Thank you very much, Houston.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Roger that. Rolling right, zero six zero.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Roger that.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Hey, we've got a problem here.
JIM LOVELL=>- What did you do?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Nothing. I stirred the tanks.
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, we have a problem. We have a main bus B undervolt. We've got a lot of thruster activity here, Houston.
JACK SWIGERT=>- What's the story with the computer now?
JACK SWIGERT=>- I'm checking the quads!
FRED HAISE=>- Christ, that was no repress valve!
JACK SWIGERT=>- Maybe, it's in Quad C.
JIM LOVELL=>- We've got a computer restart!
JACK SWIGERT=>- I'm gonna re-configure the RCS!
JIM LOVELL=>- We've got a ping light.
JACK SWIGERT=>- The way these things are firing it just doesn't make any sense.
JIM LOVELL=>- We've got multiple caution and warning, Houston... We've got to reset and restart.
JACK SWIGERT=>- All right, I'm going SCS...
DR. CHUCK=>- Jesus. Flight, their heart rates are skyrocketing.
JIM LOVELL=>- Let's get that hatch buttoned. The LM might have been hit by a meteor.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Yep!
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, we had a pretty large bang there associated with the master alarm.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, we have a main bus A undervolt now, too... It's reading 25 and a half. Main bus B is reading zip right now... We got a wicked shimmy up here.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Can't get this hatch seal!
JIM LOVELL=>- Just...
JIM LOVELL=>- Just stow it. If we'd been hit by a meteor, we'd be dead by now.
JIM LOVELL=>- I'm gonna try to get us out of this lurch.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, you're in the mud. Did you say switch to Omni Bravo?
FRED HAISE=>- Roger. And the signal strength on the high gain went way down.
JIM LOVELL=>- It's fighting me. What's the story here, Jack? We keep flirting with gimbal lock!
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay, Jim. SM RCS helium 1 - A and C are barber poled.
FRED HAISE=>- I'm having a hard time reading you there. Did you say switch to Omni Charlie?
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, I'm switching over Quad C to Main A.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay, Houston. Fuel cell 1. Fuel cell 3. We got a main bus B undervolt, cryo pressure, suit compressor. What don't we have? AC bus 1, AC bus 2, Command Module computer, and 02 flow high. I... I don't know. Maybe, this is a caution and warning failure.
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston... We are venting something out into space... I can see it outside of Window 1 right now... It's definitely a... a gas of some sort.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Give me an alignment
JACK SWIGERT=>- I'll tell you. We keep venting like this, we're gonna keep hitting the edge of that dead band.
JIM LOVELL=>- Is that what you get? Confirm.
FRED HAISE=>- We're not gonna have power much longer. This ship's bleeding to death.
JIM LOVELL=>- Are you saying you want the whole smash? Closing down the reac valves for the fuel cells' shut down? Shutting down the fuel cells. Did I hear you right?
JIM LOVELL=>- Yes, Houston, we copy.
FRED HAISE=>- Let's see what this does.
JACK SWIGERT=>- If this doesn't work. We're not gonna have enough power left to get home.
FRED HAISE=>- Shit!
FRED HAISE=>- Ah, Houston. O2 on 1 is still falling.
JIM LOVELL=>- Freddo, how long does it take to power up the LM?
FRED HAISE=>- Three hours by the checklist.
JIM LOVELL=>- We don't have that much time.
FRED HAISE=>- Shit!
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, now, Jack. Before the batteries completely die on us in here, let's... let's power down everything so we can save as much as we can for re-entry.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Right.
NASA DIRECTOR)=>- The Lunar Module's just become a lifeboat.
JIM LOVELL=>- We already have Freddo in the LM, Houston.
JIM LOVELL=>- How much time? Can you give me a number?
JIM LOVELL=>- We've got fifteen minutes, Freddo, it's worse than I thought!
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, beware I've moved from the Command Module into the LM.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Houston, this is Thirteen. Are you... are you back with me now?
FRED HAISE=>- I can't see any stars. Man, there's a lot of debris floating around out there.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay, Houston. I've completed the steps on page 15. Now I'm ready to power down the computer!
JIM LOVELL=>- I'm gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack! Before you shut down the computer!
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay, Jim!
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, our computer is up.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Fuel cell pumps off, O2 fans, tank 2 off.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, Houston. Check me. I have completed these gimbal conversions but...I need a double check of the arithmetic.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, the roll CAL angle is minus 2. Lunar Module roll is 355.57. Pitch 1678. Correction, pitch 167.78. Yaw is 351.87.
JIM LOVELL=>- We've got negative visibility in our star field, but if this paperwork isn't right, who knows where we'll... we'll end up out here.
JIM LOVELL=>- Log 'em in, Freddo.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Slow down. An electrical failure...
MARILYN LOVELL=>- ...what exactly does that mean?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- What do you mean there's no immediate danger. I just heard they're losing oxygen. Can they get back?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- No, don't give me that NASA bullshit! I wanna know what's happening with my husband!
JACK SWIGERT=>- Roger that!
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, wait!
FRED HAISE=>- Whoa! The RCS isn't up yet!
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, beware! Our RCS isn't up here yet! We have no attitude control on Aquarius!
JIM LOVELL=>- We're all out of whack. I'm trying to pitch down, but we're yawing to the left. Why can't I null this out.
FRED HAISE=>- She wasn't designed to fly attached like this, our center of gravity with the Command Module.
JIM LOVELL=>- It's like flying with a dead elephant on our back.
JIM LOVELL=>- Freddo, inform Houston I'm well aware of goddamn gimbals.
FRED HAISE=>- Roger that, Houston.
JIM LOVELL=>- I don't need to hear the obvious...
FRED HAISE=>- You are what? You want us to go to VOX, Andy?
FRED HAISE=>- Sorry, Jim.
JANE CONRAD=>- Marilyn... I'm sorry, Jeffrey's calling for you.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Jeffrey.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- Why are so many people here?
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Oh, well, you know, your Dad's flying his mission.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- He said he was going to get me a moonrock.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Right... Well... Something broke in your Daddy's spaceship. And he's gonna have to turn around before he even gets to the Moon.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- Was it the door?
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, Aquarius... We've had to learn how to fly all over again but we are doing better up here now.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Now... Do we know for sure that we can power this thing back up?... It's going to get awfully cold in here.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Roger that, Houston. This is Odyssey. Signing off.
JIM LOVELL=>- Freddo, we're gonna have to execute some sort of a burn here, it's just a matter of when.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Yeah.
FRED HAISE=>- Ah, Houston. How far off course do you project we are? Over.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- No...We can't do that...
GRUMMAN REP=>- We can't make any guarantees. We designed the LM to land on the Moon, not fire the engine out there for course correction.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Capcom, Flight, he says it'll be ready in time.
DR. CHUCK=>- I've run it by the FAO.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Do we know how long we're gonna fire that PC burn?
LUNNEY)=>- He specifically wanted a quote from the Flight Director.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- The President.
NASA DIRECTOR=>- Gene, I gotta give him odds. Five to one against. Three to one.
FRED HAISE=>- Okay, roger that, Houston. We'll hear from you again at acquisition of signal.
JIM LOVELL=>- You wanna look?
FRED HAISE=>- Oh, look at that.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Wow.
FRED HAISE=>- Mare Tranquillitatis. Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood. Coming up on Mountain Marilyn. Jim, you gotta take a look at this.
JIM LOVELL=>- I've seen it.
JACK SWIGERT=>- So long Earth. Catch you on the flip side.
FRED HAISE=>- Look, it's Fra Mauro. I can see our landing site.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Wow. Look at the Tsiolkovsky crater. I can't believe how bright the ejecta blanket is.
FRED HAISE=>- It's like snow... It's beautiful... That's Mare Imbrium to the north.
FRED HAISE=>- Good to see you too, Houston.
FRED HAISE=>- Gotta tell you, I had an itch to take this baby down though, and do some prospecting. Damn we were close.
JIM LOVELL=>- Gentlemen, what are your intentions?... I'd like to go home. We got a burn coming up. We're gonna need a contingency if we lose comm with Houston. Freddo, let's... let's get an idea where we stand on the consumables. Jack, get into the Odyssey and bag up all the water you can before it freezes in there... Let's go home.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Gene, Gene. We gotta talk about power here...
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Whoa. 12 amps! - How many? - You can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, John.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Never been tried before. - Hell, we've never even simulated it before, Gene.
JOHN YOUNG=>- Ken... Ken...
JOHN YOUNG=>- Good you're not dead. I've been trying to get in touch with you for forty five minutes.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- John? Jesus, John. What're you doing here?
JOHN YOUNG=>- I gotta get you in the simulators. We got a ship to land.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- What?
JOHN YOUNG=>- There's been an explosion, oxygen tanks're gone, two fuel cells're gone, command module's shut down.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- What about the crew?
JOHN YOUNG=>- Crew's fine so far, trying to keep 'em alive in the LM. We're gonna have to shut that down pretty soon too. We got a lota people working on numbers on this one, Ken. Nobody's too sure how much power we're gonna have to hit re-entry. The command module's gonna be frozen up pretty good by then.
SIM TECH=>- How much power do we have to play with?
JOHN YOUNG=>- They've been losing heat since the accident. They're gonna start getting a lot of water condensation on the control panels.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Ah, John's brought me up speed. What do we have left in the batteries?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- We gotta get started on some short cuts for power-up.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Well, that's all in the sequences, John. If we can skip whatever we don't absolutely need, and turn things on in the right order, maybe...
KEN MATTINGLY=>- You start on a procedure?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay. Frank. I need the sim cold and dark. Give me the exact same conditions they've got in there now and I need the present status of every instrument.
SIM TECH=>- You've got it.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- I need a flashlight. That's not what they have up there. Don't give me anything they don't have onboard.
SIM TECH=>- Let's get the show on the road. Put him in space, fellas.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, Houston. The Quad heater circuit breakers are open.
FRED HAISE=>- We're using the forward Omni when the earth's in the window, and we're switching to aft Omni when we see the moon.
FRED HAISE=>- Christ.
JACK SWIGERT=>- What's up?
JIM LOVELL=>- No more waste dumps. We're just gonna have to store it. Jack, we're gonna need some more urine bags.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, Houston. It leaves us with just the computer which I'm shutting down now... And that's it... We just put Sir Isaac Newton in the driver's seat.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Is it A.M. or P.M.?
DR. CHUCK=>- Haise is running a temperature and none of them have slept since the explosion.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- I can't order these guys to go to sleep... could you sleep up there?
MOCR ENGINEER=>- It's gonna get awfully cold in there for those guys.
DR. CHUCK=>- They're already up to eight on the gauges, anything over 15 and you get impaired judgment, blackouts, the beginnings of brain asphyxia.
LUNNEY)=>- Tell me this isn't a government operation.
DR. CHUCK=>- Those CO2 levels are gonna be getting toxic.
TECHNICIAN=>- Okay, people. Listen up. The people upstairs handed us this one and we gotta come through. We gotta find a way to make this... fit into the hole for this... using nothing but that.
TECHNICIAN=>- Better get some coffee going too, someone.
HENRY HURT=>- Good morning.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Henry! Don't you ever sleep?
HENRY HURT=>- I... I have a request from the news people.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Uh-Huh.
HENRY HURT=>- They're out front here. They wanna put a transmitter up on the lawn.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- A transmitter?
HENRY HURT=>- It's a kind of a tower for live broadcast.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I thought they didn't care about this mission. They didn't even run Jim's show.
HENRY HURT=>- Well, it's more dramatic now. Suddenly people are...
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Well if landing on the moon wasn't dramatic enough for them, why should not landing on it be?
HENRY HURT=>- Look. I... I realize how hard this is, Marilyn, but the whole world is caught up in it and it's... the biggest story since...
MARILYN LOVELL=>- No, Henry. Those people don't put one piece of equipment on my lawn. If they have a problem with that, they can take it up with my husband. He'll be home... on Friday.
JIM LOVELL=>- Hey, Fred. It's too cold in there... It's a nice one of Mary... You don't look too good, Freddo.
FRED HAISE=>- I'll survive.
JIM LOVELL=>- There's some aspirin in the medical kit.
FRED HAISE=>- I took some. Jim, I'm all right... It was an accident, Mary gettin' pregnant. You should have seen the look on my face when she told me.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, that has a tendency to happen.
FRED HAISE=>- Yeah... I wonder if it's a boy or a girl.
JIM LOVELL=>- You're gonna find out soon enough.
FRED HAISE=>- Sure... I never dreamed that I'd ever get to this something like this - come up here on a real mission. Most of the guys I graduated high school with never even left home... and here I am.
JIM LOVELL=>- Oh, yeah... Here you are...
FRED HAISE=>- It hurts when I urinate.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, you're not getting enough water.
FRED HAISE=>- I'm drinking my ration, same as you. I think old Swigert gave me the clap. He's been pissin' in my relief tube.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well... That'll be a hot one at the debriefing for the flight surgeon. That's another first for America's space program.
FRED HAISE=>- Listen... Uhm... I've been going over some stuff and I'm a little worried about this cold affecting our battery efficiency. See we quit heating the glycol to save water and power, so that's not helping us any.
JIM LOVELL=>- So it could cost us amp hours on the back end?
FRED HAISE=>- It's a possibility.
JIM LOVELL=>- We're working on something, Jack. Just hold on.
JACK SWIGERT=>- All right, all right.
FRED HAISE=>- I can't remember the ratio to temperature. We've got no references on board.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, let's see if Houston can pull up the mill specs on it and we'll...
FRED HAISE=>- What're you talking about? How did you figure that?
JACK SWIGERT=>- I can add.
JIM LOVELL=>- Jack, they've got half of the PH.D's on the planet working on this stuff.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston says we're right on the money.
JACK SWIGERT=>- What if they had made a mistake, all right, and there was no way to reverse it . You think they would tell us? There's no reason for them to tell us.
FRED HAISE=>- What you mean they're not gonna tell us. That's bullshit!
JIM LOVELL=>- All right! There are thousand things that have to happen in order we are on number 8, you're talking about number
JACK SWIGERT=>- And in the meantime, I'm trying to tell you we're coming in too fast. I think they know it, and I think that's why we don't have a goddamn re-entry plan.
JIM LOVELL=>- That's duly noted. Thank you, Jack.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Ow! God! Damn this piece of shit!
FRED HAISE=>- Hey! This piece of shit's gonna get you home
JIM LOVELL=>- All right.
FRED HAISE=>- That's because it's the only thing we've got left, Jack!
JACK SWIGERT=>- What're you saying, Fred?
FRED HAISE=>- Well, I think you know what I'm saying.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Now wait a minute. All I did was stir those tanks.
FRED HAISE=>- What was that gauge reading before you hit the switch.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Hey, don't tell me how to fly the damn CM, all right!
FRED HAISE=>- You don't even know, do you?!
JACK SWIGERT=>- They brought me in here to do a job, they asked me to stir the damn tanks and I stirred the tanks!
JIM LOVELL=>- Jack, stop kicking yourself in the ass.
JACK SWIGERT=>- This is not my fault!
JIM LOVELL=>- No one is saying it is. If I'm in the left-hand seat when the call comes up, I stir the tanks.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Yeah, Well tell him that.
FRED HAISE=>- I just asked you what the gauge was reading.
JIM LOVELL=>- All right...
FRED HAISE=>- And you don't know!
JIM LOVELL=>- All right, we're not doing this, Gentlemen. We're not gonna do this. We're not gonna go bouncing off the walls for ten minutes. 'Cause we're just gonna end up right back here with the same problems. Try to figure out how to stay alive!
FRED HAISE=>- No, we're not on VOX!
JIM LOVELL=>- Yeah, Houston. We were just looking at that. Our CO2 measurement has jumped four notches in the last hour.
FRED HAISE=>- That can't be right. I went over those numbers three times.
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, that's very comforting to know, Houston. What do we do about it?
FRED HAISE=>- Oh, Christ.
JIM LOVELL=>- All right, Houston. We're standing by for those procedures.
FRED HAISE=>- Christ, I know why my numbers are wrong. I only figured it for two people.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Maybe I should just hold my breath.
TECHNICIAN=>- Heads up. Heads up.
TECHNICIAN=>- Someone get that.
TECHNICIAN=>- Heads up, people. Look out now.
TECHNICIAN=>- That's what they gotta make.
TECHNICIAN=>- Right here.
FRED HAISE=>- Affirmative, Andy. Jack's got one right here.
FRED HAISE=>- He wants you to rip the cover off the flight plan.
JACK SWIGERT=>- With pleasure.
REPORTER=>- Excuse me, can you give me a timetable?
REPORTER=>- What about their level of carbon dioxide?
HENRY HURT=>- It's... uh, climbing.
REPORTER=>- You're saying that they're almost out of breathable air?
NASA DIRECTOR=>- No, wait a second. Wait a second. That's... that's not what he said. He said we're working on it.
TECHNICIAN=>- Tell him to use his arm.
FRED HAISE=>- Okay. Houston, I see what you're getting at, hold on. Okay, Jack. Tear that piece of tape down the middle lengthwise.
FRED HAISE=>- Hold on, Houston.
FRED HAISE=>- Shit, I tore it.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Shit.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, what do we do if we rip the bag? can we tape it?
TECHNICIAN=>- Oh, no.
TECHNICIAN=>- They should have one more bag.
SCHIRRA)=>- Well, they still got a long way to come and they are now working on their back-up facilities, their emergency facilities and the problem is if anything more goes wrong, they're in real trouble.
JIM LOVELL=>- One sock. Work it in.
JACK SWIGERT=>- We getting close to 15.
REPORTER=>- So how does this flight compare to other emergency situations you faced?
NASA DIRECTOR=>- Well, I have to say that this is the most serious situation we've ever encountered in manned space flight.
FRED HAISE=>- Houston, filters in place.
FRED HAISE=>- Cabin gas return to egress, suit circuit relief to close, CO2 canister select to secondary. All right, here it goes.
JACK SWIGERT=>- I can hear air moving
JIM LOVELL=>- Just breathe normal, fellas.
JIM LOVELL=>- Yeah, Houston. We're taking a look at those numbers right now... We're still holding close to 15, Houston.
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston. The CO2 level has dropped to 9... and it is still falling.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- Yes. Yes.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay, spacecraft control to computer.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Damn... We overloaded. We used way too much power and there must be a sneak circuit some place between steps 7 and
KEN MATTINGLY=>- No, not yet, John. It... The sequence was wrong. We just have to go back and try 'em one at a time.
JOHN YOUNG=>- You need a break, Ken?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- If they don't get one, I don't get one.
BLANCH LOVELL=>- Well, if it won't work, get me another one. My son's supposed to be on.
ORDERLY=>- I know, Mrs. Lovell.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Hi, Blanch.
BLANCH LOVELL=>- They can't fix a damn thing in this place.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Blanch. It's Marilyn.
BARBARA LOVELL=>- Hi, Grandma!
BLANCH LOVELL=>- I was gonna see Jimmy.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I know. I know. We came to tell you something. There's been an accident. Jimmy's okay. He's all right... But he's not gonna get to walk on the moon.
BLANCH LOVELL=>- Well, they said he was.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- I know. I know, uhm... That was before. Now there's been an explosion. And... they're all okay, they're all right. But now they're just going to... try to figure out a way to get them home. And... and it's a little bit dangerous. Oh, sweetie.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Roger that, Houston. That's wonderful news.
DR. CHUCK=>- Tell them they have to sleep. Haise is running a fever of a 104.
JIM LOVELL=>- Let's see how he feels about this. I'm sick and tired of the entire Western world knowing how my kidneys are functioning.
DR. CHUCK=>- Flight. I just lost Lovell!
JIM LOVELL=>- I'm not wearing my biomed sensors, Houston.
DR. CHUCK=>- Flight. Now I'm losing all three of them!
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, Aquarius.
JACK SWIGERT=>- What's up?
FRED HAISE=>- Something about another course correction.
JIM LOVELL=>- We copy, Houston. Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and I awhile to power up the computer for the alignment platform if we have to fire the engine.
FRED HAISE=>- We gotta do this blind?
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, without the computer, what do we use for orientation?
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston. What's the story with this burn?
JIM LOVELL=>- Well. Now look, Houston. All we need to hold attitude is one fixed point in space. Is that not correct?
JIM LOVELL=>- Well, Houston, we've got one! If we can keep the Earth in the window, fly manually, the co-ax crosshairs right on its terminator. All I have to know is how long do we need to burn the engine... The shorter, the better.
GRUMMAN REP=>- Gene, I want you to understand we've never tried this before, burn, cold soak, burn, cold soak, burn, manual control.
GRUMMAN REP=>- I just want you to know the engines never been tried like this. That's all I'm trying to tell you.
GRUMMAN REP=>- Okay.
JIM LOVELL=>-Okay, this gonna take all three of us. Freddo, you handle the pitch. But on the translation controllers all backwards so if the... the Earth starts drifting down you need to thrust 'aft' not 'forward'. I'll do the same on mine with everything else. We're gonna burn at 10 percent thrust for thirty-nine seconds, Jack, you time us.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Got it.
FRED HAISE=>- I'm with you.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, X plus button at 10 seconds. Mark.
FRED HAISE=>- Come on, baby. One more burn.
JACK SWIGERT=>- 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4...
FRED HAISE=>- Ullage is go.
JACK SWIGERT=>- ...3, 2, 1.
JIM LOVELL=>- Ignition.
FRED HAISE=>- She's burning!
JIM LOVELL=>- Oh yeah.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Master arm off.
FRED HAISE=>- Okay, here we go!
JIM LOVELL=>- Helium regulator on.
JACK SWIGERT=>- RCS is go, 10 percent thrust.
JIM LOVELL=>- Bring her around, Freddo.
FRED HAISE=>- I'm trying, but it's draggin'
JACK SWIGERT=>- 10 seconds.
JIM LOVELL=>- All right. Drop it down, Freddo.
JIM LOVELL=>- We're drifting! No hold what you've got. I'll roll it. Back off.
FRED HAISE=>- I can't get it stable.
FRED HAISE=>- She's dancing all over the place!
JIM LOVELL=>- Come to the right a little bit.
JACK SWIGERT=>- 15 seconds.
FRED HAISE=>- She's drifting, I'm losing attitude.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay. Hold it up there. Back No Freddo! Back!
FRED HAISE=>- Shit. I'm losing it!
JACK SWIGERT=>- 20 seconds.
FRED HAISE=>- Bring the earth up.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Forward, Fred, come on. Forward.
FRED HAISE=>- Shit, Shit. I lost it!
JIM LOVELL=>- Where is it? Where is it?!
JIM LOVELL=>- 7:00 helium regulator's closed.
JIM LOVELL=>- Bring it down, Freddo. Just nose it down
FRED HAISE=>- Uh Okay, I... I got it!
JACK SWIGERT=>- 30 seconds.
FRED HAISE=>- Okay, she's coming in.
JIM LOVELL=>- Little farther, ease your touch. Damn it! Damn it, that's mine. That's me around
FRED HAISE=>- A little more. Come on, baby.
JIM LOVELL=>- Come on. That's it. Hold it. Damn it.
JACK SWIGERT=>- 5, 6, 7...
JIM LOVELL=>- Back, back! That's it. Hold it. Steady.
JACK SWIGERT=>- 8...
JIM LOVELL=>- Steady.
JACK SWIGERT=>- 9.
JIM LOVELL=>- Shut down!... Houston, we have shutdown.
GRUMMAN REP=>- I knew it! I knew it! How 'bout that LM, huh? How 'bout it?
GRUMMAN REP=>- You betcha.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Here's the order of what I want to do. I want to power up guidance, ECS, communications, warm up the pyros for the parachute and the command module thrusters.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Well, they've been sitting at 200 hundred below for four days, John, they gotta be heated.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Well, if the chutes don't open, what's the point?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- They're gonna need all these systems, John.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay, I'm gonna go back and reorganize the sequencing again and find more power. Let's start from scratch. Clear the board.
JACK SWIGERT=>- How's it going, Fred.
FRED HAISE=>- I'm okay.
JACK SWIGERT=>- What the hell was that?
JIM LOVELL=>- Let's hope it was just the burst disk.
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, can you confirm a burst helium disk?
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, is that gonna affect our entry angle at all?
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston, uh... we sure could use the re-entry procedure up here. When can we expect that?
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston... We... We just can't throw this together at the last minute. So, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna get the procedure up to us whatever it is. And we're gonna go over it step by step so there's no foul-ups. I don't have to tell you we're all little tired up here. The world's getting awfully big in the window.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Jim, this is Deke.
JACK SWIGERT=>- They don't know how to do it.
JIM LOVELL=>- Hello there, Deke, what's the story?
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Jim, we're gonna get that power procedure to you, we're gonna get it as soon as we possibly can. Ken Mattingly's in the simulator right now.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Look. I know this sequence works, John.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- By, how much?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- God, damn it, John. Is it 3 or 4?
JOHN YOUNG=>- 4.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- 4 more amps... We know they have some power left in the LM batteries, right?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- We have an umbilical that provides power from the command module to the LM.
JOHN YOUNG=>- Right. It's back-up for the LM power supply.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- So... Reverse it. Reverse the flow and see if we can draw these 4 amps from the LM batteries before we cut it loose. Why can't we do that?
JOHN YOUNG=>- You're gonna lose a lot in the transfer, Ken.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Yeah, yeah. But all we're talking about here is 4 amps.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Gene. They're already...
DEKE SLAYTON=>- They're working on it now.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- IMU is up. How am I reading?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Say again.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay. Floodlights to fixed. Okay. I'm bringing up the guidance... Here we go... CMC attitude IMU, CMC source, CMC mode auto, and we're on the computer.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Go ahead.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Up and running. How do we look? John...
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Arthur, my notes are clear on that last sequence, right?
ARTHUR=>- Yeah!
GUARD=>- Your from building 5 right?
JOHN YOUNG=>- Excuse me, Gentlemen!
KEN MATTINGLY=>- I was getting a little blurry there.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Aquarius, Houston. Do you read?
JIM LOVELL=>- Yeah, we read you, Ken. Are the flowers blooming in Houston?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Uh, that's a negative, Jim. I don't have the measles... Jim, is Jack in there with you?
JIM LOVELL=>- Yeah, stand by one, we gotta get him on comm.
WOMAN=>- Put those on the table.
JANE CONRAD=>- Oh, damn it! Thanks Jackie.
NEIL ARMSTRONG=>- Yeah, yeah. We'll give it a shot.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Thanks... Blanch. Blanch, these nice young men are gonna watch the television with you. This is Neil Armstrong and this is Buzz Aldrin.
NEIL ARMSTRONG=>- Nice to meet you.
BUZZ ALDRIN=>- Hi.
BLANCH LOVELL=>- Are you boys in the space program too?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay, Jack. Give me a read back on that last procedure.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Stand by, Ken... Ken, I'm a... Well, I'm having trouble reading my own writing. I guess, I'm a little more tired than I thought.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Don't worry, Jack. I'll talk to you through it. Okay, find the main bus breakers on panel 11.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Yeah, main bus breakers. Got it.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Close main bus B.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Uh, Ken, there's an awful lot of condensation on these panels What's the word on these things shorting out.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- We'll just take that one at a time, Jack.
JACK SWIGERT=>- It's like trying to drive a toaster through a car wash.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Main bus B is closed.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay, Thirteen. We're coming up on entry interface.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- One more thing, Jim. While Jack's working on the power-up, we'd like you and Freddo to transfer some ballast over to the command module.
JIM LOVELL=>- Say again, Houston. Ballast?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- That's affirm... We gotta get the weight right. We were expecting you to be toting a couple of hundred pounds of moonrocks.
JIM LOVELL=>- Right, Houston.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Now, Jack.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Yeah, go ahead, Ken.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay, now... Panel 5. Circuit breakers 'caution and warning', main B closed.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Main B closed... Master alarm off...
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay, Jack. On panel 7, B mag number 2, power to warm up.
JACK SWIGERT=>- B mag number 2. Power to warm up. Done.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Sequential logic1 and 2 on.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Sequential logic... 2 on.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- CM RCS pressure on.
JACK SWIGERT=>- CM RCS pressurization.
REPORTER=>- As her husband prepares to jettison his lunar module lifeboat, Marilyn Lovell waits with her children, her neighbors, and we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Only the Lovell's eldest son, Jay, is absent as he holds vigil with his classmates at the St. Johns military academy in Wisconsin.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay, Jack. We're ready to see if the computer will accept uplink of the re-entry data now.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay. The IMU's up. We got our eight-balls back.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Copy that.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay, Ken... Uplink telemetry, command module to accept, right?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- That's affirm. Go ahead and try it.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Uplink completed.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Take a look at your amps. How we doing?
JACK SWIGERT=>- You got her back up, Ken. Boy, I wish you were here to see it.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- I bet you do.
FRED HAISE=>- Way to go, Jack.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Jim, we're ready for SM jettison!
JIM LOVELL=>- All right, Jack. On 3... 1, 2. Upward thrust!
JACK SWIGERT=>- We're loose!
JIM LOVELL=>- Reverse thrust!
JACK SWIGERT=>- We have service module jettison.
JIM LOVELL=>- Okay, Houston, our Service Module is free. We're gonna take a look at what we have here.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Copy that.
FRED HAISE=>- There it is. I see it.
JIM LOVELL=>- Oh. Houston. We're getting our first look at the Service module now. One whole side of the spacecraft is missing. Right by the high gain antenna the whole panel is blown out. Right up... Right up to our heatshield.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Uh, copy that, Aquarius.
FRED HAISE=>- It looked like it got the engine bell, too. Can you see that?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Oh, man. That's incredible.
DEKE SLAYTON=>- The heatshield.
NEIL ARMSTRONG=>- So Blanch. Blanch, did... did Jim make Eagle Scout or not?
BLANCH LOVELL=>- Yes, he did.
NEIL ARMSTRONG=>- He did?
JIM LOVELL=>- It's about time to bail out of this ship, Freddo. Freddo? You okay?
FRED HAISE=>- I'm, uh, I'm freezing.
JIM LOVELL=>- Can you old out just a little longer?
FRED HAISE=>- As long as I have to.
JIM LOVELL=>- Aw, come on.
FRED HAISE=>- Damn.
JIM LOVELL=>- It won't be long. Just a little while longer, Freddo...
FRED HAISE=>- Yeah.
JIM LOVELL=>- Just a little while longer. We're gonna hit that water in the South Pacific, open up that hatch. It's 80 degrees out there.
FRED HAISE=>- 80 degrees.
JIM LOVELL=>- You are a mess.
FRED HAISE=>- Yeah.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Odyssey, Houston. How we doing, guys? We're closing in on lunar module jettison. As you know, that is time critical. We should be making our move into the command module. Let's get the hatch buttoned up. And... when you get a chance let us know how you're doing.
JIM LOVELL=>- Roger that.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Here, let me give you a hand there, Freddo.
JACK SWIGERT=>- We're coming up on LM jettison.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Copy that, Flight. Thirteen, Houston. We're coming up on LM jettison.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Stand by.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Have you got everybody in the Odyssey?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Yeah, Ken. I wanna check those pyro batteries one more time... Okay, pyro batts look good. I don't think we have to tie the other batteries.
JIM LOVELL=>- Sorry, Jack. This is an old habit. I'm kinda used to pilot's seat. She's yours to fly.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Okay. Odyssey. I wanna double check some re-entry procedures right after we jettison the LM which is coming up in thirty seconds.
JIM LOVELL=>- What is that?
JACK SWIGERT=>- Oh... I was getting a little punchy and I... I didn't wanna cut the LM loose with you guys still in it.
JIM LOVELL=>- That's good thinking.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Stand by, Houston... We have Lunar Module jettison.
FRED HAISE=>- She sure was a good ship.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Farewell, Aquarius. And we thank you.
WOMEN=>- Mary... It's almost time, honey.
RECOVER CREWMAN=>- Flight 966, 406...
HENRY HURT=>- Let me put it this way. The trajectory may be off, their thrusters may be frozen, their guidance system might be malfunctioning, their heatshield could be cracked, and their parachutes might be three blocks of ice. Clearly we have got some obstacles to overcome.
REPORTER=>- Yeah, Okay. But now I'm asking you. When will we know?
HENRY HURT=>- Blackout lasts for three minutes. If they're not back in four, we'll know.
JACK SWIGERT=>- Okay, Ken. We are aligned for re-entry. Jim, we're gonna need that computer re-entry program. Fred, how are the batteries looking?
FRED HAISE=>- Okay. Batt A looks good.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Re-entry interface in one minute and thirty seconds.
FRED HAISE=>- Batt B, no volts, amps are okay. Batt C, shit. No volts, only two amps. They may die before the main chutes open.
JIM LOVELL=>- Roger. Let's tie all the batteries onto main A and main B.
HENRY HURT=>- RETRO says the typhoon is still a presence in the splash down area?
NASA DIRECTOR=>- Yeah.
HENRY HURT=>- Whata we got? the parachute situation, the heatshield, the angle of trajectory and the typhoon, there's just so many variables. I'm a little at a loss...
NASA DIRECTOR=>- I know what the problems are, Henry. This could be the worst disaster NASA's ever experienced.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Expect entry interface in 45 seconds. And on my mark your velocity will be 35'245 feet per second. Mark. 35 seconds to entry interface.
JIM LOVELL=>- Gentlemen. It's been a privilege flying with you.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Flight. We have loss of radio contact.
MOCR ENGINEER=>- It all depends on the heatshield.
JEFFREY LOVELL=>- Mommy, you're squishing me.
MARILYN LOVELL=>- Sorry, sorry, Jeffrey.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me? Odyssey, this is Houston, do you read?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read me? Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?... Odyssey, this is Houston, do you read me?
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?
JIM LOVELL=>- Hello, Houston. This is Odyssey. It's good to see you again.
KEN MATTINGLY=>- Odyssey, Houston. Welcome home. We're glad to see you.
WOMEN=>- They made it, they made it!
DEKE SLAYTON=>- Lunney!
JIM LOVELL=>- Houston. We're at stable one. The ship is secure. This is Apollo 13 signing off.
JIM LOVELL=>- Our mission was called a successful failure. In that we returned safely, but never made it to the Moon. In the following months, it was determined that a damaged coil built inside the oxygen tank sparked during our cryo stir and caused the explosion that crippled the Odyssey. It was a minor defect that occurred two years before I was even named the flight's commander. Fred Haise was going back to the Moon on Apollo 18, but his mission was canceled because of the budget cuts, he never flew in space again. Nor did Jack Swigert. Who left the astronaut corps and was elected to Congress from the state of Colorado, but he died of cancer before he was able to take office. Ken Mattingly orbited the Moon as Command Module Pilot of Apollo 16, and flew the space shuttle, having never gotten the measles. Gene Kranz retired as director of flight operations just not long ago. And many other members of Mission Control have gone onto other things, but some are still there. And as for me, the seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13 were my last in space. I watched other men walk on the Moon and return safely, all from the confines of Mission Control and our house in Houston. I sometimes catch myself looking up at the Moon, remembering the changes of fortune in our long voyage, thinking of the thousands of people who worked to bring the three of us home. I look up at the Moon, and wonder when will we be going back and who will that be.
