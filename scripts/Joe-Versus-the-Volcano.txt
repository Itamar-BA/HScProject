WATURI=>Yeah, Harry, but can he do the job? I know he can get the job, but can he do the job? I'm not arguing that with you. I'm not arguing that with you. I'm not arguing that with you
WATURI=>Who told you that? No. I told you that. Me. What? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.
JOE=>Good morning, Dede.
DEDE=>Hi, Joe. What's with the shoe?
JOE=>I'm losing my sole.
DEDE=>Yeah. How you doin'?
JOE=>I'm a little tired.
DEDE=>Yeah. Here. Each one gets sent five catalogs.
JOE=>Can't do it.
DEDE=>Why not?
JOE=>I only got twelve catalogs left altogether.
DEDE=>Okay.
WATURI=>How you doin', Joe?
JOE=>Well, I'm not feeling very good, Mr. Waturi.
WATURI=>So what else is new? You never feel good.
JOE=>Yeah. Well. That's the problem. Anyway, I got the doctor's appointment today.
WATURI=>Another doctor's appointment?
JOE=>Yeah.
WATURI=>Listen, Joe. What's this Dede tells me about the catalogs?
JOE=>I've only got twelve.
WATURI=>How'd you let us get down to twelve?
JOE=>I told you.
WATURI=>When?
JOE=>Three weeks ago. Then two weeks ago.
WATURI=>Did you tell me last week?
JOE=>No.
WATURI=>Why not?
JOE=>I don't know. I thought you knew.
WATURI=>Not good enough, Joe! Not nearly good enough! I put you in charge of the entire advertising library...
JOE=>You mean, this room.
WATURI=>I gave you carte blanche how to deal with the materials in here...
JOE=>You put the orders into the printer, Mr. Waturi, not me. That's how you wanted it.
WATURI=>You're not competent to put the orders into the printer! That's a very technical...
JOE=>I thought you were going to explain it to me.
WATURI=>I was going to do better than that. I was going to make you assistant manager. I want to make you assistant manager. But you, you're not flexible! You're inflexible.
JOE=>I don't feel inflexible.
WATURI=>You're inflexible. Totally. And this doctor appointment! You're always going to the doctor!
JOE=>I don't feel good.
WATURI=>So what! Do you think I feel good? Nobody feels good. After childhood, it's a fact of life. I feel rotten. So what? I don't let it bother me. I don't let it interfere with my job.
JOE=>What do you want from me, Mr. Waturi?
WATURI=>You're like a child. What's this lamp for? Isn't there enough light in here?
JOE=>These fluorescent lights affect me. They make me feel blotchy, puffy. I thought this light would...
WATURI=>Get rid of the light. This isn't your bedroom, this is an office. Maybe if you start treating this like a job instead of some kind of welfare hospital, you'll shape up. And I want those catalogs.
JOE=>Then please order them.
WATURI=>Watch yourself, Joe. Think about what I've said. You've gotta get yourself into a flexible frame or you're no place.
WATURI=>Take that light off your desk.
JOE=>I will.
WATURI=>Take it off now.
WATURI=>Good.
JOE=>Advertising library. Fifty? I'm sorry, we don't have that many in stock. I don't know why. The catalog is a thing... I don't know. It's here and it's gone. I can't explain. It's a mystery.
DEDE=>Why do you let Waturi talk to you like that?
JOE=>Like what?
DEDE=>What's wrong with you?
JOE=>I don't... feel very good.
DEDE=>What's the matter with you?
JOE=>I don't know.
JOE=>I don't know.
NURSE=>Mr. Banks? Mr. Banks?
JOE=>Yeah?
NURSE=>Doctor Ellison will see you now. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 5/16/89 9.
ELLISON=>How are you feeling, Mr. Banks?
JOE=>Pretty much the same. I feel puffy, blotchy. I never seem to have very much energy. I get these little sore throats. I just don't feel good.
ELLISON=>And how long have you felt this way?
JOE=>Well. Pretty much since I left the Fire Department. On and off. But since then. 'Bout eight years.
ELLISON=>What did you do in the Fire Department?
JOE=>Well, ah, you know, I put out fires.
ELLISON=>Was it dangerous?
JOE=>Yeah. Ahm, pretty rough stuff. But I came out of it okay. The hard part was not feeling good all the time. I started not feeling good all the time. So I hadda quit.
ELLISON=>Yes. I've gotten the results of your tests.
JOE=>I've got cancer.
ELLISON=>No.
JOE=>This new venereal...
ELLISON=>No.
JOE=>Is there something wrong with my blood or urine or...?
ELLISON=>No, they're fine. But there is something.
JOE=>Tell me.
ELLISON=>You have a brain cloud.
JOE=>A brain cloud.
ELLISON=>There's a black fog of tissue running right down the center of your brain. It's very rare. It will spread at a regular rate. It's very destructive.
JOE=>And it's incurable.
ELLISON=>Yes.
JOE=>How long?
ELLISON=>Six months. You can pretty much count on it being about that. It's not painful. Your brain will simply fail. Followed abruptly by your body. You can depend on at least four and half or five months of perfect health. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 6/2/89 11.
JOE=>But what are you talking about, Doctor? I don't feel good right now.
ELLISON=>That's the ironic part, really. Mr. Banks, you're a hypochondriac. There's nothing wrong with you that has anything to do with your symptoms. My guess is your experiences in the Fire Department were extremely traumatic. You experienced the imminent possibility of death. Several times? You survived. But the cumulative anxiety of those brushes with death left you habitually fearful. About your physical person.
JOE=>I'm not sick? Except for this terminal disease?
ELLISON=>Which has no symptoms. That's right. It was only because of your insistence on having so many tests that we happened to discover the problem.
JOE=>What am I going to do?
ELLISON=>Well, if you have any savings you might think about taking a trip, a vacation?
JOE=>I don't have any savings. A few hundred bucks. I've spent everything on doctors.
ELLISON=>Yes. Perhaps you'll want a second opinion?
JOE=>A brain cloud. I knew it. Well, I didn't know it, but I knew it. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 5/16/89 12.
ELLISON=>Yes.
JOE=>What am I going to do?
ELLISON=>You have some time left, Mr. Banks. You have some life left. My advice to you is: Live it well.
JOE=>I've got to go. I'm on my lunch hour which is over.
ELLISON=>I'm sorry for what I had to tell you. I wish the news had been better.
JOE=>Yeah .
JOE=>I'm sorry I didn't shake your hand.
JOE=>What's your name?
GUARD=>Fred.
JOE=>Fred.
WATURI=>No. No. You were wrong. He was wrong. Who said that? I didn't say that. If I had said that, I would've been wrong. I would've been wrong, Harry, isn't that right?
WATURI=>Listen, let me call you back, I've got something here, okay? And don't tell him anything till we finish our conversation, okay?
WATURI=>Joe?
JOE=>Yeah?
WATURI=>You were at lunch three hours.
JOE=>About that.
WATURI=>Joe, what are you doing?
JOE=>I'm opening, or closing, the main drain.
WATURI=>You shouldn't be touching that.
JOE=>Nothing happened. Do you know how long I've been wondering what would happen if I did that?
WATURI=>What's the matter with you?
JOE=>Brain cloud.
WATURI=>What?
JOE=>Never mind. Listen, Mr. Waturi. Frank. I quit. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 5/16/89 15.
WATURI=>You mean, today?
JOE=>That's right.
WATURI=>That's great. Well, don't come looking for a reference.
JOE=>Okay, I won't.
WATURI=>You blew this job.
JOE=>I've been here for four and a half years. The work I did I probably could've done in five, six months. That leaves four years leftover.
JOE=>Four years. If I had them now. Like gold in my hand. Here. This is for you. 'Bye-bye, Dede.
DEDE=>You're going?
WATURI=>Well, if you're leaving, leave. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 6/2/89 16.
WATURI=>You'll get your check. And, I promise you, you'll be easy to replace.
JOE=>I should say something.
WATURI=>What are you talking about?
JOE=>This life. Life? What a joke. This situation This room.
WATURI=>Joe, maybe you should just...
JOE=>You look terrible, Mr. Waturi. You look like a bag of shit stuffed inna cheap suit. Not that anyone would look good under these zombie lights. I can feel them sucking the juice outta my eyeballs. Three hundred bucks a week, that's the news. For three hundred bucks a week I've lived in this sink. This used rubber.
WATURI=>Watch it, mister! There's a woman here!
JOE=>Don't you think I know that, Frank? Don't you think I'm aware there's a woman here? I can taste her on my tongue. I can smell her. When I'm twenty feet away, I can hear the fabric of her dress when she moves in her chair. Not that I've done anything about it. I've gone all day, every day, not doing, not saying, not taking the chance for three hundred bucks a week, and Frank the coffee stinks it's like arsenic, the lights give me a headache if the lights don't give you a headache you must be dead, let's arrange the funeral.
WATURI=>You better get outta here right now! I'm telling you!
JOE=>You're telling me nothing.
WATURI=>I'm telling you!
JOE=>And why, I ask myself, why have I put up with you? I can't imagine but I know. Fear. Yellow freakin' fear. I've been too chicken shit afraid to live my life so I sold it to you for three hundred freakin' dollars a week! You're lucky I don't kill you! You're lucky I don't rip your freakin' throat out! But I'm not going to and maybe you're not so lucky at that. 'Cause I'm gonna leave you here, Mister Wa-a-Waturi, and what could be worse than that?
JOE=>Dede?
DEDE=>Yeah?
JOE=>How 'bout dinner tonight?
DEDE=>Yeah, uh, okay.
DEDE=>Wow. What a change.
WATURI=>Who does he think he is?
JOE=>I mean, who am I? That's the real question, isn't it? Who am I? Who are you? What other questions are there? What other questions are there, really? If you want to understand the universe, embrace the universe, the door to the universe is you!
DEDE=>Me?
JOE=>You. Me.
DEDE=>You are really intense.
JOE=>Am I? I guess I am. I was.
DEDE=>What do you mean?
JOE=>I mean, a long time ago. In the beginning. I was full of piss and vinegar. Nothing got me down. I wanted to know!
DEDE=>You wanted to know what?
JOE=>Everything! But then, I had some experiences... I was talking to this guy today, he says I got scared.
DEDE=>Scared of what?
JOE=>Have you ever been scared?
DEDE=>I guess so. Sure.
JOE=>What scared you?
DEDE=>A lot of things. At the moment, you scare me a little bit.
JOE=>Me?
DEDE=>Yeah.
JOE=>Why would I scare you?
DEDE=>I don't know. There's something going on with you. This morning you were like a lump and now you're... How do you feel?
JOE=>I feel great.
DEDE=>See? You never feel great.
JOE=>No, I never do.
DEDE=>What's funny?
JOE=>I do feel great. And that is very funny!
DEDE=>Where are you?
JOE=>I'm right here.
DEDE=>I wish I was where you are, Joe.
JOE=>No, you don't. Did I ever tell you that the first time I saw you, I felt I'd seen you before?
JOE=>Wait a minute.
DEDE=>What'd you do?
JOE=>I bribed them to sing a song that would drive us insane and make our hearts swell and burst.
JOE=>Listen.
DEDE=>What happened to you?
JOE=>Huh?
DEDE=>What happened to you that you're ... so alive? I can see it.
JOE=>The doctor told me I've got this thing wrong with my brain. It's not catching. But I've just got five or six months to live.
DEDE=>What?
JOE=>I'm gonna die. And it's made me. very appreciative of my life.
DEDE=>I've gotta go.
JOE=>Please don't.
DEDE=>I've gotta go home. You may've quit, but I got the job in the morning.
JOE=>Dede, I really want you to stay.
DEDE=>You're gonna die?
JOE=>Yeah, but so what? Stay! Just tonight. Tomorrow'll take care of itself.
DEDE=>I can't handle it, Joe. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 5/16/89 21A.
DEDE=>Sorry.
GRAYNAMORE=>Joe Banks? Mr. Joe Banks?
JOE=>Yeah?
GRAYNAMORE=>Have I come at a bad time?
JOE=>Yeah. No. I don't know how to answer that question.
GRAYNAMORE=>Can I come in? Can we talk?
GRAYNAMORE=>You're not dressed?
JOE=>No.
GRAYNAMORE=>Doesn't bother me if it doesn't bother you.
GRAYNAMORE=>Not a nice place you have here, Joe. Mind if I call you Joe?
JOE=>No.
GRAYNAMORE=>Dingy, shabby, dinky, not much.
GRAYNAMORE=>I see it as a sign of tremendous sophistication that you haven't demanded my name or asked me what I'm doing here. My name is Samuel Harvey Graynamore.
JOE=>Joe Banks.
GRAYNAMORE=>I know. I'm trying to see the hero in there.
JOE=>What do you mean?
GRAYNAMORE=>You dragged two kids down a six-story burning staircase. That was brave. But then you went back up for the third. That was heroic. Com'on, you're a hero.
JOE=>That was a long time ago.
GRAYNAMORE=>Yes, it was.
JOE=>How do you know my name?
GRAYNAMORE=>I know all about you. As much as I could learn in twenty- four hours, anyway. Peanuts?
JOE=>No.
GRAYNAMORE=>Quit your job, huh?
JOE=>Yeah.
GRAYNAMORE=>Well, sounded like a dumb job. No family?
JOE=>No.
GRAYNAMORE=>Good for you. Families are a pain in the neck. What do you know about superconductors ?
JOE=>Nothing.
GRAYNAMORE=>Me neither. But I own a huge company that dominates the world market for superconductors.
JOE=>Really.
GRAYNAMORE=>Yes. Sit down.
GRAYNAMORE=>I got a call from Dr. Ellison. You were at his office yesterday?
GRAYNAMORE=>He told me your news. I hope you won't be angry with him. He thought you and I might be able to help each other. Got any whiskey?
GRAYNAMORE=>I want to hire you, Joe Banks. I want you...
GRAYNAMORE=>to jump into a volcano.
JOE=>I do have some whiskey.
GRAYNAMORE=>There's an island in the South Pacific called Waponi Woo. The name means 'The Little Island With the Big Volcano.' The Waponis are a cheerful people who live a simple existence fishing in the lagoon and picking fruit. They have one fear. That's a big volcano, they call it The Big Woo. They believe an angry fire god in the volcano will sink the island unless, once every hundred years, he is appeased. It's been ninety-nine years, eleven months, and eleven days since the fire god got his propers and the Waponis are scared.
JOE=>How's the god appeased?
GRAYNAMORE=>Of his own free will, a man's got to jump into the volcano. Now as you might imagine, none of the Waponis are anxious to volunteer for the honor of jumping into the Big Woo. And the problem is that whoever does it gotta do it of his own free will so what do you do?
JOE=>What do you do?
GRAYNAMORE=>You do some tradin'. There's a mineral on that island, Mr. Banks. It's called bubureau. I don't know anywhere else on the planet where you can find more than a gram of this stuff, and believe me I've looked. Because without bubureau I can't make my superconductors. I've tried to get the mineral rights from the Waponis, but I don't seem to have anything they want. But they do want a hero, Mr. Banks. And they'll give me the mineral rights if I find them one.
JOE=>Why would I jump into a volcano? JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 6/2/89 27.
GRAYNAMORE=>From your exploits in the Fire Department, I think you've got the courage.
JOE=>You do?
GRAYNAMORE=>Does it take more guts to twice traverse a staircase in flames, or to make a onetime leap into the mouth of a smoking volcano? Damned if I know, kimosabe. All I know is when you're making those kind of calls, you're up in the high country. From your doctor, you know you're on your way out anyway. You haven't got any money. I checked. Do you want to wait it out here, in this apartment? That sounds kind a grim to me. It's not how I'd wanna go, I'll tell you that.
GRAYNAMORE=>These are yours if you take the job. It'd be twenty days from today before you'd have to actually jump in the Big Woo. You could shop today, get yourself some clothes, you know, for an adventure. Then tomorrow a plane to L.A. first class, naturally. You'll be met. Stay in the best hotel. Then the next day, you board a yacht. My competitors sometimes watch the airports. The yacht's a real beauty. It belongs to me. Gourmet chef.
GRAYNAMORE=>You sail to the South Pacific. Then, fifteen days. The Waponis come out to meet you, a total red carpet situation, you're a national hero. You're Charles Lindbergh. It's wine, women and song in the sweetest little paradise you ever saw. Then you jump in the volcano. Live like a king, die like a man, that's what I say. What do you say?
JOE=>Alright. I'll do it.
GRAYNAMORE=>Here's my card and your plane ticket. American, noon out of Kennedy tomorrow.
JOE=>Mr. Graynamore?
GRAYNAMORE=>Yes?
JOE=>What if I use the cards and take the plane and go on the yacht and party on the island and then I change my mind and I don't jump in the volcano?
GRAYNAMORE=>Why then I'd kill you in a very slow and painful way. But you'll jump.
JOE=>Hi, I'd like to rent a limousine JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 5/16/89 A28A.
JOE=>Thank you? Yes, I do. American Express. The Gold Card. Can I have a white limousine?
MARSHALL=>So where would you like to go?
JOE=>Excuse me?
MARSHALL=>Where would you like to go, sir?
JOE=>I thought I might like to do some shopping.
MARSHALL=>Okay. Where would you like to go shopping?
JOE=>I don't know.
MARSHALL=>Alright.
JOE=>Where would you go shopping?
MARSHALL=>For what? What do you need?
JOE=>Clothes.
MARSHALL=>What kind of clothes? What is your taste?
JOE=>I don't exactly know.
JOE=>Why'd you stop?
MARSHALL=>I'm just hired to drive the car, mister. I'm not here to tell you who you are.
JOE=>I didn't ask you to tell me who I am.
MARSHALL=>You were hinting around about clothes. It happens that clothes are very important to me, Mister..
JOE=>Banks.
MARSHALL=>Banks. Clothes make the man. I believe that. You say to me you wanna go shopping, you wanna buy clothes, but you don't know what kind. You leave that hanging in the air, like I'm going to fill in the blank, that to me is like asking me who you are, and I don't know who you are, I don't wanna know. It's taken me my whole life to find out who I am and I'm tired now, you hear what I'm say in'? What's your name?
JOE=>Joe.
MARSHALL=>My name's Marshall, how you do?
MARSHALL=>Wait a minute. I'm coming back.
MARSHALL=>Now what's your situation? Explain your situation to me?
JOE=>I'm going away on a long trip.
MARSHALL=>Okay.
JOE=>I've got the opportunity to buy some clothes today.
MARSHALL=>Yes.
JOE=>Money's no object.
MARSHALL=>Good. Where you going?
JOE=>Well. I'm going out tonight in the city.
MARSHALL=>Nice places?
JOE=>I hope so. Then tomorrow I'm flying to L.A.
MARSHALL=>First class?
JOE=>Yeah.
MARSHALL=>Good.
JOE=>Then I'm getting on a yacht and sailing to the South Pacific.
JOE=>No. A really unknown little island.
MARSHALL=>No tourists?
JOE=>I don't think so.
MARSHALL=>Good.
JOE=>Then I'll be on the island for a couple of weeks, then that's it.
MARSHALL=>And what do you got in the way of clothes now?
JOE=>Well, I've got the kind of clothes I'm wearin'.
MARSHALL=>So you've got no clothes. We'll start with basics. We'll start with underwear. We'll start with Dunhill.
JOE=>So just socks and underwear?
MARSHALL=>Conservative underwear is the only way to go. White cotton broadcloth boxers. Silk shorts make you feel like a whore, so none of that. But with the tee shirts, Egyptian cotton, all right?
JOE=>Alright.
UNDERGARMENT SALESMAN=>How many pairs of boxer shorts would you like, sir?
JOE=>How many does a man need?
UNDERGARMENT=>SALESMAN Eight pairs.
MARSHALL=>What?
STATUE=>How about a dollar for the way I look?
MARSHALL=>Shoot. How 'bout a dollar for the way I look?
MARSHALL=>Yeah.
JOE=>They've got a changing room. I'm wearing the underwear.
MARSHALL=>I knew that. I could see it on your face.
MARSHALL=>What else you need?
JOE=>Ah, well, some kind of overcoat. I don't know, maybe like a English trench coat. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 6/7/89 34.
MARSHALL=>English trench coat? That's foul weather wear, man. You're goin' west!
JOE=>What would you get?
MARSHALL=>You're a sexual man?
JOE=>Yeah?
MARSHALL=>Not that I mean to be crude, but I'm trying to express something. Armani. That's what you want. And how 'bout a haircut?
JOE=>What's wrong with my hair?
MARSHALL=>I can't express it. It looks like freedom without choice. It looks wrong.
MARSHALL=>Salon Salon, please.
MARSHALL=>Hi, gimme Cassie Cimorelli, please. Hello, Cassie? It's Marshall, how you? Good. Listen, I got somebody who needs you today, can you help me out? 2:30? Great, good, thanks.
MARSHALL=>We gotta get moving.
JOE=>So what do I ask for?
MARSHALL=>This is too complicated. I gotta come in with you. If I getta ticket it can't be helped.
MARSHALL=>I still think the full break over the shoe is the way to go.
TAILOR=>No more than half this year, I swear to you. You can take it off now, sir.
MARSHALL=>Hey, Joe, how about a tux?
JOE=>What for?
MARSHALL=>Something'll come up. There's nothing a man looks better in.
JOE=>I'll get one if you get one.
MARSHALL=>I can't be buying no Armani tux. I'm a working man.
JOE=>You're getting paid to drive the car. Nobody's paying you to give me all this advice. Let me buy you the tux and we'll call it even. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 6/7/89 35A.
MARSHALL=>Gimme the full break over the shoe, Pietro. It's my preference.
TAILOR=>Whatever's your pleasure, sir.
MARSHALL=>Come on, kid! We're on a roll! Didn't even get a ticket.
CASSIE=>I'm undoing this cut from before. This is some piece of geography. Where'd you get this?
JOE=>In one of those subway barber shops.
CASSIE=>It has that reality. Grim. You're a very handsome guy, I'm just gonna bring that out. Marshall, which one is that?
MARSHALL=>It's the in and out issue.
CASSIE=>That's the best! What's in?
MARSHALL=>Carrie Fisher, Barcelona, African-Americans, happy endings, The New York Dally News, tomato salads, God, garlic, wristwatches you have to wind up, and true love.
CASSIE=>Did you say Carrie Fisher?
MARSHALL=>You don't like Carrie Fisher?
CASSIE=>I love Carrie Fisher! I can't believe it! So intelligent! So dry! That's a totally great list. What's out? Read it slow.
MARSHALL=>Kafka, C.D.'s.
CASSIE=>That's true. I've had it with Kafka. Those little eyes...so full of misery.
MARSHALL=>Stand-up comedy...
CASSIE=>Stand-up comedy makes me nervous.
MARSHALL=>All restaurants that haven't been in existence for at least thirty years.
CASSIE=>Yes.
MARSHALL=>Paloma Picasso.
CASSIE=>No, I don't agree with that. I love Paloma Picasso. Those lips! So red, so big!
MARSHALL=>New money and old money.
CASSIE=>Okay.
MARSHALL=>All camp, all trash, all trivia...
CASSIE=>Oh com'on, take a risk.
MARSHALL=>And The New York Times.
CASSIE=>Finally somebody said it! What rag!
CASSIE=>Very gratifying. Thank you, Marshall. Well, here you are.
JOE=>I look good.
MARSHALL=>You're coming into focus, kid! I can see you now.
JOE=>I'll take it.
SALESWOMAN=>Yes, sir.
JOE=>I'll take this, too.
HAMMACHER SCHLEMMER SALESMAN=>Will that be all?
SALESWOMAN=>Does that interest your
JOE=>You mean you can walk on water?
SALESWOMAN=>With a little help. Yes.
JOE=>I'll take a pair.
SALESWOMAN=>Alright. Very good, sir. Thank you.
JOE=>Thank YOU.
JOE=>Thanks!
MARSHALL=>You know what you need?
JOE=>What else could I need?
MARSHALL=>How you gonna carry this stuff? You need luggage!
JOE=>I didn't think of that.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>Have you thought much about luggage, Mr. Banks?
JOE=>No, I never really have.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>It's the central preoccupation of my life. You travel the world, you're away from home, perhaps away from your family, all you have to depend on is yourself and your luggage.
JOE=>I guess that's true.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>Are you traveling light or heavy?
JOE=>Heavy.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>Flying?
JOE=>Flying. And by ship.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>An ocean voyage?
JOE=>Yes.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>Ah. Yes. So. A real journey.
JOE=>And then I'll be staying on this island, I don't even really know if I'll be living in a hut or what.
LUGGAGE=>SALESMAN Very exciting.
JOE=>Yeah.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>As a luggage problem. I believe I have just the thing.
JOE=>Wow.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>This is our premier steamer trunk. All handmade, only the finest materials. It's even water-tight, tight as a drum. If I had the need and the wherewithal, Mr. Banks, this would be my trunk of choice. I could face the world with a trunk like this by my side.
JOE=>I'll take four of them.
LUGGAGE SALESMAN=>May you live to be a thousand years old, sir.
JOE=>I'm through shopping.
MARSHALL=>Fair enough. Where to? Back to Staten Island?
JOE=>Yeah, I guess so. No. A really good hotel. The Plaza?
MARSHALL=>The Plaza's nice.
JOE=>Where would you go?
MARSHALL=>The Pierre!
JOE=>Marshall?
MARSHALL=>Yeah?
JOE=>I wonder if you'd want to have dinner with me tonight?
MARSHALL=>Can't do it. I got my wife and kids at the end of the day, you know?
JOE=>Yeah.
HEAD BELLMAN=>Everything's at check-in when you're ready, sir.
MARSHALL=>Listen, ain't you got nobody?
JOE=>No. But there are certain times in your life when I guess you're not supposed to have anybody, you know? There are certain doors you have to go through alone.
MARSHALL=>You're gonna be Alright.
STEWARDESS=>Can I get you anything, sir?
JOE=>No, thank you. No, I changed my mind. Some club soda, please.
STEWARDESS=>Alright.
FATHER CONROY=>I think I'll have one more.
STEWARDESS=>Alright.
JOE=>Have you ever been to California before?
FATHER CONROY=>Oh, many times.
JOE=>I've never been anywhere.
FATHER CONROY=>I was a chaplain there, years ago. For the Marines. Camp Pendleton.
JOE=>I don't believe in God
FATHER CONROY=>Okay.
JOE=>I did when I was a kid, but I lost my faith in high school.
FATHER CONROY=>Uh-huh.
JOE=>And then, when I was in danger - I was a fireman - in the middle of the fire, I never like turned around and fell to my knees and started praying.
FATHER CONROY=>No?
JOE=>No. There are atheists in foxholes.
FATHER CONVOY=>I'm sure there are.
JOE=>But I've come to a place in my life where I've come face to face with the facts of life and death. I mean, it's a chance happening I'm alive, it's a miracle, I'm so lucky! And it's not going to last. It's like a shooting star. So beautiful, so fleeting, make a wish before it's gone, you know? I'm so moved. But cut off. If there is a God, if there is some kind of music going through everything, I can't hear it. I'm alone. I really feel I'm alone. I'm walking down this little path by myself.
FATHER CONROY=>Yes.
JOE=>Can you help me?
STEWARDESS=>Hi. I have your drinks.
JOE=>Oh, yeah. Thank you.
FATHER CONROY=>Thank you.
JOE=>Can you help me?
FATHER CONROY=>Do you see an analyst of some kind?
JOE=>I don't need an analyst. That's not the kind of problem I have.
FATHER CONROY=>If you need a guide. If you're a seeker and you need a guide, someone to counsel you so you can find your way forward into a spiritual realm. And you're on an airplane. Don't look in first class.
JOE=>Hi.
ANGELICA=>Hi, are you Joe Banks?
JOE=>Yeah. Who are you?
ANGELICA=>I'm the daughter of the guy who hired you. Angelica Graynamore.
JOE=>Nice to meet you. Again.
ANGELICA=>What?
ANGELICA=>Daddy told me to tell you that I don't know what he hired you for, and not to tell me. That I'm totally untrustworthy. I'm a flibberti-gibbet. C'mon, let's get outta here.
JOE=>I've got some luggage.
JOE=>I've never been to L.A. before.
ANGELICA=>What do you think?
JOE=>It looks fake. I like it.
ANGELICA=>Daddy wanted to put you up in Bel Air, but I said no way! Shangri-la, Shangri-la!
ANGELICA=>Thanks. That's for you. And put everything on the curb, please.
DRIVER=>Thank you.
ANGELICA=>Check in, fresh up, I'll be back for you at seven. We'll have dinner.
RITA=>Black bread with sour cream and golden caviar.
RALPH=>The Dungeness crabs.
ANGELICA=>What's the matter?
JOE=>Nothing.
ANGELICA=>They do look like little monsters or something. But they're good little monsters.
ANGELICA=>What'd you do before you signed on with Daddy?
JOE=>I was an advertising librarian for a medical supply company.
ANGELICA=>Oh. I have no response to that.
JOE=>What do you do?
ANGELICA=>Why do you ask?
JOE=>Uh, I don't know.
ANGELICA=>I'm a painter. And a poet.
JOE=>Really?
ANGELICA=>Yes. Does that bother you?
JOE=>No.
ANGELICA=>People from New York usually look down on painters. And poets.
JOE=>I didn't know that.
ANGELICA=>They think if you live in L.A., and you say you're an artist, you really do nothing!
JOE=>Why?
ANGELICA=>You don't think I do nothing? JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 5/16/89 48A.
JOE=>No.
ANGELICA=>You believe me when I say I'm a painter?
JOE=>And a poet. Sure.
ANGELICA=>Well, you're right. There's a painting of mine right there. CUT TO: 60A PAINTING OF CAR 60A
JOE=>It's terrific. Where you get your ideas?
ANGELICA=>I'll show you.
JOE=>Nice view. It's like looking down at the stars.
ANGELICA=>Do you want to hear one of my poems?
JOE=>Sure.
ANGELICA=>Long ago, the delicate tangles of his hair, Covered the emptiness of my hands. Do you wanna hear it again?
JOE=>Okay.
ANGELICA=>Long ago, the delicate tangles of his hair, Covered the emptiness of my hands. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 5/16/89 50.
JOE=>What's the matter?
ANGELICA=>Did you ever think about killing yourself?
JOE=>What? Why would you do that?
ANGELICA=>Why shouldn't I?
JOE=>Some things take care of themselves. They're not your job. Maybe they're not even your business. I like your poem.
ANGELICA=>I'm a grown woman and I live on my father's money. That restaurant that had my painting up, that's my father's restaurant.
JOE=>Why are you telling me?
ANGELICA=>I don't know. I'll tell anybody who'll listen. No, that's not true. I don't know why I'm telling you.
JOE=>Listen to me. If you have a choice between killing yourself and doing something you're scared of doing, why not take the leap and do the thing you're scared of doing?
ANGELICA=>You mean stop taking money and leave L.A.?
JOE=>You see? You know what you're afraid of doing. Why don't you do it? See what happens?
ANGELICA=>You must be tired.
ANGELICA=>Thanks for listening, but I'm a little high, and you don't know me from Adam, I mean, I guess, Eve. Anyway, forget it.
JOE=>I don't mind talking.
ANGELICA=>Well, I do! This is one of those typical conversations where we're all open and sharing our innermost thoughts and it's all bullshit and a lie and it doesn't cost you anything!
JOE=>Look. I don't know you. I don't think I know anybody. You're angry. I can see that. I'm very troubled. I'm not ready to... There's only so much time and you wanna use it well. So I'm here talking to you, I don't wanna throw that away. You seem...
ANGELICA=>I seem what?
JOE=>You seem far away.
ANGELICA=>I have no response to that.
JOE=>Maybe you better take me back to the hotel.
ANGELICA=>You want me to come in? I could come up with you?
JOE=>No.
ANGELICA=>Alright. Will you have breakfast with me? I'm supposed to get you to the boat by ten, but I could meet you for breakfast.
JOE=>Okay.
ANGELICA=>I told you I was a flibbertigibbet.
ANGELICA=>I'm so tired. You take that stuff, it just ruins your sleep. I'm sorry I was so abusive, immature, hostile, and needy last night.
JOE=>You were fine.
ANGELICA=>I disappointed you. So, what did Daddy hire you to do?
JOE=>It's real complicated.
ANGELICA=>Okay. I don't even know where you're going on the boat. Patricia won't tell me.
JOE=>Who's Patricia?
ANGELICA=>She's my half-sister. She's the one who's sailing you wherever you're going.
JOE=>She is?
ANGELICA=>You didn't know?
JOE=>No.
ANGELICA=>Daddy loves a secret almost as much as he loves money. Can I ask you something?
JOE=>What?
ANGELICA=>Why are you dressed like Jungle Jim?
JOE=>You think this is inappropriate? For the boat?
ANGELICA=>No, it's fine. We'd better get going. I gotta guy dropping your trunks off at the marina who may not have understood my travel directions.
ANGELICA=>Here we are.
JOE=>Is that it?
ANGELICA=>Yeah.
JOE=>It's big.
JOE=>You say this is your half- sister?
ANGELICA=>Yeah.
PATRICIA=>What's the trunks, Felix?
JOE=>They're my... My name's not Felix, it's Joe.
PATRICIA=>I know. Mike! Tony! Find a place for these boxes.
PATRICIA=>That outfit's wearing you, Felix.
JOE=>Why are you calling me Felix? My name's Joe.
PATRICIA=>I'm calling you Felix because I do what I want. Hello, Angelica.
ANGELICA=>Hello, Patricia.
ANGELICA=>Well, you're in a rotten mood.
PATRICIA=>It's the sunshine. It gets me down.
ANGELICA=>Where are you going?
PATRICIA=>Can you believe it? Dad said not to tell you. Goes with my theory. Power makes you paranoid.
MIKE=>All set.
PATRICIA=>Well, get ready to heave, Felix.
JOE=>My name is Joseph or Joe.
PATRICIA=>Alright. Joe. Get ready. We're leaving.
JOE=>'Bye.
ANGELICA=>'Bye.
JOE=>Listen. Don't take drugs.
ANGELICA=>Okay.
JOE=>Wish me luck.
ANGELICA=>Good luck.
ANGELICA=>You're shaking.
JOE=>Am I? A little. Yeah.
DAGMAR=>Have you put out the sunflowers, yet?
TONY=>Yeah.
DAGMAR=>Good! Go.
JOE=>Looks delicious.
PATRICIA=>We eat well aboard The Tweedle Dee.
JOE=>The Tweedle Dee?
PATRICIA=>That's the name of this boat.
JOE=>Oh.
PATRICIA=>So we're going to the island of Waponi Woo.
JOE=>I guess so.
PATRICIA=>Why?
JOE=>You don't know?
PATRICIA=>No.
JOE=>Have you ever been there?
PATRICIA=>No. All I know about Waponi Woo is that the name means 'the little island with the big volcano,' and that the people, the Waponis, like orange soda.
JOE=>They like orange soda.
PATRICIA=>Yeah. But here! I've got a book. 'Eighteen hundred years ago, a Roman galley with a crew of Jews and Druids, got caught in a huge storm off Carthage. They were swept a thousand miles off course, and ended up on the wrong side of the horn of Africa. Thinking
JOE=>Why'd you talk to me so snotty back on the dock?
PATRICIA=>Because you work for my father. And I'm angry with my father. But he's not around to give him a shot. So you work for him, I give you a shot.
JOE=>Why you angry with him?
PATRICIA=>Because he's never around.
JOE=>If you're angry with him, and he's never around, why are you working for him?
PATRICIA=>I don't work for him. My transport of you is strictly a favor.
JOE=>You do favors for people you're mad at?
PATRICIA=>I don't work for him!
JOE=>Alright.
PATRICIA=>He said he'd give me this boat if I took you.
JOE=>Wow.
PATRICIA=>He's got two of them. This is The Tweedle Dee. There's a Tweedle Dum, too.
PATRICIA=>I've got the wheel tied up, which is not good sailing. Excuse me.
PATRICIA=>Is this okay for you?
JOE=>Sure.
PATRICIA=>The boys like to sleep in the hull. Dagmar sleeps on deck when the weather's good. So you've pretty much got things to yourself. I'm in the little stateroom.
JOE=>Great.
PATRICIA=>I'm sorry I was so rude on the dock.
JOE=>That's okay.
PATRICIA=>Did you sleep with my sister?
JOE=>No.
PATRICIA=>Actually, she's my half- sister.
JOE=>No, I didn't.
PATRICIA=>Okay. Do you like to fish?
JOE=>Sure.
PATRICIA=>Maybe tomorrow we'll do some fishing.
PATRICIA=>This is the light switch. Did Mike show you how to work the bathroom?
JOE=>Yeah.
PATRICIA=>Good. Do you want me to turn off the light while I'm going?
JOE=>Okay.
PATRICIA=>I love my sister. I know she's screwed up. I love my father, even though I never see him and he's not so great when I do see him. I'm very nervous about this trip. My father didn't tell me anything and you don't seem to be telling me anything. But it's more than that. I've always kept clear of my father's stuff since I got out on my own. Now he's pulled me back in. He knew I wanted this boat and he used it and he got me working for him, which I swore I would never do. I feel ashamed because I had a price. He named it. And now I know that about myself. I don't know who you are. I don't know anything about you. But you're working for him, too, and that makes us two of a kind. I could treat you like I did back on the dock, but that would be me kicking myself for selling out. Which isn't fair to you and doesn't make me feel any better. I don't know what your situation is. But I wanted you to know what mine is. Not just to explain some rude behavior. But because we're on a little boat for a while and I'm soul sick and you're gonna see that. Like my sister. She's soul sick, too. And if you'd slept with her I would've known something about you. But you didn't. You didn't. I believe you.
JOE=>I'm glad you believe me.
PATRICIA=>Have you ever slept on a boat before?
JOE=>No.
PATRICIA=>It really affects your dreams. I look forward to it. Even though, sometimes, the dreams really shake me up. Okay. Good night.
JOE=>Good night.
PATRICIA=>Do you like cognac?
JOE=>Cognac?
PATRICIA=>Yeah.
JOE=>I guess so.
PATRICIA=>I make a point of not knowing about certain things. One of them's cognac. I like cognac. But I don't want the accepted wisdom about cognac, you know what I mean? I mean I want glimpses of the myth about it. You see people drink it out of these big glasses, and smelling it forever. That's interesting to me, that sight of them doing that. But I don't want them to talk to me about it, you know what I mean? I want to figure it out based on what I've seen from other people, and what I personally get from it.
PATRICIA=>So this is what I've got. So far. To say about this: Most cognac is French. It's very volatile. Like gasoline or model airplane glue. And when you taste it, in my opinion, it tastes like gasoline or model airplane glue. That's because it's for smelling really. And I figure that's because the French, physically, tend to have big noses. They get the pleasure of the cognac through the nose. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 5/16/89 67.
PATRICIA=>You could really just smell it and pour it down the sink. But this isn't French cognac. This is Italian cognac. It's probably generally considered inferior. But the news is, it tastes good. Maybe it doesn't smell as good -- it smells okay - but it tastes good. And when I came to that fork in the road, between the nose and the tongue, I chose the tongue. So, here's to the tongue. They toast.
JOE=>To the tongue. They drink a little.
JOE=>It's good. Don't the Italians have big noses, too?
PATRICIA=>Yeah. And that really messes up my theory.
PATRICIA=>So my understanding, as far as I understand it, is I'm leaving you on this island.
JOE=>That's right.
PATRICIA=>How long are you going to stay there?
JOE=>For the rest of my life.
PATRICIA=>Really.
JOE=>Yeah.
PATRICIA=>I can't imagine that.
JOE=>I couldn't have imagined any of this.
JOE=>Are you used to this?
PATRICIA=>What?
JOE=>The ocean, the stars.
PATRICIA=>You never get used to it. Why do you think I want this boat? All I want to do is sail away.
JOE=>Where would you go
PATRICIA=>Away from the things of man.
JOE=>Do you believe in God?
PATRICIA=>I believe in myself.
JOE=>What's that mean?
PATRICIA=>I have confidence in myself.
JOE=>I've done a lot of soul searching lately. I've been asking myself some tough questions. You know what I've found out?
PATRICIA=>What?
JOE=>I have no interest in myself. I think about myself, I get bored out of my mind.
PATRICIA=>What does interest you?
JOE=>I don't know. Courage. Courage interests me.
PATRICIA=>You're going to spend the rest of your life on a tiny island in the South Pacific?
JOE=>Well, up till now I've lived on a tiny island called Staten Island, and I've commuted to a job in a shut up room with pumped in air, no sunshine, despicable people, and now that I've got some distance from that situation, that seems pretty unbelievable. Your life seems unbelievable to me. All this like life, seems unbelievable to me. Somewhat. At this moment.
PATRICIA=>My father says almost the whole world's asleep. Everybody you know, everybody you see, everybody you talk to. He says only a few people are awake. And they live in a state of constant total amazement.
JOE=>I have less than six months to live. The Waponis believe they need a human sacrifice or their island's going to sink into the ocean. They have a mineral your father wants. He's hired me to jump in their volcano.
PATRICIA=>What?
JOE=>You're not going to make me say that again, are you?
PATRICIA=>No.
JOE=>Aren't you going to say anything?
PATRICIA=>I don't know what to say. You tell me you're dying, you tell me you're jumping into a volcano, my mind is a blank.
JOE=>I can understand that
PATRICIA=>Is this disease catching?
JOE=>No.
PATRICIA=>Good night. I'll see you in the morning.
JOE=>So I fell asleep and I had this dream. I dreamed I was a cowboy in the wilderness. I dreamed I was a cowboy and I saved this girl...
JOE=>Little weird today, huh?
DAGMAR=>There's a typhoon warning. Good morning, Mister Banks.
JOE=>Good morning.
DAGMAR=>Looks like we're in for a blow.
JOE=>Can I help?
PATRICIA=>Yeah. You could tie that up. It feels dead, doesn't it?
JOE=>Yes. It does.
PATRICIA=>Mike, get below! Start the engine. Tell Tony to head us into the wind and keep us into the wind!
MIKE=>Okay.
JOE=>There isn't any wind.
PATRICIA=>There will be.
JOE=>Are you worried?
PATRICIA=>I think we'll be Alright. The hatches are down, the sails are down, we're ahead of the game.
JOE=>What exactly is a typhoon?
PATRICIA=>You know, Joe, I think you're going to find out.
PATRICIA=>Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, latitude 10 degrees, 8 minutes south, longitude approximately 150 degrees, 18 minutes west. We are in severe distress. Mayday, Mayday, latitude 10 degrees, 8 minutes south, longitude approximately 150 degrees, 18 minutes west.
JOE=>What should I do?
PATRICIA=>Don't go on deck! Check on Dagmar. She went forward to look at the engine.
JOE=>Everything okay?
DAGMAR=>Looks good, but I'm going to stay with it.
JOE=>Okay.
PATRICIA=>Mayday, Mayday! Latitude 10 degrees, 8 minutes south, longitude approximately 150 degrees, 18 minutes west. Severe distress! Severe distress!
PATRICIA=>No way is anybody getting this. How's Dagmar?
JOE=>She's fine.
PATRICIA=>Good.
MIKE=>The main boom doesn't look secure!
PATRICIA=>What?
MIKE=>I think it's gonna bust loose.
JOE=>What are you doing?
PATRICIA=>It's my boat.
JOE=>Patricia? Patricia?
JOE=>Ee he o he-o cowboy Ee he o he-o oooo Ee he o he-o cowboy, cowboy, cowboy Under the moon
JOE=>Ee he o he-o cowboy Ee he o he-o oooo Ee he o he-o cowboy, cowboy, cowboy Under the moon

SIZZLING.=>JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 4/14/89 83.
JOE=>Hello. My name is Joe.
JOE=>I'm dying. Ahead of schedule.
JOE=>Dear God, whose name I do not know, thank you for my life. I forgot how big... Thank you for my life
PATRICIA=>Joe? Joe? Didn't you drink any water for yourself? Joe?
JOE=>That's for you.
PATRICIA=>How long have I been unconscious?
JOE=>I don't know. Days. You woke up.
PATRICIA=>I guess I did.
JOE=>Good.
PATRICIA=>Finish this.
JOE=>No. You need it.
PATRICIA=>I feel pretty good. You look like shit.
JOE=>It's good to hear you talking.
PATRICIA=>C'mon, drink it. Don't you wanna be in good shape for the Waponis?
JOE=>I'll never make it.
PATRICIA=>What are you talking about? Look.
PATRICIA=>It's a miracle. We must've lucked into the right tidal current.
PATRICIA=>What happened to the yacht?
JOE=>Struck by lightning.
JOE=>Everything went under.
PATRICIA=>Except your trunks.
JOE=>Except my trunks.
JOE=>So that's Waponi Woo.
EMO=>Ah bey!
VOICES=>Ho!
EMO=>Ah bey!
VOICES=>Ho!
EMO=>Kimo Sabby Sah!
VOICES=>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
JOE=>What's that?
PATRICIA=>I think we've been spotted.
BAW=>Whooa! Are you Joe?
JOE=>Yeah.
WELCOMING GROUP=>Whooa!
BAW=>Are you Joe Banks?
JOE=>Yeah.
BAW=>Pelica beeble bum bum!
PATRICIA=>I guess they're glad to see us.
JOE=>What is that? A teddy bear?
CHIEF=>No. It is my soul.
JOE=>I hope you don't lose it.
CHIEF=>So do I. I am Tobi. Chief.
JOE=>This is Patricia Graynamore. I'm Joe Banks. You speak English.
CHIEF=>I have learned. You have come to stop the anger of the Woo?
JOE=>Yes.
CHIEF=>There was worry that you would not come. You were to come before this.
JOE=>Well. I'm here now.
CHIEF=>You're with him?
PATRICIA=>Yes.
CHIEF=>Tonight, we will have a big feast. And then, at the end of the feast, we will climb to the top of the Big Woo, and you will jump in. Okay?
JOE=>Okay.
CHIEF=>The women will take this woman and make her clean for the feast. Pelica! Pelica!
PATRICIA=>Joe!
JOE=>Patricia! Is she gonna be Alright?
CHIEF=>And the men will take you and make you right for the feast. Oliva! Oliva!
JOE=>Hey, stop that!
PATRICIA=>Where's my friend?
PATRICIA=>Where's Joe Banks?
PATRICIA=>Is my friend here?
BAW=>Oliva!

CHIEF=>You look good, now.
PATRICIA=>Thank you.
CHIEF=>Joe Banks said your name is Graynamore.
PATRICIA=>Yes, it is.
CHIEF=>I've had talks with Samuel Harvey Graynamore.
PATRICIA=>He's my father.
CHIEF=>Your father is like the Big Woo. He must be fed or he will destroy the world.
PATRICIA=>Do you know where my friend, Joe Banks, is?
CHIEF=>Maybe he ran away? Maybe he don't want to jump in the Big Woo. Maybe he's swimming to someplace else. Maybe he swam to that no good island over there.
CHIEF=>Oliva! Oliva! Bum bum bum.
NATIVES=>Wo-o-o-o-o.
CHIEF=>The Woo wants his flesh!
CHIEF=>So. You didn't run away.
JOE=>No. I made a deal and I'll stick by it.
JOE=>How do you like my tux? JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 8/25/89 95A.
PATRICIA=>Pretty great.
JOE=>I thought I might as well go out in style.
PATRICIA=>You're really going to do it?
JOE=>Yeah.
PATRICIA=>What's wrong with that man?
CHIEF=>His teeth have holes in them from drinking orange soda. Jump.
JOE=>What did he want you to do about it?
CHIEF=>There are those who want a man who will fix the holes.
PATRICIA=>A dentist
CHIEF=>Yes.
CHIEF=>Joe Banks. We are the children of children and we live as we are shown. Now a change has come. The Waponis like this soda, and no one among my people will jump into the Big Woo. They trade with this man, your father, for a hero. We have no hero-of our own. So we give this man the right to dig holes in the ground under us like the Jump digs holes in our teeth and in some short time we will be nothing but holes. I am the Tobi. I cannot be the hero. It is my place to hope for my people. But the Woo calls and no one from among my people says, I will go to my end for the rest of you. Joe Banks. We are not your people. Let us die. Take a boat and your woman and go to that no good island over there. Don't jump in the Big Woo.
JOE=>I have no people of my own, Chief. I'm my only hope for a hero.
CHIEF=>Once more I'll call among the Waponis for a hero.
CHIEF=>Who knew woe sue-weigh? Who knew woe? Drama said, said sue-weigh? I na box, bum, pelica. Box.
CHIEF=>They are all afraid to die. There is no hero among them. They deserve to die.
JOE=>Take me to the volcano.
PATRICIA=>Joe! Joe!
PATRICIA=>Joe! Joe! Don't do it! Don't do it!
JOE=>Is there any ceremony or anything?
CHIEF=>No. You just jump in.
PATRICIA=>Don't do it! Please don't do it, Joe! I love you! I've fallen in love with you! I've never loved anybody! I don't know how it happened! And I've never even slept with you or anything and now you're going to kill yourself!
JOE=>You love me?
PATRICIA=>Yes, I love you! I can feel my heart! I feel like I'm going crazy! You can't die and leave me here on this stinking earth without you!
JOE=>I've got to do it.
PATRICIA=>Why? The Chief doesn't even want you to do it.
JOE=>'Cause I've wasted my whole life. And now I'm going to die. I've got a chance to die like a man and I'm going to take it! I've got to take it!
PATRICIA=>I love you!
JOE=>I love you, too. I've never loved anybody, either. It's great. I'm glad. But the timing stinks.
PATRICIA=>Joe!
JOE=>Get out of here! Go back down!
PATRICIA=>No.
JOE=>Please let me do what I've got to do!
PATRICIA=>Marry me!
JOE=>What!
PATRICIA=>Marry me!
PATRICIA=>Chief! Chief! Could you come up here, please?
JOE=>What the hell are you doing?
PATRICIA=>I want him to marry us.
JOE=>I'm jumping into a volcano!
PATRICIA=>So marry me and then jump into the volcano.
CHIEF=>What?
PATRICIA=>Could you marry us?
CHIEF=>Okay.
JOE=>I don't want to get married!
PATRICIA=>What's the problem? You afraid of the commitment? You'll have to love me and honor me for about thirty seconds! You can't handle that?
JOE=>Alright. Marry us.
PATRICIA=>Thank you!
JOE=>You're welcome!
CHIEF=>Do you want to marry her?
JOE=>Yes!
CHIEF=>Do you want to marry him?
PATRICIA=>Yes!
CHIEF=>You're married.
PATRICIA=>Thank you, Chief.
CHIEF=>I'm going now.
PATRICIA=>Don't jump in.
JOE=>I want you to listen Patricia, because these are my last words. I gotta be brave. I gotta jump in.
PATRICIA=>I'm jumping in with you.
JOE=>Oh no you're not'
PATRICIA=>Whither thou goest!
JOE=>I'll knock you out! I'll throw you down!
PATRICIA=>And take away my freedom of choice?
JOE=>Why do you love me?
PATRICIA=>On the raft. You gave me the water. No one's ever put my life ahead of theirs. So I love YOU and I'm jumping into this volcano with you!
JOE=>Did I ever tell you that the first time I saw you, I felt like I'd seen you before?
JOE=>This is it!
CHIEF=>So. You did not want them. I won't go to that no good island! For me, this is the end.
JOE=>What happened?
PATRICIA=>It just spit us back out again. Joe, we're rejects!
JOE=>Well, I did it. I did it. I did my job. I jumped into the volcano. We jumped into the volcano.
PATRICIA=>Look!
JOE=>So the Waponis were right.
PATRICIA=>What do you mean?
JOE=>They said if there wasn't a sacrifice, their island would sink. And it did.
PATRICIA=>Oh my God, look! Look!
JOE=>A boat!
PATRICIA=>It's The Tweedle Dum! Ahoy! Ahoy! Come on!
PATRICIA=>It's my crew! They're alive!
DAGMAR=>We were saved.
PATRICIA=>That's wonderful! That's amazing!
DAGMAR=>We were very lucky.
GRAYNAMORE=>There goes my dream of beating the shit out of the competition.
PATRICIA=>Daddy?
GRAYNAMORE=>You kept your bargain, Mr. Banks. To the letter. The miracle of course is that you kept the bargain and you're alive.
JOE=>So what? My number's about up one way or the other.
GRAYNAMORE=>Yes.
PATRICIA=>Daddy?
GRAYNAMORE=>I thought you were dead, young lady. I thought you drowned. Both of you for that matter. I just got here to see what kind of alternate deal I could cut with the Chief. But the Chief, I'm afraid, is history.
PATRICIA=>You don't show any sign of being glad I'm alive.
GRAYNAMORE=>Oh, I'm glad. I'm just disappointed about losing these mineral rights. It meant a lot to me. It was a real opportunity.
PATRICIA=>You are so... full of holes.
GRAYNAMORE=>This is a small boat, Mr. Banks. Too small to keep a big secret all the way back to L.A. Come out, Kenneth!
JOE=>Dr. Ellison.
KENNETH=>Or words to that effect.
GRAYNAMORE=>His name is Kenneth Hindmick. Business Affairs. He works for me.
KENNETH=>Hi. Need your taxes done?
JOE=>Kenneth Hindmick.
KENNETH=>Need any terrible job done? I'm your man.
JOE=>Not Dr. Ellison.
KENNETH=>Kenneth Hindmick. I'm not a bad guy, really. I just have an unfortunate tendency to do what I'm told.
PATRICIA=>Joe?
JOE=>His name is Kenneth Hindmick.
GRAYNAMORE=>And he made believe he was a Dr. Ellison. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 6/2/89 108.
GRAYNAMORE=>And he told Joe here that he had something called a brain cloud, and that he was going to die. So that Joe here would agree to jump in the volcano.
PATRICIA=>Oh! That's dastardly. You're both dastards.
JOE=>I don't have a brain cloud?
KENNETH=>No, you don't have anything. You're just a hypochondriac. Sorry. Or, looking on the bright side, congratulations!
JOE=>You know, I'm gonna beat you up!
KENNETH=>Hold it! Don't make me kill you when there's nothing wrong with you! I feel bad enough already. I told you he'd be mad.
GRAYNAMORE=>So we'll just take turns watching him till we get back to L.A. Nobody'll believe his story anyway.
PATRICIA=>I will. I'll back him up.
GRAYNAMORE=>Now, Patricia, when we get back, I'm going to give this boat to you, and you can sail off into the distance with it and be done with us all.
PATRICIA=>No deal.
CONTINUED: GRAYNAMORE=>So we'll take turns watching the two of them till we get back to L.A., and then we'll turn them both loose, and I'll keep the boat.
PATRICIA=>That's fine with me.
JOE=>You've forgotten one thing.
GRAYNAMORE=>Oh, I have? Nothing comes readily to mind.
JOE=>I've looked into the volcano, Mr. Graynamore. You know what I mean? After that, the hole in the front of a gun doesn't scare me at all.
KENNETH=>Stay back.
JOE=>I'm gonna take the gun away from you, Kenneth.
KENNETH=>Do you think I won't shoot?
JOE=>I don't know. That's your part. I can't make you shoot me and I can't stop you. I can only do my part. I'm going to take the gun away from you.
KENNETH=>Just as well.
GRAYNAMORE=>If I'd had the gun, you'd be dead now.
JOE=>We'll never know. Patricia, tell Dad the happy news.
PATRICIA=>We got married. The Chief married us.
JOE=>And I was wondering where you thought we should go on, you know, a honeymoon?
GRAYNAMORE=>I have no idea
JOE=>I thought we might like to go on a sailing trip. How's that sound?
PATRICIA=>I think that sounds great!
JOE=>Does this thing have like a rubber raft or something?
PATRICIA=>It has a dinghy.
JOE=>Let's break it out. I think your father's tired of this ostentatious life style.
KENNETH=>What if there's a storm?
JOE=>Then you'll drown.
GRAYNAMORE=>You'll pay for this. I'll see to that!
JOE=>You know what I think, Mr. Graynamore?
GRAYNAMORE=>What?
JOE=>I think that you don't scare me at all. Maybe you can do some stuff to me - if you make it back home. If I come back. And maybe you can't. It remains to be seen. But what I think, and I say this to you from the bottom of my heart, sir. I don't fear you at all. I don't fear any man. Because every day is a gift, and I'm just glad as hell it looks like I may have a few. And beyond that, to be scared or glad of anything beyond that, why a man's just got to be a fool!
GRAYNAMORE=>I like that boy! Good for her!
KENNETH=>Good for her? What about us?
GRAYNAMORE=>I like a tight spot. Maybe I have gotten a little greedy. Start paddling while I re- assess my values. Start paddling.
KENNETH=>You paddle.
GRAYNAMORE=>Alright. Fair enough. We'll both paddle. 'And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by!' Com'on, let's put our backs into it. You know, I have a good feeling about this. Maybe we're going to become friends.
KENNETH=>I doubt that. You're just too overbearing.
PATRICIA=>So what's the end of Waponi Woo.
JOE=>Yeah, and the Chief.
PATRICIA=>Where are we going?
JOE=>Away from the things of man! I gotta get away from the things of man for a while.
PATRICIA=>Look!
JOE=>I'll tell you one thing. Wherever we're goin'. We're taking this luggage. Help me fish it out.
JOE=>Chief!
CHIEF=>Look! Look, Joe Banks, I still have my soul!
JOE=>Me, too. Me, too.
