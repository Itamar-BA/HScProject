WOMAN=>And in that one time... you’ll get the same answer.
BLACKOUT=>CREDITS BEGIN
GILLY=>Welcome to your twenties.
NATHAN=>Yeah, I guess. KEVIN
NATHAN=>Like, I trust you’ll tell mom I wasn’t drinking?
NATHAN=>What’s going on? GILLY
GIRLFRIENDS.=>The whole CLASS parts like the Red Sea when Nathan approaches Karen. Everyone turns silent as he looks straight at Karen, dead in the eyes.
MOMENT LATER=>Nathan looks out the window at Karen returning to her house.
KAREN=>Oh, it’s definitely not you. This kid’s too cute.
MARA=>No ‘hello mom’?
KEVIN=>It’s all yours.
NATHAN THOMAS HARPER=>July 25th, 1991 Certified by Vassar Brothers Hospital Nathan examines both sides of the paper, not really knowing what a fake one would look like.
NATHAN=>I think I’ve seen him. Maybe, it was him. I’m not sure-
GILLY=>Here’s you at two years old, at three-ish, and at five...
DIALS.=>After a moment, the MAN answers. OLDER VOICE
BACK OF HOUSE:=>Nathan and Karen run out of the house, and dive into his in- ground swimming pool. The house EXPLODES. It BLOWS APART into a million pieces. Glass everywhere. Wood spraying. It all goes up in an instantaneous BLAZE.
FRONT OF HOUSE:=>Policeman 1 gets INCINERATED, as Policeman 2 manages to escape out the front door and dives onto the yard.
BACK OF HOUSE:=>Nathan and Karen stay under water, as a blanket of fire drapes the pool for a few seconds. They hold hands under water, while the fire slowly dissipates.
WESLEY=>We got an explosion on Casper Creek road. Two officers down.
NATHAN=>Protect me? How come I’ve never seen you before?
JACK=>Not a problem.
DREAM SEQUENCE: BLACKNESS=>An echo-y rendition of ‘Que Sera Sera’ PLAYS, way off in the distance. The Shadowed Woman appears out of the dark. Her face is just barely in the darkness, while her she holds up young Nathan and SPINS him around. It’s a joyous, surreal moment, as LAUGHING can be heard. His laughing -- the laughing of a small child. When her face comes into the light... she’s a skeleton.
MOMENTS LATER=>Nathan reaches the CASHIER, 20, stoner-dude. He hands the Cashier a soaked twenty dollar bill.
GILLY=>Check my wallet.
NATHAN=>What’s all this? GILLY
GILLY=>You need a gun?
TICKET COUNTER=>Nathan reaches the TICKET TELLER, 40’s, female, glasses.
SLEEPING CAR HALLWAY=>They reach Room 42 -- open their door.
TRAIN HALLWAY=>The Stranger BUMPS into a CAR ATTENDANT.
DINING CAR=>Karen is on line at the buffet. She LOPS on potatoes and green beans and chicken -- enough to feed an army. The Stranger gets on line next to her -- smiles at her.
SLEEPING CAR HALLWAY=>Karen walks down the hallway, balancing the food with her hands. Without Karen noticing, the Stranger comes up behind her. Another PASSENGER walks by, passing both of them. When the Passenger is gone, the Stranger puts his hand over Karen’s mouth. The food FALLS to the ground -- plate SHATTERS. The Stranger PUNCHES Karen twice in the face, knocking her out. He quickly keys into his room, and HAULS her inside. He comes back out to clean up the mess, when a STEWARD happens to walk by.
STRANGER=>Thank you so much.
STEWARD=>I’ll get you a new food ticket in a few minutes, okay?
STRANGER=>Is there a secret knock, or password, I should know about before entering the room?
STRANGER=>Is there a secret knock, or password, I should know about before entering the room?
SLEEPING CAR HALLWAY=>The Stranger enters the hallway, as another FEMALE PASSENGER walks by. The Stranger smiles kindly at the Passenger, but as soon as she disappears around the corner, his smile disappears, as well. He approaches Room 42 -- KNOCKS twice, before KEYING into the room.
DINING CAR=>Nathan is scanning the dining car, wondering where Karen could be. He doesn’t see her, and heads back towards his room.
UKRAINIAN.=>Nathan flops him on to the ledge of the window -- pushing him off the train. He watches the Stranger land on the parallel tracks, SNAPPING his neck. But he also sees a YOUNG BOY, in the next car, leaning out the window, witnessing the whole thing. The boy looks directly at Nathan -- oops.
SLEEPING CAR HALLWAY=>Nathan exits his room, with his backpack and Karen’s things. On his way down the hallway, the train comes to a SCREECHING
HALT.=>Nathan falls backwards, along with a couple other PASSENGERS, but quickly gets up and runs down the hallway.
IN BETWEEN CARS=>Nathan pulls the ‘emergency’ latch on the exit door, and gets off the train, holding Karen as a crutch. The ALARM RINGS.
JACK=>Love the quilt.
NATHAN=>Hundred dollars.
OUTSIDE=>As soon as Karen lands on the ground outside, a car PULLS up out of nowhere and blocks her in the alley.
NATHAN=>I wouldn’t know a fake one from a real one, anyway.
BOYER=>Look around you, Nathan. Take a long, good look.
FLASH:=>The woman in Nathan’s dreams comes out of the shadows... it’s the woman in this picture. She finally has a face.
BACK TO:=>Boyer.
BOYER=>He’s escaped!
BOYER=>Why, Tom? Why?
TOM SHEALY=>You know why, Frank.
KOZLOW=>Hello, young man.
KOZLOW=>At last we meet. NATHAN
NATHAN=>You killed her... KOZLOW
QUICK FLASHBACK:=>- The CN Tower - The Suitcase on the bed
BACK TO.=>Kozlow.
QUICK FLASHBACK:=>Nathan’s mother, Lorna, years earlier, is GASPING for air, while Kozlow kneels over her.
KOZLOW=>...What you’re feeling right now, is your nervous system deteriorating. If you answer my question correctly, you can keep the mask. If not, I will keep the mask. Do you understand?
WOMAN=>And in that one time... you’ll get the same answer.
BACK TO:=>Kozlow:
QUICK FLASHBACK:=>Nathan, under the bed with the mask on, watches his mother take her last breath... He’s terrified. He watches Kozlow and Becker’s feet, as they exit the room. The sirens from below get LOUDER. He looks at his mother... she’s gone.
BACK TO:=>Kozlow.
BING.=>The elevator doors open to the higher Sky Pod, an observation deck over 1,400 feet above the ground. The view is breathtaking -- overseeing 70 miles of land, city and ocean.
DING.=>Nathan gets behind the Guard. The elevator opens, revealing Becker with his Semi-automatic. He starts SHOOTING up the place -- beginning with the Guards. Nathan shields himself with the Guard, as TOURISTS and PATRONS SCREAM and run for their lives. Becker has gone completely mad, BLOWING out half the windows as people duck for cover. A harsh WIND comes in from the outside, SUCKING some people over the ledge. Nathan pulls the gun from the dead Guard’s holster, but Becker runs at him, strong. Nathan starts running towards the ledge, as Becker SHOOTS at him. Nathan slips and falls over the edge, catching the floor railing. His gun slides over to Karen. Nathan dangles off the side of the Space Deck, watching another FEMALE TOURIST lose her grasp and fall to her death.
SNIPER=>But, she never showed up.
DING.=>The elevator opens, and numerous TORONTO POLICE OFFICERS and OFFICIALS storm out, on to the deck. But only Karen is in their sights when they arrive.
WESLEY=>Open up! Police!
STAY WITH MARTIN=>Martin adjusts his bow tie, and puts on a sharp tuxedo jacket. He grabs a tiny handgun off the sink, and places it in his inside pocket.
