DAVID=>No, that’s okay.
FEMALE V.O.=>Inside the wardrobe were four identical khaki chino trousers, four identical claret polo shirts, a belt, socks, underwear, a blazer, four sky-blue shirts, a striped tie, a black plastic watch, a pair of sunglasses, a white bathrobe and Acqua di Parma cologne for men. He thought they most probably give the women the same cologne but for women. Maybe the man with the bad leg could become his friend.
DAVID=>Good afternoon.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN=>I’m sorry, I’ve got blood on you. But don’t worry. There are many ways to remove blood stains from clothes quite easily. One is to wash the item in cold water and then rub it with sea salt. Another is to scrub the stains with cotton wool dipped in ammonia.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN=>The third way is to use water and flour mixed into a paste, like toothpaste, especially if the clothes are delicate or brightly coloured. But never use hot water on blood. Ever.
HOTEL MANAGER=>I imagine you know that masturbation is not permitted in the rooms or in any other area of the hotel.
HOTEL MANAGER=>Do you have it with you?
LISPING MAN=>I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
DAVID’S FATHER=>This is a very nice room.
DAVID=>That’s a shame.
DAVID=>That’s awful. Just awful.
LIMPING MAN=>I want to talk to you.
DAVID=>May I join you?
DAVID=>My time ran out.
LONER LEADER=>We must get a move on now. It’s really too dangerous to stay here. The hotel guests could be here any minute.
LONER LEADER=>What about the shampoo?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN=>Do you have astigmatism too?
LONER LEADER=>Why aren’t you dancing?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN=>No, someone brought me them.
DAVID=>Now down. Left and right.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN=>But I do. I’m sure I have a notebook with white pages, it’s in here somewhere, I’m sure of it.
DAVID=>Good afternoon.
DAVID=>Are you thirsty?
