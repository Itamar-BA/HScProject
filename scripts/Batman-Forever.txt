GUARD=>Hell of a night, huh Doc?
BURTON=>Hell's in here.
DR. BURTON=>Mr. Dent...
DR. BURTON=>Counselor...
DR. BURTON=>Harvey....
DR. BURTON=>Harvey are you alright...
NEWSCASTER=>...And in Gotham City, ex-District Attorney Harvey Dent escaped from Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
NEWSCASTER=>Dent, once Gotham's leading contender for Mayor, was horribly scarred during an indictment hearing over a year ago.
NEWSCASTER=>Dent, whose left-brain was damaged during the assault, launched a grizzly crime spree before being captured by The Batman. He is extremely dangerous. Repeat....
BRUCE=>Uh... great, could you wait a second...
ASSISTANT=>The Mayor's office called again -
SOCIETY MATRON=>Who are you asking to the circus -
SECRETARY=>Five minutes to your inspection -
BRUCE=>Stop!
BRUCE=>Okay, I want you all to just stand here for fifteen seconds, okay? Fifteen, everybody got it?
BRUCE=>Good. Nobody move, now.
BRUCE=>I gotta give myself a raise...
STICKLEY=>Your weekly inspections are a departmental highlight.
BRUCE=>Really? You all need to get out more.
EDWARD=>We'll probably go to the house for dinner. Yes. Yes. Maybe he'll throw a little party in my honor.
EDWARD=>Idiot! Should have rented a tuxedo. Relax. I'm sure Wayne manor has extra. After all, we're almost the same size.
EDWARD=>Oh my God. It's him.
STICKLEY=>Well, Mr. Wayne, on to R&D?
BRUCE=>Mr...?
EDWARD=>Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
BRUCE=>Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
EDWARD=>Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone. Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
BRUCE=>I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
EDWARD=>What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol. And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
BRUCE=>Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
EDWARD=>Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
STICKLEY=>I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
EDWARD=>Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
EDWARD=>Man's greatest tool is...The mind.
EDWARD=>Voila. While holographically enhancing any TV picture, my invention connects directly to the viewer's brain, puts the audience inside the show. Think of the entertainment problems we can solve.
STICKLEY=>I can think of a couple problems that need solving right here.
EDWARD=>Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king. Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
STICKLEY=>Paranoid? The psychotic?
EDWARD=>...The Box can change their lives. Our stock coupons will spike.
EDWARD=>Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
STICKLEY=>Fred?
EDWARD=>Wayne Enterprises will spearhead an entertainment revolution.
EDWARD=>I just need a bit of additional funding. For human trials. Let me show you....
BRUCE=>Maybe some other time..
EDWARD=>I want you to know, we'll be full partners in this, Bruce. What talks we'll have, late into the night. Now, I'm not used to business travel, so go easy on me. As for recognition, I'm sure after a time I'll get used to it. Look at us. Two of a kind.
EDWARD=>Bruce...?
BRUCE=>Call my secretary, she'll set something up. Factory looks great, folks. Keep up the good work.
EDWARD=>Wait. You can't go.
BRUCE=>We'll talk some other -
EDWARD=>No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
BRUCE=>I'm sorry, Edward. Just feels a bit like mind manipulation. It raises too many question marks.
STICKLEY=>Alright everyone, back to work. We'll discuss this later.
EDWARD=>You were supposed to understand.
EDWARD=>I'll make you understand.
BRUCE=>Lock.
BRUCE=>Capsule.
BRUCE=>Alfred...
ALFRED=>I saw the signal, is. All is ready.
ALFRED=>I suppose I couldn't convince you to take along a sandwich.
BRUCE=>I'll get drive-thru. Go...
TWO-FACE=>You. Sport. Any thoughts? Counting on Batass to rescue you?
TWO-FACE=>_We_ sure are.
GUARD=>...You gonna kill me?
TWO-FACE=>Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
GUARD=>I got family. ...Please.
TWO-FACE=>What say we flip for it?
TWO-FACE=>What could be fairer than the random toss of an honest coin? Life...
TWO-FACE=>...or death.
GUARD=>Please. I swear I won't say noth-
TWO-FACE=>The coin _wants_ to decide.
TWO-FACE=>Exhilarating, isn't it? The suspense? Sudden death or a new lease on life? Really makes a man live in the moment.
TWO-FACE=>You're in luck. You get to live to whimper another day.
TWO-FACE=>That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
GUARD=>Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
TWO-FACE=>Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
TWO-FACE=>Did we ask your opinion? The coin has rendered its verdict. This man has a family to take care of. You have a problem with that?
CHASE=>Hot entrance.
BATMAN=>Two-Face?
GORDON=>Two guards dead. He's holding the third hostage. Didn't see this one coming.
CHASE=>We should have, though.
CHASE=>_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
BATMAN=>And you are?
GORDON=>Batman, I'd like you to meet--
CHASE=>Chase Meridian
GORDON=>I asked Dr. Meridian to come to Gotham to consult on this case. She specializes...
BATMAN=>...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
CHASE=>I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table. You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
BATMAN=>Why's that?
CHASE=>Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
BATMAN=>Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
CHASE=>I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
GORDON=>May I remind you two we have a psychopathic murderer on the loose here?
TWO-FACE=>Right on schedule.
TWO-FACE=>At last, The Bat dies!
TWO-FACE=>Kill him too.
GUARD=>Wait! You said you'd let me go!
TWO-FACE=>Never heard of a double-cross?
TWO-FACE=>Come on in, the water's fine.
SWAT LEADER=>Police! Freeze!
TWO-FACE=>Not the guest list we had in mind. Boys, the party's over.
TWO-FACE=>Let's fly.
TWO-FACE=>The man is taking his job _much too seriously_.
TWO-FACE=>That was our money.
TWO-FACE=>He wants to play. Fine, let's play.
PILOT=>Face!!!
TWO-FACE=>Ah, to finally be rid of that pointy eared, steroid eating, rubber suited, cross dressing, night rat...
PILOT=>Uh...boss....
PILOT=>No!
BATMAN=>Harvey, you need help. Give it up.
TWO-FACE=>Words of wisdom from our ex-friend?
TWO-FACE=>Mano a Mano a Bato.
BATMAN=>Surrender.
TWO-FACE=>Ever been to Arkham, Batman? You'd feel right at home. You took a year of my life. So I'm here to pay you back. There's only one way out of this waltz. One of us dies.
BATMAN=>I won't kill you, Harvey.
TWO-FACE=>Batman doesn't kill? Bullshit. You're a killer too.
TWO-FACE=>Goodbye old pal.
EDWARD=>Too many questions. Too many questions.
EDWARD=>I'll show you it works.
STICKLEY=>What the hell is going on here?
STICKLEY=>Your project is terminated. I'm calling security.
EDWARD=>Caffine'll kill you.
EDWARD=>This won't hurt a bit. At least I don't think it will.
STICKLEY=>Goddamnit, you press that button and-
EDWARD=>Loosing resolution. More power.
EDWARD=>Fred Stickley. Come on down. You're the next contestant on I Want Your Brain. Nygma your machine has unexpected side effects. A feed back loop has caused your brain to absorb Stickley's neural energy. Stickley, I've had a break- through! And a breakdown? Maybe. Nevertheless. I'm smarter. Hell, I'm a genius. More than a genius. Several geniuses. Genae. Genie.
EDWARD=>Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons. Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject. Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours. New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah. Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt. Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet. A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
STICKLEY=>...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
EDWARD=>I don't think so.
EDWARD=>Fred. Babe. _You_ are fired. Or should I say Terminated!
EDWARD=>Question marks, Mr. Wayne?
EDWARD=>My work raises too many question marks?
EDWARD=>Two years. 3.5762 percent of my estimated lifespan toiling for your greater glory and profit.
EDWARD=>Well, let me ask you some questions, Mr. Smarter Than Thou. Why are you so debonair? Successful? Richer than God? Why should you have it all and not me? Yes, you're right, there are too many questions, Bruce Wayne.
EDWARD=>Like why hasn't anybody put you in your place? And it's time you came up with some answers. Starting right now!
TWO-FACE=>You're a killer too.
ALFRED=>The dreams again, sir?
BRUCE=>I think they're getting worse.
ALFRED=>It's a wonder you sleep at all.
ALFRED=>What a marvelous shade of purple.
ALFRED=>Really, sir, if you insist on trying to get yourself killed each night.
ALFRED=>...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
BRUCE=>Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
ALFRED=>Hardly a worry, sir.
ALFRED=>Commissioner Gordon phoned. There's been an accident at Wayne Enterprises.
EDWARD=>Why? Oh, why? I can't believe it. Two years. Working in the same office. Shoulder to shoulder, cheek to cheek, ---we're talking face, by the way---and then this. I found this in my cubicle. You'll find the handwriting matches his exactly as does sentence structure and spelling.
GORDON=>We've questioned everyone who worked on the floor. Computer records show no one going in or out after Stickley.
BRUCE=>Computer records can be forged. I'll have my people pull up --
GORDON=>Suicide. With all due respect, leave the police work to us. We'll be in touch.
MARGARET=>The society matrons of Gotham have called a record thirty-two times. Not to mention the press. I think that if they don't know soon who you plan to take to the charity circus, the world will most surely come to an end.
BRUCE=>What's this?
MARGARET=>I don't know. I didn't see anyone...
BRUCE=>No postmark. No stamp.
BRUCE=>The Riddler? Why can't anyone in this town have a normal name?
ALFRED=>Channel 12, sir.
VONDELLE=>--joined us, we're talking about the mutilation of Lady Gotham, caused late last night by Batman-
BRUCE=>_Excuse_ me?!
VONDELLE=>-- will take up to nine months to repair. Today's topic: Batman-crime- fighter or criminal?
BATMAN=>How 'bout Two-Face? Anyone here heard of him?
ROYCE=>Batman is a major cause of crime in Gotham. So-called super-villains seek him out hoping to prove themselves in violent conflict. Batman does not deter crime, he invites it.
VONDELLE=>I'm sure our audience objects to your gender bias. Batperson.
AIMS=>What is the Dark Knight's credo? Batman does not kill? What of those slain during his fight with Jack Napier aka Joker? Or in his Christmas conflict with the orphan Cobblepot? Batman belongs behind bars, not his morally disadvantaged victims.
VONDELLE=>What did you say?
CHASE=>Which part of the word didn't you understand?
BRUCE=>I could like this woman.
CHASE=>Batman is a _reaction_ to the crime in this city, not a creator of it! Without him many more would be dead. Batman is a true hero...
VONDELLE=>Hey, Doc, got the hots for Batman?
VONDELLE=>What do you think? Call us at...
TWO-FACE=>Batman, Batman, Batman. God, we want that man's blood on our hands.
LEATHER=>Oh you are most obscene, my frightful grotesque.
LACE=>Don't listen to her. You're every girl's dream.
LEATHER=>Waste Dorothy and Toto here, you and me can get down to business.
LEATHER=>Harder, baby. Hit me again.
TWO-FACE=>No.
LEATHER=>Sadist.
TWO-FACE=>Too many bats to fry to think about fun. We wanna take him apart limb by hyper-extended limb. Feel his bones crunch in our hands. Beat him until he's as black and blue as that ridiculous rubber suit.
TWO-FACE=>On the other hand, perhaps something slow, a delicious incursion of despair, a campaign to shatter his psyche and bring him crumbling to his knees.
TWO-FACE=>Hell. Why wait? Rupture his organs. Shatter his spine. Still have time for a late dinner.
TWO-FACE=>But simple murder? It's just too damn simple. Besides, it's been done. No. We need a plan.
TWO-FACE=>Yes. Something senseless, brutal, savage, violent.
TWO-FACE=>Yet witty.
BRUCE=>How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
ALFRED=>A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
BRUCE=>It'll never work.
ALFRED=>I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
ALFRED=>Scholarly research?
BRUCE=>She has an excellent mind.
ALFRED=>If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
BRUCE=>I wonder if she'd go out with me.
ALFRED=>Apology hastily retracted.
BRUCE=>They don't understand. They think I became Batman to fight crime.
BRUCE=>Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
ALFRED=>Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
BRUCE=>...The night Batman was born. What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
ALFRED=>I don't know, sir. Your dear parents. Suddenly gone. So much loss...
BRUCE=>I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me. In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong. They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
ALFRED=>Perhaps it's time you paid a bit more attention to Bruce Wayne. There was no one at the door, just this.
MRS. LUCERTOLA=>Ya wanna cough up your rent, or do I post an eviction notice?
EDWARD=>Mrs. Lucertola. What a surprise. Come in. I was just sitting down to write the check.
MRS. LUCERTOLA=>What is it exactly that you do, Mr. Nygma?
EDWARD=>My dear Ms. Lucertola. Italian, isn't it? For lizard. How fitting. I think the question better asked: what is it that I don't do?
EDWARD=>Most recently I have devised a way to change the destiny of mankind and the world as we know it, all in my favor of course.
MRS. LUCERTOLA=>The rent Nygma!!!
EDWARD=>Might I persuade you to take a seat on this couch? To indulge me in a little experiment?
MRS. LUCERTOLA=>Hey, I got no time for-
EDWARD=>Showtime.
MRS. LUCERTOLA=>My favorite story.
EDWARD=>Yes. TV. Balm to the minds of the masses. The great deadener. If only it were more lively. But wait. I can help.
MRS. LUCERTOLA=>Oh my lord.
EDWARD=>Not quite. But I'm getting there.
EDWARD=>Now this is much better. No pain. Just a little holographic TV to keep your mind off the fact...
EDWARD=>...That I'm taking your mind. Not your thoughts, mind you. Just your neural energy, simply sucking some IQ points as it were.
EDWARD=>His intelligence jumps. Ms. Lizard don't know it. The crowd goes wild. Boys, I want one of these babies in every home. It's the new information super highway and, pay attention now kids. I'm the on ramp. From their brains to the TV to my brain, with no commercial interruptions! There are seven million brains in the Naked City... ...and they're all mine!
CHASE=>Mr. Wayne. Chase Meridian.
CHASE=>How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
BRUCE=>Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
CHASE=>Psychiatrists make you nervous?
BRUCE=>Just ones this beautiful.
CHASE=>The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
BRUCE=>On occasion. Usually at night.
BRUCE=>Still play with dolls, Doctor?
CHASE=>She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams. Need one?
BRUCE=>Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
CHASE=>My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
BRUCE=>Wacko? That a technical term?
CHASE=>Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
BRUCE=>So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
CHASE=>Exactly.
BRUCE=>You have a thing for bats?
CHASE=>That's a rorschach, Mr. Wayne. People see what they want to.
CHASE=>I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
BRUCE=>So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
CHASE=>What do you know about obsession?
BRUCE=>Not much.
BRUCE=>It's a stretch but I'll manage.
CHASE=>The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
BRUCE=>To kill me.
CHASE=>You understand obsession better than you let on.
BRUCE=>No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch. Oops. Times up.
CHASE=>That's usually my line.
BRUCE=>Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
CHASE=>Would you? I'm not so sure.
BRUCE=>But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
CHASE=>Excuse me.
BRUCE=>And into a black dress.
BRUCE=>Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?
RINGMASTER=>Ladies and gentlemen. Seventy feet above the ground, performing feats of aerial skill without a net, the Flying Graysons!
CHASE=>I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
BRUCE=>I'm sorry. Who are you?
BRUCE=>Now we can just sit back and watch the show like normal folks.
RINGMASTER=>Tonight's benefit has raised $375,000 for Gotham Children's Hospital. Let's thank our largest single donor: Bruce Wayne.
CHASE=>Like normal folks.
BRUCE=>What? This isn't normal?
RINGMASTER=>And now Richard, the youngest Flying Grayson, will perform The _Quadruple_ Flying Somersault!
BRUCE=>That kid is amazing.
CHASE=>I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
BRUCE=>Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
CHASE=>The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
BRUCE=>Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
BRUCE=>Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
CHASE=>Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
BRUCE=>But...
CHASE=>Well, I met someone...
BRUCE=>Fast work. You just moved here.
CHASE=>You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
BRUCE=>He sure did.
CHASE=>What?
BRUCE=>I said I'm sure he did.
TWO-FACE=>Ladies and gentlemen, and I do use the term loosely, your attentions please. Tonight, a new act for your amusement. We call it Massacre Under the Big Top.
TWO-FACE=>People, people. Show some grace under pressure. A little decorum, please. _SHUT UP_!!!
TWO-FACE=>If we may direct your attention...
TWO-FACE=>Inside that wooden box: two hundred sticks of TNT. In our hand: a radio detonator.
TWO-FACE=>You have three minutes.
THE MAYOR=>What the hell do you want?
TWO-FACE=>Want, Mr. Mayor? Just one little thing. Batman. Bruised. Broken. Bleeding. In a word: dead.
TWO-FACE=>Who do we have assembled before us? Gotham's finest. Rich, Influential. Smart. One of you must know who Batman is. Hell, we'd lay odds one of you _is_ Batman.
TWO-FACE=>So, unless the bat is surrendered to us post haste, we're off on a proverbial killing spree. City wide mayhem and murder. Starting tonight. With all you lovely folks as our very first corpses to be. You have three ---well just under three--- minutes.
TWO-FACE=>Boys! Move, move, move! Cannot get good help these days.
CHRIS=>Go! We'll hold them off!
BRUCE=>Show's over.
TWO-FACE=>Day in, day out, it always comes down to the same old question. Life... Or death.
TWO-FACE=>Our kinda day.
TWO-FACE=>Never did like the circus. Too many freaks.
DICK=>No!!!!
GORDON=>It's good of you to take him in. He's been filling out forms all day. He hasn't even eaten.
ALFRED=>Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
DICK=>How ya doin', Al?
ALFRED=>Al?
DICK=>Big house. How many rooms?
BRUCE=>Gee, I'm not sure. Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
ALFRED=>Ninety-three, including the sauna.
BRUCE=>Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
DICK=>Okay. I'm outta here.
BRUCE=>Excuse me.
DICK=>I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
BRUCE=>Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
DICK=>I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
BRUCE=>Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
DICK=>Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
BRUCE=>It's not just the sadness. Is it? The shame is worse. Feeling like somehow you should have saved them.
BRUCE=>You're right. I don't know you. But I'm like you.
ALFRED=>Oh, is the young master leaving? Pity. I'll just toss this away then. Perhaps the dogs are hungry -
ALFRED=>I'll set this up in the guest suite. Just in case.
ALFRED=>Master Bruce?
BRUCE=>It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
ALFRED=>What did you say?
BRUCE=>He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
ALFRED=>No. You said I. I killed them.
BRUCE=>Don't be ridiculous.
DICK=>Hey?.. Hello?... Anybody home?
BATMAN=>Commissioner...?
CHASE=>He's home. I sent the signal.
BATMAN=>What's wrong?
CHASE=>Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
BATMAN=>You called me here for this? The Batsignal is not a beeper.
CHASE=>I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
BATMAN=>Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
CHASE=>A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
BATMAN=>It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
CHASE=>What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
CHASE=>Now black rubber.
BATMAN=>Try a fireman. Less to take off.
CHASE=>I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
BATMAN=>We all wear masks.
CHASE=>My life's an open book. You read?
BATMAN=>I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
CHASE=>We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
BATMAN=>You are direct, aren't you?
CHASE=>You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
BATMAN=>I haven't had much luck with women...
CHASE=>Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
GORDON=>I saw the beacon. What's going on?
BATMAN=>Nothing... False alarm.
CHASE=>Are you sure?
TWO-FACE=>Ever have one of those days where you just want to kill someone?
VOICE IN THE DARK=>Riddle me this.
VOICE IN THE DARK=>The answer is, your enemy.
TWO-FACE=>Who are you?
VOICE IN THE DARK=>You can just call me... The Riddler.
TWO-FACE=>How'd you find us?
RIDDLER=>You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
TWO-FACE=>Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.
RIDDLER=>Has anyone ever told you have a serious impulse control problem? You know, I simply love what you've done with this place. Heavy Metal with just a touch of House and Garden.
RIDDLER=>It's so dark and Gothic and disgustingly decadent...
RIDDLER=>Yet so bright and chipper and conservative! It's so you. And yet so _you_! Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
TWO-FACE=>A man with a death wish.
RIDDLER=>Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
TWO-FACE=>Let's see if you bleed green.
RIDDLER=>Alright, counselor. Go ahead. Fire away. But before you do, let me ask you one question. Is it really me you want to kill?
RIDDLER=>Do you know about hate, my dual visaged friend? Slow, burning hate that keeps you sleepless until late in the night, that wakes you before dawn. Do you know that kind of hate? I do. Kill him? Seems like a good enough idea. But have you thought it through? A few bullets, a quick spray of blood, a fast, thrilling rush, and then what? Wet hands and post-coital depression. Is it really enough? Why not ruin him first? Expose his frailty. And then, when he is at his weakest, crush him in your hand.
RIDDLER=>...Take a hit.
RIDDLER=>Up, up, up.
TWO-FACE=>Holy shit.
RIDDLER=>So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
RIDDLER=>This is your brain on the box. This is your brain on their brain.
RIDDLER=>This is my brain on your brain on their brain. Does anybody else feel like a fried egg?
TWO-FACE=>No. Wait...
RIDDLER=>Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
TWO-FACE=>You are a very strange person. You speak as if we are old friends, which we are not. You barge in here unarmed when it is clearly suicidal to do so. Still, an intriguing proposition. Heads: we take your offer.
TWO-FACE=>Tails: we blow your _goddamned head off_!
ANCHOR=>...working with Two-Face, Gotham's new criminal mastermind is calling himself The Riddler. Twenty million in diamonds were stolen yesterday with no sign of Batman.
ANCHOR=>In other news, entrepreneur Edward Nygma has signed a lease for Claw Island. Nygma says he plans to break ground on an electronics plant....
TWO-FACE=>Close your fist. Reach back.
TWO-FACE=>Get it?
TWO-FACE=>Riddler. You punch like a girl. Put some heart into it.
RIDDLER=>Okay. Okay. I got it.
TWO-FACE=>My God.
ALFRED=>May I help you, Master Grayson?
DICK=>How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
ALFRED=>Master Wayne's dead wives.
VONDELLE=>Has Batman lost his touch? We've become a city of sissies crying Batman, Batman, Batman at the first sign of trouble.
RIDDLER=>I just love a captive audience.
RIDDLER=>Oh, but all I want is to take all your jewels oh oh. No, oh you villain don't take my jewels, oh no. I will. No you won't. I will. No you won't.
TWO-FACE=>Where are you sending Batboy this time?
RIDDLER=>Here. Get a good seat.
EDWARD=>Why sit back when you can be part of the show?
EDWARD=>...Nygmatech brings the joy 3-D entertainment into your own home.
EDWARD=>Ladies and gentlemen. Let me tell you my vision for the future. "The Box" in every home in America. And one day, the world.
BRUCE=>Riddler and Two-Face are tweaking the data before the computer pulls it off the emergency bands.
TWO-FACE=>Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
RIDDLER=>Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
RIDDLER=>Be my guest.
TWO-FACE=>Our Paleolithic yearnings are best expressed in a pre-linguistic- Sorry. Just thinking out loud.
RIDDLER=>Not until you do that thing I like. On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie... Woah. Harsh toke.
TWO-FACE=>Don't bogart that 'trode.
TWO-FACE=>Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
RIDDLER=>About what?
TWO-FACE=>Everything.
AIMS=>This Box is nothing more than an electronic narcotic.
ROYCE=>Thousands more Gothamites each day are tuning out by tuning in to its holographic fantasies.
AIMS=>It's turning citizens into zombies...
VONDELLE=>Gripe, gripe, gripe. Isn't this what they said about TV? I think "The Box" is the future. What's your opinion? I want to know...
ALFRED=>Master Dick?
DICK=>Up here, Al.
ALFRED=>Just checking, young sir.
DICK=>Four seconds from...
DICK=>Now!
BRUCE=>The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles? Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
CHASE=>Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
BRUCE=>What's this?
CHASE=>Call it clinical intuition. I thought your dreams might need changing.
BRUCE=>My parents were murdered. In front of me. I was just a kid.
BRUCE=>A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
CHASE=>And now....
BRUCE=>They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
CHASE=>Damn. I'll be right back.
CHASE=>Find anything interesting?
BRUCE=>Why do I feel like the other man, here?
CHASE=>Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
BRUCE=>I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
CHASE=>What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
CHASE=>Look at the abuse he's taking. He's not just fighting criminals. He's punishing himself.
CHASE=>It's as if he's paying some great penance. What crime could he have committed to deserve a life sentence of such agony?
BRUCE=>Maybe he just had a lousy childhood, is that it Doc?
CHASE=>Why do you do that?
BRUCE=>What?
CHASE=>Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
BRUCE=>I'm not-
CHASE=>You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
CHASE=>In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
BRUCE=>Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
ALFRED=>Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
BRUCE=>Is he all right?
ALFRED=>I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
BRUCE=>He ran away?
ALFRED=>Actually, he took the car.
BRUCE=>He boosted the Jag? Is that all?
ALFRED=>Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
BRUCE=>The _Rolls_?
ALFRED=>_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
THUG=>Who the hell are you?
DICK=>I'm Batman. Damn, did I forget to dress again?
DICK=>Chains. You don't seem like the type.
DICK=>The Caped Crusader strikes again. Sans cape, of course.
DICK=>Another victory for the Dark Knight.
DICK=>Dark nighty-night.
DICK=>Is your will up to date?
DICK=>I could definitely get behind this super hero gig.
DICK=>Ma'am.
GIRL=>Wait.
GIRL=>You forgot the part where you kiss the girl.
DICK=>Right.
DICK=>Uh-oh.
GIRL=>Don't you want my number?
DICK=>I need to be part of this.
BRUCE=>Absolutely not.
DICK=>Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
BRUCE=>What I do isn't about revenge.
DICK=>Right, slick. Whatever you say.
BRUCE=>This isn't a game.
DICK=>Back off, man.
BRUCE=>You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice. I want better for you.
DICK=>Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
BRUCE=>Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
ALFRED=>I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
CHASE=>If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
BRUCE=>Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
CHASE=>Touchy, touchy.
BRUCE=>So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
CHASE=>Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
BRUCE=>Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman. Can I?
NEWSCASTER=>You're outselling Wayne Enterprises. Any comments?
EDWARD=>Actually, I'm outselling Wayne Tech two to one...
JOURNALIST=>The Times has named you Gotham's bachelor of the year. What do you have to say about that?
EDWARD=>You might want to ask Bruce Wayne. Bruce, old man!
EDWARD=>So glad you could come.
BRUCE=>What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
EDWARD=>The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way... And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
CHASE=>Chase?
EDWARD=>Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be. What do you think of my new invention?
BRUCE=>What? Oh, it's very impressive.
EDWARD=>Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
EDWARD=>No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms. Skol.
BRUCE=>Nostrovia.
EDWARD=>La'chiem.
BRUCE=>Slanta.
EDWARD=>Rinka.
BRUCE=>Banzai.
CHASE=>I'm drinking.
EDWARD=>I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
BRUCE=>Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
BRUCE=>And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
CHASE=>Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
EDWARD=>Quite right. Shall we dance?
SHOWGIRL=>Naughty, naughty.
TWO-FACE=>Alright, folks, this is an old- fashioned, low-tech stick-up. We're interested in the basics: jewelry, cash, watches, high-end cellular phones. Hand 'em over nice and easy and no one gets hurt.
BRUCE=>Emergency, Alfred.
EDWARD=>You're ruining my big party. Are you insane? Actually, considering your dual persona, let's just forget the question.
TWO-FACE=>We're sick of waiting for you to deliver The Bat, Riddle boy. You promised us Batman.
EDWARD=>Patience, oh bifurcated one.
TWO-FACE=>Screw patience. We want him dead. An nothing brings out The Bat like a little mayhem and murder.
EDWARD=>Oh well, in that case. As long as you were going to rob me, you could have at least let me in on the caper. We could have _organized_ this, _planned it_, pre-sold the movie rights.
EDWARD=>Harv, babe, I gotta be honest. Your entrance was good. His was better. What's the difference? Showmanship.
VONDELLE=>Batman, Batman, Batman help!
VONDELLE=>Batman. You're my _God_!!!
BATMAN=>Excuse me.
CHASE=>Call me.
TWO-FACE=>Okay boys. Phase two.
THUG=>Bat's right behind us.
TWO-FACE=>Excellent.
TWO-FACE=>Nothing worse than a bad case of gas.
TWO-FACE=>Lights. Camera. Action.
TWO-FACE=>Finally.
THUG=>It can't be.
TWO-FACE=>Why won't you just die?!
TWO-FACE=>Boys, let's go have us a party. Anybody else feel like donuts?
BRUCE=>What the hell did you think you were doing?
DICK=>You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
BRUCE=>How about Richard Grayson, college student?
DICK=>...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
BRUCE=>We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
DICK=>I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
BRUCE=>It's starting all over again, Alfred. Another boy lost to rage. And it's my fault. If Harvey hadn't come gunning for me at the circus...His family...
BRUCE=>Maybe they're right.
ALFRED=>Which `they' might that be, sir?
BRUCE=>Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
BRUCE=>Why do I keep doing this?
ALFRED=>Why, indeed?
BRUCE=>Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
ALFRED=>Dr. Meridian...
BRUCE=>She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
ALFRED=>Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
BRUCE=>How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
PHONE=>Hello?..Hello?..Who is this?
BRUCE=>Who am I Alfred? I don't think I know anymore.
CHASE=>I'm sorry. I can't believe it. I've imagined this moment since I first saw you. Your hands. Your face. Your body.
CHASE=>And now I have you and.... Guess a girl has to grow up sometime.
CHASE=>I've met someone. He's not...you. But... I hope you can understand.
TWO-FACE=>You know, Ed, we woke up this morning, we just knew we were gonna kill something. The Bat got away. Looks like it's gonna be you.
TWO-FACE=>Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
RIDDLER=>Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours. Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
RIDDLER=>Too...bad...about...Batman.
TWO-FACE=>What about Batman?
RIDDLER=>What if you could know a man's mind? Would you not then own that man?
RIDDLER=>A few dozen extra IQ points and my little invention learned a new trick. It does more than drain your brain. It makes a map of your mind.
RIDDLER=>Would you like to see what my old friend Bruce has in his head.
RIDDLER=>Riddle me this, what kind of man has bats on the brain?
RIDDLER=>Go ahead. You can say it.
TWO-FACE=>You're a genius.
KIDS=>Happy Halloween.
BRUCE=>Happy Halloween.
BATMAN=>...Tonight it ends.
DICK=>What the hell do you mean, it ends?
BRUCE=>From this day on, Batman is no more.
DICK=>You can't-.
BRUCE=>Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
DICK=>But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
BRUCE=>And when you finally get Two-Face?
BRUCE=>Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me. All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
DICK=>Bruce, you can't.
BRUCE=>Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
RIDDLER=>And today not even my birthday.
TWO-FACE=>Bruce, Batman. Bruce, Batman.
BRUCE=>There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
CHASE=>Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
CHASE=>Let me go first, okay? I think I've found something. About your dreams. I pulled the files on your parents' murders. There was a missing diary, Bruce. Alfred told the police your father always kept it on his desk. But the day after the murders, it was gone. Maybe that's the book you're-
CHASE=>What is it? What's wrong?
BRUCE=>Flashes. Images. Of that night.
CHASE=>Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
BRUCE=>I don't want to remember!
CHASE=>Stop fighting.
BRUCE=>My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
CHASE=>What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
BRUCE=>I don't-.
CHASE=>You do know. Try.
BRUCE=>The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight. Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater... It was my fault. I killed them.
CHASE=>Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
BRUCE=>...Not the bat?
CHASE=>What?
BRUCE=>I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
CHASE=>What are you talking about?
BRUCE=>Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
LITTLE VOICE=>Trick or Treat?
RIDDLER=>Trick.
TWO-FACE=>Get the girl.
BRUCE=>What the hell?
RIDDLER=>What's that I hear?
RIDDLER=>Why it must be the fat lady getting ready to sing.
RIDDLER=>Gonna have a hot time in the old town tonight. Who used to say that? Somebody always used to say that.
BRUCE=>Go!
TWO-FACE=>See ya.
TWO-FACE=>Bruce, you sure know how to throw a party.
RIDDLER=>Sheath your weapon my impetuous cohort.
TWO-FACE=>We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
RIDDLER=>Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
RIDDLER=>My poor sweet hero.
RIDDLER=>We'll kill him alright. But first... Boys.
CHASE=>Bruce!
RIDDLER=>...We're going to make him suffer.
DOCTOR=>The injuries are relatively minor. The shot did cause a concussion. Watch for headaches. Memory lapses. Odd behavior. I'll check back in a few days.
ALFRED=>How are you feeling, young man?
BRUCE=>Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
ALFRED=>Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
BRUCE=>As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
ALFRED=>Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
BRUCE=>The case? What cave?
GORDON=>Where is he?
DEPUTY=>The Mayor's called again. He's not going to show. Maybe he's hurt sir. Maybe he's--.
GORDON=>No! ...No.
BRUCE=>I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne. But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
ALFRED=>Perhaps the fall...
BRUCE=>There's one other thing. I feel..
ALFRED=>What?
BRUCE=>...Afraid.
ALFRED=>Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
BRUCE=>...A bat.
ALFRED=>What?
BRUCE=>I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me. Oh my God, Alfred.
ALFRED=>No demons, son. Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
RIDDLER=>It's happy time Gotham. Have you hugged your little boxes today? I'm in heaven. I'm in heaven with a girl like you.
CHASE=>Batman will come for me.
RIDDLER=>Someday my bat will come. Some day my bat will come. I'm counting on it.
CHASE=>You're frying your brain.
RIDDLER=>Nap time gorgeous.
BRUCE=>Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight...
BRUCE=>But Martha and I have our hearts set on Zorro, so Bruce's cartoon will have to wait until next week.
BRUCE=>...Not my fault. It wasn't my fault.
ALFRED=>Master, Bruce?
BRUCE=>...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
BRUCE=>All the answers are numbers.
ALFRED=>But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
BRUCE=>What do maniacs always want?
ALFRED=>Recognition, of course.
BRUCE=>Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
BRUCE=>Letters in the alphabet.
ALFRED=>Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
BRUCE=>How about, MR. E.
ALFRED=>Mystery.
BRUCE=>And another name for Mystery?
ALFRED=>Enigma.
BRUCE=>Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
BRUCE=>Good thing Mr. E. didn't know about the cave under the cave.
ALFRED=>What now sir?
BRUCE=>Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase. Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
ALFRED=>All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
BRUCE=>Tonight's a good night.
BATMAN=>What do you suggest, Alfred. By see or by air?
DICK=>Why not both?
BATMAN=>Dick... Where did you get that suit?
ALFRED=>I...um..took the liberty, sir.
DICK=>I thought you could use a friend.
BATMAN=>Not a friend.
BATMAN=>A partner.
GORDON=>He's not coming. Shut it down.
RIDDLER=>A-14.
TWO-FACE=>Miss.
TWO-FACE=>B-12.
RIDDLER=>A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
TWO-FACE=>A hit.
RIDDLER=>You sunk my battleship.
DICK=>Holy rusted metal, Batman.
BATMAN=>What?
DICK=>The ground. It's metal and its full of holes. You know. Holey.
BATMAN=>This place was a refueling station for subs during the war...
BATMAN=>Dick.
TWO-FACE=>The Bat or the Bird. We couldn't decide who got to kill who. Or is it whom?
TWO-FACE=>We flipped for it. We got you.
TWO-FACE=>What's wrong, circus-boy? No mommy and daddy to save you?
DICK=>For my mother.
DICK=>For my father.
DICK=>For Chris.
DICK=>For me.
TWO-FACE=>The scales are tipped. The blindfold torn from the lady's eyes. Justice will be served.
TWO-FACE=>You're a man after my own heart, son.
TWO-FACE=>See you in hell.
DICK=>No. I'd rather see you in jail.
TWO-FACE=>The Bat's taught you well. Noble.
TWO-FACE=>A mistake. But definitely noble.
RIDDLER=>Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
BATMAN=>No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
TWO-FACE=>And me and me.
BATMAN=>...Of course. The Box does more than enhance neural energy. You've been sucking Gotham's brainwaves.
RIDDLER=>And now it's new. Improved. Better than ever.
BATMAN=>...The jolt I felt in the beam at your party. You've devised a way to map the human brain. To read men's minds.
RIDDLER=>Oh, Bruce, you are clever. How fitting that numbers lead you to me. For numbers will crown me king. My Box will sit on countless TV's around the globe, mapping brains, giving me credit card numbers. Bank codes. Safe combinations. Numbers of infidelities. Of crimes. Of lies told. No secret is safe from my watchful electronic eye. I will rule the planet. For if knowledge is power then tremble world, Edward Nygma has become a God. Was that over the top? I can never tell... By the way, B-man, I got _your_ number.
RIDDLER=>I've seen your mind. Yours is the greatest Riddle of all. Can Bruce Wayne and Batman ever truly coexist? Stop me if I'm wrong here.
RIDDLER=>So let's help you decide, once and for all, who you really are. Behind Curtain #1...
RIDDLER=>The captivating Dr. Chase Meridian. Love of Bruce Wayne's life. Behind curtain #2...
RIDDLER=>Batman's one and only partner. Below, my personal favorite...
RIDDLER=>A watery grave!
RIDDLER=>A simple touch and five seconds later these two day players are so much gull feed on the rocks below. Not enough time to save them both. So who will it be? Bruce's love? Batman's partner? You decide. Is this fun or what?
BATMAN=>Edward, you've become a monster.
RIDDLER=>You flatter me. No monster. Just The Riddler, and here's yours. What is without taste or sound, all around, but can't be found? On your mark, get set...
BATMAN=>Death. Death. Without taste, sound and all around us. Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
RIDDLER=>Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
BATMAN=>Wait. I have a riddle for you.
RIDDLER=>For _me_? Really? Tell me.
BATMAN=>I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
RIDDLER=>Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
BATMAN=>Exactly!
RIDDLER=>No!
TWO-FACE=>All those heroics for nothing. No more riddles, no more curtains one and two. Just plain old curtains.
BATMAN=>Haven't you forgotten something, Harvey? You're always of two minds about everything....
TWO-FACE=>Oh. Emotion is so often the enemy of justice. Thank you, Bruce.
TWO-FACE=>No!
BATMAN=>Help Chase. I'll be back.
CHASE=>Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
DICK=>Of course not.
RIDDLER=>Why can't I kill you? Now there's a riddle? Not smart enough. Find a way. Too many questions. Why you and not me? Why me? Why??!!
BATMAN=>Poor, Edward. I had to save them both. You see, I am Bruce Wayne and Batman. Not because I have to be. Now because I choose to be.
DR. BURTON=>Edward Nygma has been screaming for hours that he knows the true identity of Batman.
CHASE=>Edward...
EDWARD=>Who is it?
CHASE=>It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
EDWARD=>How could I forget?
CHASE=>Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
EDWARD=>Yesssssss. I know!
CHASE=>Who is The Batman, Edward?
EDWARD=>Can't tell if you don't say please.
CHASE=>You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
CHASE=>Edward, please. Who is Batman?
EDWARD=>I AM BATMAAAAAAANN!!!
CHASE=>Alfred?
ALFRED=>Mr. Wayne sent me to pick you up.
CHASE=>Where's Bruce?
ALFRED=>He asked me to convey his deepest apologies, Dr. Meridian. But he wanted me to give you this.
ALFRED=>He said to thank you. And to tell you he no longer needs it.
CHASE=>Does it ever end Alfred?
ALFRED=>No, Miss. Not in this lifetime.
