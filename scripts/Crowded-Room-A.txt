DONNA=>He had some kind of stain or something on his hands.
KLEBERG=>Stain? What, like dirt?
BOXERBAUM=>Oil?
DONNA=>No. They were blue. Dark blue. All over his fingers.
KLEBERG=>Ink?
DONNA=>No. I don't know what it was. But it had a funny smell to it.
DONNA=>Oh, God, I don't know. I can't think.
BOXERBAUM=>Alright, don't worry about his hands. Just try and tell us whatever you remember so that we can get a statement.
DONNA=>It was about eight A.M. and I was getting out of my car in the parking lot.
KLEBERG=>This is at Ohio State?
DONNA=>Yes, I'm an optometry student there.
DONNA=>I had gone around to the passenger side to pick up some books, and as I was leaning in...
BILLY=>Would you please get in the car?
DONNA=>Where are we going?
DONNA=>I know this is gonna sound ridiculous, but I have an optometry test today...
BILLY=>You can study for it if you want. This won't take long. Go on.
BILLY=>I'm taking these addresses and phone numbers. If you say anything to the police, I'll send someone from my brotherhood after you.
KLEBERG=>His "brotherhood"?
CARRIE=>That's what he said. He belonged to a brotherhood and they'd send someone after me if I said anything.
BOXERBAUM=>Was he high? Could you tell?
CARRIE=>It's weird. There was liquor on his breath... I mean he reeked... but he drove perfectly. In fact, he didn't act drunk at all, except when he would talk to himself.
SKETCH ARTIST=>How's this?
CARRIE=>He didn't have a moustache. He was clean shaven.
BILLY=>Take off your pants.
CARRIE=>What?
BILLY=>Take your fucking pants off!
BILLY=>You won't run away without any pants on.
BILLY=>Are you cold?
BILLY=>Take off your underwear and lay down.
BOXERBAUM=>It's O.K. You want to stop for a while?
POLLY=>No. I'm all right.
KLEBERG=>Did he hit you or push you or hurt you in any way?
POLLY=>No. He wrote me a poem.
BOXERBAUM=>A poem?
POLLY=>A love poem. He never showed it to me because he was afraid you'd trace his handwriting.
BILLY=>Do you know what it's like to be lonely? Not to be held by anyone? Not to know the meaning of love?
DONNA=>It's called nystagmus. I'm an optometry student. I recognized it immediately. An involuntary oscillation of the eyeballs.
CARRIE=>He never took off his glasses. I don't know.
KLEBERG=>Then what happened?
CARRIE=>He... raped... me...
BILLY=>I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances. I really love you.
POLLY=>Then he drove me back into town and made me cash him a check at my bank.
KLEBERG=>Same as the others.
POLLY=>Then he took me to Wendy's.
BOXERBAUM=>Wendy's?
POLLY=>For a burger.
DONNA=>Then we finally went back to the campus and he left. Oh yeah -- he said his name was Phil.
CARRIE=>There's this many criminals around here?
BOXERBAUM=>That's just the young, white male sex offenders. And only the ones who've been arrested.
POLLY=>It sure looks like him... but I can't be sure.
DONNA=>That's him. No doubt about it. I'm positive.
BOXERBAUM=>5673 Old Livingston. That's his current address.
FIRST OFFICER=>Shit. He's not alone.
YOUNG OFFICER=>Pizza. You Billy Milligan?
BILLY=>Who?
YOUNG OFFICER=>Billy Milligan? 5673 Old Livingston?
BILLY=>I'm not Billy Milligan and I didn't order any pizza.
YOUNG OFFICER=>You're sure you're not William Stanley Milligan?
BILLY=>Huh?
YOUNG OFFICER=>Freeze. Police Officer.
BILLY=>What's going on?
FIRST OFFICER=>He's not alone!
SECOND OFFICER=>Alright, motherfuckers, come on out!
YOUNG OFFICER=>Where are they?
BILLY=>Who? There's no one here.
YOUNG OFFICER=>William Milligan, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent...
BLACK PRISONER=>I didn't do nothin' I swear I didn't do nothin'
KLEBERG=>Jesus Christ. It's a fucking arsenal.
FIRST GUARD=>Hey, Jew Boy.
SECOND GUARD=>What do you know -- we have a goddamn Rembrandt on our hands.
FIRST GUARD=>Maybe he can draw himself a new asshole after the cons at Lima get through humpin' the one he's got. They don't look too kindly on rapists over there.
SECOND GUARD=>They sent you down some Kool-Aid. You want it?
SECOND GUARD=>Is that a no?
SECOND GUARD=>Hey, you think we oughta tattoo this Jew Boy?
FIRST GUARD=>Yeah. Put some numbers right there.
SECOND GUARD=>Here ya go, Rembrandt.
KLEBERG=>We do have a suspect in custody. His name is William Stanley Milligan. He has one prior conviction from a run-in with a prostitute.
KLEBERG=>We continue to treat this investigation very carefully and very thoroughly but with the evidence we've already gathered, we feel extremely confident.
GUARD=>O.K., rapist, chow time. We all took turns spitting in your food before I brought it down, but you can ignore that, can't ya? Just pretend it's soup...
GUARD=>Jesus H. Christ.
KLEBERG=>Open and shut. A textbook investigation.
DR. FINK=>Do you know why you're here, Billy?
DR. FINK=>Billy?
BILLY=>Oh.
DR. FINK=>Do you know why you're here?
BILLY=>No.
DR. FINK=>Did you understand what the police officers said when you were arrested?
BILLY=>The... what?
DR. FINK=>Do you know why you've been arrested? Billy?
BILLY=>You should have seen their fuckin' faces when them van doors opened and BOOM!. There I am, out of the cuffs and givin' them the finger. Shit... Whassamatter, Doc, not actin' crazy enough for ya? How's this?
BILLY=>Who do you have to fuck to get somethin' to eat around here? I'm starving. And a lawyer might be nice. What do you say?
BILLY=>The novelty's wearin' thin, you know what I mean? I been in places worse than this in my life, and I'll tell you something... there isn't a box on Earth can hold me. Certainly not this two bit, rinky dink drunk tank.
DR. EDMUNDS=>I'd like to talk to you about the attacks.
BILLY=>Hey, I wasn't there. I don't know what they're talkin' about because I didn't do a fuckin' thing they accused me of. And I don't lie.
DR. EDMUNDS=>I want to play a little game. Write down the first thing that comes into your mind.
DR. HUBBARD=>Are you alright? You look like you're about to fall apart.
BILL=>I'm scared.
DR. HUBBARD=>There's nothing to be scared of. I'm Dr. Hubbard from the Southwest Community Mental Health Center and I'm here to ask you a few questions. Where are you currently living?
BILLY=>Here.
DR. HUBBARD=>What's your Social Security number?
BILLY=>I don't know.
DR. HUBBARD=>Is it 126-44-6218?
BILLY=>I don't know.
DR. HUBBARD=>Billy, if I'm going to help you, you're going to have to try and...
BILLY=>Billy's asleep.
DR. HUBBARD=>What?
BILLY=>Billy's asleep. And the others don't want me to wake him up.
DR. HUBBARD=>What others?
BILLY=>The other people. They want Billy to stay asleep.
DR. HUBBARD=>Who are these other people?
BILLY=>I can't talk about it. I made a mistake telling you. Promise you won't say anything to anyone.
DR. HUBBARD=>I promise. But you have to tell me...
BILLY=>I can't...
DR. HUBBARD=>Alright, you don't have to say anything else, but would you do me a favor?
BILLY=>What?
DR. HUBBARD=>Would you sign your name for me?
BILLY=>O.K.
JUDY=>Multiple personality disorder? You mean like Sybil?
DR. HUBBARD=>Worse -- if one of the personalities is a violent criminal.
JUDY=>With all respect, Doctor, if you were a rapist, caught dead to rights with a ton of evidence in your apartment, wouldn't you try and make up a story, too? Trust me, this is a guy who read a bestseller and got a brainstorm.
DR. HUBBARD=>Maybe, but I don't think so. He's already been seen by three separate doctors because no one could make head of tails of him.
JUDY=>Well, I thought I'd seen it all, but I have to admit "I didn't do it, he did" "No I didn't" "Yes he did" -- that's a new one even to me.
DR. HUBBARD=>Just come in and talk to him with me -- then decide.
JUDY=>We'll represent him no matter what. We have to. But fine-- I only have a caseload that high sitting on my desk while I waste a whole afternoon here...
GARY=>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, Jah Skank Irie, is innocent. For it is not the ganja weed that is on trial here today, only the man... mon.
JUDY=>Gary, put down what you're doing and get your ass down to Franklin with me.
GARY=>Whoa -- don't get your knickers in a twist -- you'll give yourself one of them aneurisms.
JUDY=>I'm serious, Gary. I think you should see this.
GARY=>Billy Milligan?
JUDY=>Yes.
GARY=>Uh uh. Sorry, Judy, one of the perks of getting to be the boss is you don't have to give up all your free time representing the Campus Rapist if you don't want to. And I don't want to. Besides, I already met him before I ordered the psychiatric evaluation, and he specifically asked for a female lawyer.
JUDY=>He's not guilty.
GARY=>Not guilty? They got enough hard evidence to lock him up till doomsday.
JUDY=>I'm telling you, Billy Milligan did not commit those rapes. At least come down and talk to him.
BILLY=>Who's Ranger Bob?
JUDY=>This is Gary Schweickart. He works with me in the Public Defenders office.
BILLY=>Howdy, Bob.
JUDY=>You don't remember meeting him briefly when you first came in?
BILLY=>That's not a face you forget.
JUDY=>I know that you requested a female attorney, but Gary's the most qualified...
BILLY=>I didn't request nothin'
JUDY=>Well, Billy did.
BILLY=>Billy's asleep.
GARY=>Well, someone did.
BILLY=>Well, someone ain't me.
JUDY=>Who are you?
BILLY=>Tommy.
JUDY=>And have we met before?
BILLY=>Yeah. You came in with one of the headshrinkers.
JUDY=>And at that time you answered to the name Billy?
BILLY=>We all do. Saves time. But that don't mean we like it.
GARY=>Alright... Tommy... we'd like to ask you a few questions. How old are you?
BILLY=>Sixteen.
GARY=>How much time do you spend as Billy? Were you there when he got out of the straitjacket?
BILLY=>Yeah, that was me. Billy couldn't get out of a wet paper bag. I can dislocate my shoulder to slip it down to where I can loosen the ties.
GARY=>Where'd you learn to do that?
JUDY=>Tommy?
BILLY=>You got somethin' else you wanna know or can I leave?
JUDY=>No. Please. How many of you live there with Billy?
JUDY=>More than three? More than five?
BILLY=>I'm not really sure. A lot.
GARY=>Were you there when... whoever you were at the time was arrested?
BILLY=>No. That was Danny.
JUDY=>The little boy.
BILLY=>Danny's the keeper of pain.
GARY=>What does that mean?
BILLY=>College man, Bob? Ivy League?
BILLY=>It means whenever Billy's in any pain, Danny comes onto the spot to take it.
JUDY=>The spot? What's that?
BILLY=>Jesus Christ... it's not my job to answer all these questions. I'm outta here.
JUDY=>No, wait... Tommy...
GARY=>This is what you dragged me here for in the middle of the day?
JUDY=>Wait.
BILLY=>I must apologize for Tommy's impudence. He gets frustrated from being locked up. My name is Arthur. How do you do?
JUDY=>How do you do?
GARY=>Yeah, how are ya...
BILLY=>Well, understandably, I've been better. But Tommy said you have some questions.
JUDY=>Yes. Gary was asking about the arrest.
GARY=>The police found an arsenal of weapons in your apartment.
BILLY=>I have nothing to do with those. The only one permitted to handle guns is Ragen. He's the Keeper of Rage.
GARY=>He used those guns when he kidnapped and raped those three women.
BILLY=>Ragen never raped anyone. He committed the robberies because we were skint, but he denies, absolutely, having anything to do sexually with those women. And of the many things he undoubtedly is, a liar is not among them. All our lives people have accused us of being liars. It's become a point of honor never to tell a falsehood.
JUDY=>But if you don't always volunteer the truth, then that's lying by omission.
BILLY=>Oh come now. As an attorney, you know very well a witness is under no compulsion to volunteer information he hasn't been asked for. You would be the first one to tell a client not to elaborate unless it was in his best interest. But why don't you meet Ragen and ask him yourself?
JUDY=>Isn't Ragen the one who pulled the toilet from the wall and threw it at the guards?
BILLY=>He's learned to control his flow of adrenaline. It gives him unnatural strength. But don't worry -- he won't hurt you. Unless, of course, he feels threatened.
GARY=>Alright... Arthur -- I'd like to meet him.
GARY=>How much education has he had?
JUDY=>Not much. Some high school. D average. I.Q.'s a hundred. He paints, though.
GARY=>Paints?
JUDY=>Portraits, landscapes. He's good.
BILLY=>Who called me a liar?
GARY=>I said the evidence indicated that someone in there raped those three woman.
BILLY=>I admit three robberies near university. But other things you say I do is a lie. And if we go to jail, I'll kill the children. Jail is no place for little ones.
JUDY=>What little ones? There are children there with you?
GARY=>If you killed the little ones... wouldn't that also mean your own death?
BILLY=>We are all different people.
GARY=>But when you get hurt...
BILLY=>I feel nothing.
JUDY=>Because Danny is the Keeper of Pain?
BILLY=>Exactly. Danny is empath.
JUDY=>And Billy knows nothing about you?
BILLY=>He has amnesia. Arthur and I keep him asleep to protect him. Depending on circumstances, either I rule or Arthur does. In prison, I control spot because is dangerous place. As protector, I have complete command. In situations where is no danger, and where intelligence and logic are more important, then Arthur controls spot.
GARY=>Do you know Tommy?
BILLY=>Of course.
GARY=>He mentioned the spot, too. Can you describe to us just what that means. Billy?... Uh...
JUDY=>Ragen.
GARY=>Ragen.
JUDY=>Hello.
JUDY=>Have we met? My name is Judy Stevenson. This is Gary Schweickart. We're your attorneys. Do you have a name?
GARY=>Judy.
GARY=>His eyes.
GARY=>Either he's a multiple, or else he's the greatest liar anybody's ever seen.
JUDY=>Right.
GARY=>The question is which is it?
JUDY=>Gary...
GARY=>He's facing hard time.
JUDY=>He's got one right handed personality.
GARY=>Lots of people are ambidextrous.
JUDY=>Ragen speaks and writes prefect Serbo-Croation.
GARY=>So do ten million Serbs.
JUDY=>Apparently, Arthur's fluent in Arabic and Swahili.
GARY=>Having a facility for languages doesn't automatically make you one hand short for bridge.
JUDY=>The escape artist, the wandering eyes, the electronics expert...
GARY=>All of that can be mastered.
JUDY=>All by one person? With a hundred I.Q.? From a small farm in Ohio? You're looking for some kind of miraculous, inexplicable "thing" to prove this to you beyond a shadow of a doubt. Well, it's an illness, Gary... not a magic trick. And I believe him.
GARY=>I do, too. And I feel like I can convince my wife of it when she asks me why I came down here for fifteen minutes, and came back five hours later. But how in hell am I ever gonna convince a judge? Or a prosecutor? No one's ever been acquitted of a crime before by blaming it on another personality.
JUDY=>You won't have to. He will.
GUARD=>Alright, Milligan. Exercise time.
GUARD=>One hour in the yard, all to yourself.
GUARD=>Come on... Milligan...
GUARD=>Help! We got an emergency! Quick!
GARY=>How ya feelin', Billy? You were out for quite some time.
JUDY=>Do you know where you are? You're in the hospital, but you're gonna be just fine. Your hearing is going to go ahead as scheduled.
GARY=>Well, why don't you get some rest. We'll check in with you tomorrow.
JUDY=>Goodnight, Billy.
JUDY=>What do you think?
GARY=>I don't know. But there were no hammers or crowbars in that cell with him. He broke that sink with his bare fist.
JUDY=>What's wrong?
GARY=>I just found out they're gonna try and send him to jail for a parole violation and keep him there till the trial. We need him in a hospital with doctors for those ninety days to build a case.
JUDY=>Parole violation?
GARY=>But there's a statute of limitations and this is the last day they can nail him on it.
JUDY=>What are you gonna do?
GARY=>Wing it.
CHAIRMAN=>Mr. Yavitch? Shall we begin?
GARY=>Objection, Mr. Chairman.
MR. CHAIRMAN=>Mr. Schweickart -- don't you own a tie?
GARY=>I do, your honor, but I like to save it for funerals.
CHAIRMAN=>What is your objection?
GARY=>Are these the weapons that were found in the defendant's home?
GARY=>Mr. Chairman, Mr. Schweickart does not know damn well that they are because Mr. Schweickart has yet to see any ballistics report.
GARY=>It is "prescient" counsel, because without any proof of it's ability to propel a ballistic, this... "thing" is not a gun, your honor.
JUDGE=>Mr. Schweickart...
GARY=>Legally, until it shoots a bullet it's as much a gun as it is a zucchini. And having zucchinis found in your apartment is not a violation of Mr. Milligan's or anybody else's parole. Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, since the statute of limitations of Mr. Milligan's alleged parole violation is up today. I move that the defendant be allowed to stay at Harding Hospital, under the supervision of a trained psychiatric staff until it is time for him to stand trial.
CHAIRMAN=>So be it. Next time get your shit together, counsel.
CHAIRMAN=>Zucchinis...
NURSE=>Take those off him.
FIRST OFFICER=>Not while he's still ours.
FIRST OFFICER=>Can I give you a little advice? Keep him away from the toilets. Let him piss in a bucket.
NURSE=>Doctor Harding's not here right now, but he'll look in on you as soon as he arrives.
FIRST PSYCH-TECH=>I'm not gonna stand for it.
SECOND PSYCH-TECH=>Jean...
FIRST PSYCH-TECH=>It's a con. It's a lousy con. And I'm not gonna treat him.
PATIENT=>Want some? My folks bring it. Your folks come visit you?
BILLY=>My folks are divorced. Leave me alone.
PATIENT=>What's your name? Come on, what's your name?
BILLY=>Allen.
PATIENT=>Only they call you Billy, right? But that's not your name, is it? I understand.
BILLY=>You do?
PATIENT=>They do that all the time here. Natalie Wood. How do you do?
DOCTOR=>It's got to be a mistake. A glitch in the machine.
TECHNICIAN=>I've never had a problem before.
DOCTOR=>Well, what do you want me to say? Adults do not emit spiked Theta waves on their EEG's. Only children do. Try changing the electrode.
DOCTOR=>See? Completely normal. Those electrodes are for shit.
TECHNICIAN=>But I didn't change the electrode. I had to order it.
NURSE=>I think he's looking forward to meeting you, Doctor.
DR. HARDING=>I'll see him in my office. Lots of coffee, please.
HARDING=>Ah, Billy, come on in. Sit down. Coffee?
HARDING=>Your honor, based on my interviews with the defendant, it is my opinion that, William S. Milligan suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder and has fragmented into ten separate personality manifestations. At the time of the acts in question, I believe he was mentally ill and unable to distinguish between right and wrong. Further, he did not have the ability to refrain from committing these acts. These findings are consistent with a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and I would, therefore, recommend that he be remanded to Athens State Hospital for suitable treatment.
JUDGE=>Mr. Yavitch, do you contest these findings?
JUDGE=>Then, lacking any evidence to the contrary, this court has no alternative than to find the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity.
REPORTER=>How do you feel now that you've been found not guilty?
BILLY=>I feel better now that it's all over with and I finally have come back to a reality that I've missed for so long.
SECOND REPORTER=>Do you have any recollection of the crimes your other personalities have been charged with?
BILLY=>Very little. Certain things come to me in forms of dreams that you could call memories, but I can't really distinct between memories -- the realities...
REPORTER=>Yeah, right. And I'm Doris Day.
BILLY=>... because my emotions split so far apart -- love, hate and fear...
SECOND REPORTER=>Billy, what do you want to do with your life?
BILLY=>Become a citizen again.
FIRST POLICEMAN=>Well, you got away with it, didn't ya? You must be pretty proud of yourself.
FIRST POLICEMAN=>You turn my stomach. I've got two daughters. Come on, you can tell me -- you're fakin', right?
SECOND POLICEMAN=>Ray... You look cold. You want some hot coffee? Here.
ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and gentlemen. The Eden Roc Hotel welcomes you to the Grand Ballroom. Have we got a show for you tonight!
ANNOUNCER=>Claire and Myrna -- the Barry Sisters... The dancing stylings of Tanya and Briaggi... And now, please welcome the adults only comedy of Johnny Morrison.
JOHNNY=>Now you know why it's cheaper here than the Fountainbleu.
JOHNNY=>Two women at the Fountainbleu are looking through a hole in the wall into the men's steam room. They see one poor shnook, naked as a jaybird with a towel over his face. The first woman says: "Ciel... would you look at that? He's not Jewish." The other woman says "Jewish? He's not even a guest here."
JOHNNY=>Alright, already.
BUSBOY=>Goddammit!
BILLY=>I'm sorry.
BUSBOY=>Get out of the goddamn aisle. I been just missin' you all night.
BILLY=>I couldn't see before.
BUSBOY=>Well, that's too bad -- what the hell are you doin' in here all alone, anyway?
BILLY=>That's my Daddy.
BUSBOY=>Yeah? Well, he stinks. That steam room joke is as old as my Aunt Bessie's ass.
BUSBOY=>Now sit someplace else, before I have you thrown out.
BILLY=>No!
SECOND BUSBOY=>Leave him alone.
BUSBOY=>Hey, buddy, I was only...
SECOND BUSBOY=>Just leave him alone.
BILLY=>I couldn't see before. That's my Daddy.
SECOND BUSBOY=>There. Now you see everything.
DOROTHY=>Billy, please -- can't you see I'm tryin' to watch the TV? Now take that someplace else.
DOROTHY=>My God, he looks just like him. I can't look at him. I can't...
WOMAN=>Come on, son. Your Mother's very upset.
WOMAN=>Now you just sit up here and play for a while, alright? That's all grown up stuff goin' on downstairs. And soon your Mama's gonna take you back home with her to Ohio. Won't that be fun?
BILLY=>Wooooo... woooo...
GIRL=>Vrooom... vrooom...
ATTENDANT=>Sorry, he's too little. There's a height requirement.
CHALMER=>Well, tell ya what -- you wait here and we'll meet you right after. It's a short one, this one.
DOROTHY=>Billy, wake up. Look.
DOROTHY=>He asked me to marry him. We're not going to be alone anymore.
BILLY=>I don't know what to call him.
DOROTHY=>Chalmer is your Daddy, now. You call him Daddy Chal.
CHALMER=>What are you doin' in there? Only sissies help their Mama's do dishes. You come in here with me and watch some TV.
DOROTHY=>Go on. He's you Daddy, now. You mind him. He loves you.
DOROTHY=>Billy, would you please pass the salt?
CHALMER=>Salt gets passed clockwise.
BILLY=>What?
CHALMER=>Everything at the table gets passed clockwise.
BILLY=>Why?
CHALMER=>Because that's how we did it when I was growin' up. It learned me manners -- you don't have everybody reachin' all over the table for everything -- gettin' in everybody's food.
DOROTHY=>Thank you.
CHALMER=>It's just like when I taught you to sit with your hands on your knees and your feet flat on the floor when you're not eatin'. And you don't have to know the reason for everything, anyway. If I say to do something, then that's enough. Right?
BILLY=>Yes.
CHALMER=>Yes, what?
BILLY=>Yes, Daddy Chal.
DOROTHY=>Chalmer...
CHALMER=>What...?
DOROTHY=>No...
CHALMER=>Don't tell me no -- we're married now.
DOROTHY=>Billy...
CHALMER=>So?
DOROTHY=>We can go in the bedroom.
CHALMER=>What are you looking at? You bend them eyes while I'm talkin' to you, boy.
DOROTHY=>Is it that late? God, I don't know where the time went.
BILLY=>Hello, Daddy Chal...
DOROTHY=>Billy!
DOROTHY=>Come on to bed!
DOROTHY=>Look what I made for my two men this morning. Pancakes and bacon and fresh squeezed juice...
CHALMER=>We're going to the farm today, Billy. There's a lot to be done.
CHALMER=>Come on...
CHALMER=>Six feet. You hear me?
RAGEN'S VOICE=>Christene...
RAGEN'S VOICE=>Please... don't cry... I get you another apple.
RAGEN=>I will always be here to protect you.
BILLY=>Who is it?
GORDY=>Gordy.
GORDY=>Shit, it's cold. You got any scotch?
GORDY=>What's wrong? We gonna do this in front of the neighbors? I've got the money.
BILLY=>Where are you going?
GORDY=>Where am I going?
BILLY=>Hey.
GORDY=>Whoa. Jackpot.
GORDY=>What's wrong? I showed you the money.
GORDY=>Cool it.
GORDY=>What are you gettin' all excited for? Have I ever ripped you off? Never. Wow, you got the reds.
BILLY=>How did you know this was there?
GORDY=>That's where you always keep 'em. Oh no. Are you gonna get all weird again? I hate when you do this shit.
GORDY=>I didn't know you were so into that stuff.
BILLY=>Put them down.
GORDY=>Boy, who put the bug up your ass today? And what's with the commie accent? You know, the guy I work for is looking for a bodyguard. Someone to drive the car to the pick-ups and look like an animal so no one pulls any shit. You wanna meet him? The pay is good.
BILLY=>How much?
GORDY=>I don't know -- ask him. The sumbitch is made of money. I'm goin' over there now. You wanna come?
BILLY=>We need money.
GORDY=>So come on. His name's Foley.
GORDY=>He wants to talk to you.
BILLY=>It is not good to move. I put three bullets between your eyes before you take step.
BILLY=>You. Take gun from under jacket with two fingers and put on ground.
BILLY=>Do it now or you will be smiling out of your sleeve.
BILLY=>I would say you need better bodyguard than these two.
FOLEY=>Go over there. I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Milligan.
FOLEY=>What do you drink?
BILLY=>Vodka.
FOLEY=>No shit. Where'd you get a name like Milligan?
BILLY=>Names mean nothing. I am Yugoslavian.
FOLEY=>Well, Billy. I'm in the shipping business, and my drivers need protection.
BILLY=>I am a protector. You have job. I do it. I need money.
FOLEY=>Oh, don't worry, you'll make money.
BILLY=>Except one thing. I do not hurt people unless my life is in danger, and I do not harm womans.
FOLEY=>It's a deal.
GORDY=>Where'd you learn karate? Who are you really? Ex-C.I.A.? Mercenary?
GORDY=>You O.K.? Here, you want a B.B.?
BILLY=>Gordy.
GORDY=>Poetry? You read this shit? Or you got a girlfriend I don't know about?
GORDY=>Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all.
BILLY=>I've never seen it before.
GORDY=>No? Then who the hell's it belong to?
DOROTHY=>Billy! you're gonna be late for school!
DOROTHY=>Billy, come on.
DOROTHY=>Let's go. I'm making blueberry pancakes.
DOROTHY=>I'm not going to show this report card to Daddy Chal. One D, all the rest F's... What's wrong, Billy? I know you're bright. You go to school every day. Why don't you learn? It's like there's two Billy's. And one of them I don't care for very much at all. Now you're going to have to try and do better, and that's all there is to it. Understand?
BILLY=>Do you have any black coffee?
GIRL=>That's my seat.
BILLY=>Go to hell.
GIRL=>Miss Haworth, Billy Milligan just swore at me and he's sitting in my seat.
BILLY=>Jesus...
MISS HAWORTH=>What's the matter, Billy? Don't you remember where your seat it?
MISS HAWORTH=>I'm getting very tired of this little game, Billy. Now take your seat.
MISS HAWORTH=>Thank you. Now maybe we can get on with our arithmetic test.
MISS HAWORTH=>Alright class, you may begin.
ARTHUR=>Oh, dear, really. You must be joking.
MISS HAWORTH=>Ssh!
MISS HAWORTH=>Done already?
MISS HAWORTH=>Aren't you even going to check your work?
MISS HAWORTH=>Let me see your arms.
BILLY=>What's wrong?
MISS HAWORTH=>They're all correct.
PHIL=>Hey.
BILLY=>What are you doing?
BILLY=>Bustin' windows.
PHIL=>Cool. Let me.
BILLY=>Where are you?
PHIL=>Where are you?
BILLY=>I'm standing on the hill -- behind the school.
PHIL=>Yeah? Me too.
KEVIN=>What's your name?
PHIL=>Philip, what's yours?
KEVIN=>Kevin.
PHIL=>That's a funny name.
KEVIN=>Yeah? I'd bust you if I could see you.
PHIL=>Where ya live?
BILLY=>On Spring Street. Where you from?
PHIL=>I'm from Brooklyn, New York, but now I live on Spring Street, too.
KEVIN=>It's 933 Spring. A white house. Owned by some guy named Chalmer Milligan. He calls me Billy.
BILLY=>Jeez -- that's where I live. I know the same guy. He calls me Billy, too. I play along for the pancakes.
PHIL=>I ain't never seen you there.
KEVIN=>I ain't never seen you there, either.
PHIL=>Well, shit, pal, let's go down to the woods and light fires.
KEVIN=>Cool.
BILLY=>L.S.D. Kevin and Philip have become undesirables. Something must be done to banish them from the spot.
ARTHUR'S VOICE=>Ragen Vadascovinich.
RAGEN=>Where are you?
ARTHUR'S VOICE=>I'm right here.
BILLY=>We are in the same body. We share it. You are in my head and I am in yours. And there are others as well, but most of them don't know about each other.
RAGEN=>Is true -- I have heard voices before -- but how can you be same place I am? Is not possible.
ARTHUR=>It's simple, really. Whoever is on the spot holds the consciousness. Right now, it's you. When it's someone else, we are very often unaware.
ARTHUR=>Do you play chess?
RAGEN=>Of course.
ARTHUR=>If we are to survive in the world, we will have to bring some order out of this chaos. Billy wanders around, oblivious, starting things and not finishing them -- getting into all kinds of ridiculous scrapes -- switching in front of people. And some, like Philip and Kevin are quite destructive and need to be carefully monitored.
ARTHUR=>Ah, an Indian defense. Very good.
RAGEN=>Who is that?
ARTHUR=>That is Shawn. He's completely deaf. He takes the spot to block out his mother's cries. We've got all kinds here. But there's got to be a way of controlling things.
RAGEN=>Does Billy know about us?
ARTHUR=>No.
RAGEN=>Should he be told?
ARTHUR=>I think it would drive him insane.
RAGEN=>Then how can things be controlled?
ARTHUR=>We'll make rules. Everyone will have specific duties that are tailored toward their particular talents. Tommy is an electronics genius, as well as an escape artist. Several of us are painters. I excel at foreign languages and dabble in medicine and biochemistry. The girls do domestic chores.
RAGEN=>There are women here?
ARTHUR=>Oh yes. April and Adalana. They do the cooking, the shopping, the cleaning... checkmate.
RAGEN=>What about me?
ARTHUR=>You shall continue your role as protector...
ARTHUR=>... developing yourself physically... learning the martial arts -- weaponry -- being able to step into a dangerous situation at a moments notice.
TEACHER=>The War of the Roses was a series of wars fought by two English families in the late 15th Century for the rule of the country.
TEACHER=>The House of Lancaster had a red rose as its emblem while the House of York had a white rose. The forces of the House of Lancaster won and their leader, Henry Tudor, father of the future Henry VII, became king...
COUNSELOR=>Do you know why you're here, Billy? Do you want to talk about it?
COUNSELOR=>You can say anything here. Go on. What are your feelings?
BILLY=>It's like a dream that comes and goes. My step-dad hates me. I hear him screaming. I hear other voices, too. I get blamed for stuff I didn't do. People call me a liar. I never know what time it is -- or what day it is. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. I don't know what's in my pockets. And I see lots of things that aren't real. There's a locked door and someone's pounding to get out. I see a woman falling down and suddenly she's turning into a pile of metal and I can't reach her and I'm so scared and lonely and I'm afraid to ask for help. I need help. Oh God... Hey, I'm the only kid who can take a trip without LSD.
COUNSELOR=>It's all right, Billy. We're going to get you some help.
DOCTOR=>Ears normal, eyes normal, throat O.K. -- I don't see anything yet. Alright, Billy, take off your pants.
DOROTHY=>Go on, Billy, you mind the doctor.
BILLY=>Nooo!!!
DOCTOR=>Don't worry, Billy. No one's going to hurt you. We're here to help you.
DOCTOR=>He certainly seems high strung, and his mood swings are unpredictable. He also likes to pretend or role play quite a bit. But I don't really see that there's anything more we can do for him here. Try changing his diet. He seems to do better on Jello day.
GIRL=>Billy Milligan is a psycho! He was in the loony bin!
RAGEN'S VOICE=>We must do something. We must act now.
ARTHUR'S VOICE=>Push him off the spot or he'll jump.
TOMMY'S VOICE=>Oh let him jump. Who needs him around, anyway? Always embarrassing us -- always getting us into trouble...
ARTHUR'S VOICE=>No. It's our responsibility to keep him safe.
RAGEN'S VOICE=>Take spot. Quickly.
ARTHUR'S VOICE=>I can't.
TOMMY'S VOICE=>The hell with him. Loser...
RAGEN'S VOICE=>No!
RAGEN=>We must put him to sleep, is too dangerous otherwise.
ARTHUR=>I agree. He can no longer function for himself. He shall relinquish the spot indefinitely. Even if it means he never wakes up again.
RAGEN=>Ssh. Billy is sleeping.
WORKER=>Power off! Power off!
WORKER=>Milligan!
FOREMAN=>What the hell is wrong with you?
FOREMAN=>Don't you hear him? Billy? Knock knock...
FOREMAN=>What's going on?
BILLY=>Nothin', Ted. We got a problem?
FOREMAN=>Yeah, we got a problem. I got a train wreck over there and you're sittin' here pullin' your pud. You do good work when you do it, but I can't run my factory at your convenience.
BILLY=>What are you talkin' about? Hey, Willie, you got a traffic jam?
FOREMAN=>I'm sorry, Billy. You have to leave.
BILLY=>What?
FOREMAN=>You're fired.
BILLY=>Fired?
FOREMAN=>Come up front. I'll pay you off for the week.
CASHIER=>That's $2.85, please.
FRANCINE=>You O.K.?
BILLY=>Yeah, fine.
FRANCINE=>I kept sayin' "Billy". Did you hear me?
BILLY=>I was just thinking. Sorry.
FRANCINE=>What about? Somethin' I made you think about?
BILLY=>Uh... who's party is this?
FRANCINE=>I know, me too. I know he works at the same plant as my friend Liz. But she told me you used to work there, too.
BILLY=>I, uh... I'm embarrassed. I forgot your name.
FRANCINE=>I didn't tell you yet. It's Francine... And I know you're Billy. I asked Liz right when I came in and seen ya. God, that must sound so slutty.
BILLY=>I like girls to be a little slutty.
FRANCINE=>I bet you do.
BILLY=>I don't like the stuck up kind.
FRANCINE=>I know -- me either. Walkin' around all perfect like they don't have no dark part. But you know they do, 'cause everybody does. That's my favorite part -- the dark part. How about you?
BILLY=>I don't know. I guess I've never run into it.
FRANCINE=>Sure you have. People just don't like you knowin' that's what you ran into. Hey, do that trick with your eyes again.
BILLY=>What trick?
FRANCINE=>Where you make your eyes go funny.
BILLY=>How much have you had to drink?
FRANCINE=>Me? What about you?
FRANCINE=>One minute you're fallin' down drunk, the next you're sober. You gotta teach me that one. So, are we going to your place?
FRANCINE=>You said you'd show me your paintings. Come on, I wanna see 'em. I'll just say goodnight to Liz.
FRANCINE=>Are you O.K. to drive? You downed at least two sixes that I saw.
FRANCINE=>Huh? Are you O.K.?
BILLY=>I'm perfectly fine.
FRANCINE=>Oh, well then, home, William.
FRANCINE=>You're on the wrong side of the road!
FRANCINE=>Hey, you're really good. I mean it. The trees look like trees -- the people look like people... I couldn't do that.
BILLY=>Thanks.
FRANCINE=>You sure must like kids.
BILLY=>Kids are very important. But you have to be careful how you paint them -- they're so easy to mess up...
BILLY=>What are you doing in there?
FRANCINE=>I got cold. I was looking for pajamas or a sweater.
BILLY=>What happened? Last thing I remember we laid down on the bed -- did I fall asleep for a minute?
FRANCINE=>A minute? It's almost dawn. Come on back to bed.
FRANCINE=>You're not tired, are you? Once just ain't enough for me tonight.
BILLY=>She spent the night. Bloody hell.
BILLY=>Roy. Leaky.
DECKER=>Yeah?
GUY=>Hey, Billy. Long time, no see...
BILLY=>I do not like this.
GORDY=>Calm down.
BILLY=>They are early.
GORDY=>So they're early. The merchandise won't have a chance to get stale.
GORDY=>Go on. Take the stash bag.
CONNECTION=>Well, well. The Russky.
CONNECTION=>Sticky. Green. Good. Bring out the rest.
BILLY=>Where are the guns?
BILLY=>Bring over here.
CONNECTION=>Dope first.
BILLY=>No.
CONNECTION=>Look man, we're cuttin' you a ridiculous deal as it is.
CONNECTION=>You take advantage of my good nature and I'm gonna take my toys and go home.
BILLY=>We do not do business.
BILLY=>It's getting harder and harder to keep control. The mix-up times are happening far too frequently. The undesirable personalities have been stealing. And today I found this.
BILLY=>Someone is doing drugs. No one can hold a job.
BILLY=>It's all slipping away...
FRANCINE=>Why do you keep throwing out my tampons? My toothbrush and my hairspray, too. You know, if you don't want me to keep stuff here, just tell me.
FOREMAN=>What do you call this?
FOREMAN=>My six year old could put this together. Go home, Milligan. You're fired.
FRANCINE=>I don't understand it. You're so gentle when you make love.
TRANSVESTITE=>Hey sweetheart, got somethin' there for me?
TRANSVESTITE=>You bastard! I'll cut your heart out, motherfucker!
BILLY=>He will live. I am very careful about what bones I break.
SECOND MAN=>No... please...
BILLY=>The jacket.
BILLY=>Don't breath a word, you hear me? You hear me?
SECOND MAN=>Yes...
BILLY=>I know where you live, now.
BILLY=>What the fuck...?
GRILLI=>Grilli's Heros.
BILLY=>What's going on? I bought a Stromboli hero and when I got it home it was all mangled.
BILLY=>It looks like it's been put through a blender. You son of a bitch, you just lost yourself a customer.
GRILLI=>Ohio, man. Must be something in the water...
BILLY=>Hey, Boy. What are you doin' here all alone? C'mere.
BILLY=>What are you lookin' at me like that for? What's wrong? Come here.
BILLY=>Crazy mutt...
BILLY=>Help me. He's been hit by a car. I found him by the side of the road...
NURSE=>Sir, you can't bring him in here -- this is a medical hospital. We'll call the veterinary hospital.
BILLY=>He's not gonna make it to a vet.
NURSE=>We'll send him in an ambulance. There's nothing we can do.
BILLY=>What the fuck is wrong with you? He's a living creature!
NURSE=>Call security.
BILLY=>Fuck security.
DOCTOR=>O.K., why don't you just settle down. You've had a lot to drink.
BILLY=>Somebody help me! Anybody!
BILLY=>Go away!
FRANCINE=>Billy, what have you done?! There's blood everywhere -- my God, Billy!
BILLY=>Get the hell out of here and don't say a word to anybody.
FRANCINE=>What's happening to you? I wake up scared every day. Billy, I don't know if you're gonna be sweet or act crazy or sit and stare at the wall -- and I don't know if it's my fault or what I did wrong. Tell me -- I can fix it. Please...
FRANCINE=>I know you have guns, Billy. You don't have to hide them. I want to know where you've been getting all this money from? New watches, new clothes -- you haven't held a job steady in six months! Billy... Billy...
ARTHUR=>It's time to break this off once and for all.
ALLEN=>No.
TOMMY=>Where did all the blood come from?
RAGEN=>You were supposed to dominate spot. Is your fault.
ARTHUR=>I'm trying -- I can't keep control. The others steal time and I can't stop them.
PHIL=>So what? Would ya listen to him? He thinks he shits crumpets.
KEVIN=>If we all listened to you we'd be sitting with our thumbs up our asses.
ARTHUR=>There must be some code, some kind of order.
RAGEN=>I agree.
ARTHUR=>We must re-group. And the first step is to eliminate her.
ALLEN=>You can't. I won't let you.
ARTHUR=>You've nothing to say about it.
ADALANA=>It's not fair. You can't shut out the only love we have. No one else touches us. Feelings matter more than staying in control. They matter more than anything.
PHIL=>Shut up.
ADALANA=>Without love we'll die.
FRANCINE=>Billy... Billy, come on...
FRANCINE=>Billy... you're scaring me...
RAGEN=>You know rules! Only I touch guns!
BILLY=>Things have gone too far. I take control from now on. No, that's not the solution...
BILLY=>Give me the gun! Give me the gun!
WOMAN=>Fifty four years old, my first time on a plane... can you believe it? My daughter finally got me a ticket. She says let me do something for you. I said if you really wanna do something for me, stop seeing that musician who gave your dog angina. The truth. He played that damn guitar so loud, he killed the dog. If I gave you her number, would you call her? I'm gonna write it down. Is this you first time going to England?
BILLY=>Madam, it's my home.
BILLY=>Cheerio, wot.
BILLY=>The decline of the empire can be directly linked to disastrous labor policies since the war. Misguided attempts to withdraw from colonization in Africa left a void not only economically, but in the national psyche. We must bring the conservatives back to power immediately.
BILLY=>I've obviously returned just in time.
BILLY=>Earth has not anything to show more fair Dull would he be of soul who could pass by A sight so touching in its majesty The city now doth, like a garment, wear The beauty of the morning...
BILLY=>Well...
PROPRIETOR=>Bit of breakfast, then, gov'ner? It's included...
BILLY=>What's going on? What the hell am I doing here? What's wrong with me?
BILLY=>What's wrong with me? I want to die... please, God, let me die...
FIRST OFFICIAL=>No passport, no money, no ticket home...
SECOND OFFICIAL=>That's not clever, is it?
FIRST OFFICIAL=>Bloody Americans -- think they own the world.
APRIL=>It's all your fault. Everything. Our whole life is ruined and it's all because of him. He has to pay for what he's done to us. He has to die. There are ways. Things we can do to him...
APRIL=>We could burn his body -- bit by bit -- so he'd never be able to hurt anyone again. The heat would cauterize his wounds as we went, so there would be no blood.
APRIL=>We'd keep him awake with amphetamines, so that he'd suffer here on Earth -- before he went to hell.
APRIL=>Don't forget what he did to the children. To Christene... He has to be stopped. He has to die.
ARTHUR=>What are you doing?
ARTHUR=>You can't kill him. They'll send us to jail -- including the children. How do you expect them to survive in prison?
RAGEN=>I will protect them. He must be stopped so he can never hurt children again.
ARTHUR=>Killing is wrong. We only protect ourselves if we are threatened.
APRIL=>What about what he did to us? We'll never be able to get on with our lives as long as we know he's somewhere out there. We'll never feel safe.
ARTHUR=>Ragen...
CHRISTENE=>Please don't hurt him.
CHRISTENE=>Ragen, I'm scared. I don't want anymore nightmares.
ARTHUR=>If we kill him, then they were all right. We're crazy. And we will never get better.
CHRISTENE=>Please...
BILLY=>The money is gone. The bills have not been paid.
RAGEN=>The trip to London leaves us broke. Now we are evicted. Something must be done.
PHIL=>We can't hold a job. We can't count on Billy to do anything. We're starving. There's only one way for us to make any money.
KEVIN=>You don't have to hurt anyone -- just force some guy to cash a check.
CHRISTENE=>I'm hungry.
BILLY=>I do not rob womans.
ADALANA=>Would you please get in the car?
DONNA=>Where are we going?
DONNA=>I know this is gonna sound ridiculous, but I have an optometry test today.
ADALANA=>You can study for it if you want. This won't take long. Go on.
ALLEN=>What's going on? Does Arthur know about this?
KEVIN=>I'm taking these addresses and phone numbers. If you say anything to the police, I'll send someone from my brotherhood after you.
FIRST WOMAN=>Kidnapped her right out of the parking lot.
SECOND WOMAN=>My God. Black fella or white?
FIRST WOMAN=>Black, I think.
CASHIER=>My daughter goes to that school.
BILLY=>Thank you.
PHIL=>Shut up, faggot.
KEVIN=>Yeah. Go paint a picture.
ALLEN=>This is a bad mix-up time. Arthur should be controlling the spot. Or Ragen if you're going to rob somebody. Where is Ragen?
PHIL=>Take off your pants.
CARRIE=>What?
PHIL=>Take your fucking pants off!
PHIL=>You won't run away without any pants on.
ADALANA=>Don't hurt her.
KEVIN=>Shut up.
ADALANA=>I have to hold the spot. Please.
KEVIN=>Fuck you.
BILLY=>Are you cold?
BILLY=>Take off your underwear and lay down.
PHIL=>That fucking bitch.
BILLY=>Dammit! Someone is spending all money on drugs! Arthur!
RAGEN=>Arthur!
BILLY=>Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all And sweetest in the gale is heard And sore must be the storm That could abash the little bird That kept so many warm I've heard it in the chilliest land And on the strangest sea Yet never in extremity It asked a crumb of me
ADALANA=>Do you know what it's like to be lonely? Not to be held by anyone? Not to know the meaning of love?
ADALANA=>I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances. I really love you.
PHIL=>Alright, that's enough. Let's get the check cashed.
TOMMY=>What the fuck?
TOMMY=>So, I apologize for forgettin' your name -- I haven't been out on a date in a while... you have enough food? You want somethin' else?
PHIL=>Come on.
YOUNG OFFICER=>You Billy Milligan?
DANNY=>Who?
YOUNG OFFICER=>Where are they?
DANNY=>Who? There's no one here.
SECOND GUARD=>They sent you down some Kool-Aid. You want it?
SECOND GUARD=>Is that a no?
SECOND GUARD=>Hey, you think we oughta tattoo this Jew Boy?
FIRST GUARD=>Yeah. Put some numbers right there.
SECOND GUARD=>Here ya go, Rembrandt.
GUARD=>O.K. rapist, chow time. We all took turns spitting on your food before I brought it down, but you can ignore that, can't ya? just pretend it's soup...
GUARD=>Jesus H. Christ...
RAGEN=>February 14th. Is twenty first birthday. I think it is time to wake him.
ARTHUR=>Absolutely not. He can't handle it.
RAGEN=>In jail I control spot. Is time.
BILLY=>I thought I was dead. I though...
BILLY=>My God -- sweet Jesus Christ.
BILLY=>What's happening?!!
GARY=>How ya feeling, Billy? You were out for quite some time.
DOCTOR=>See? Completely normal. Those electrodes are for shit.
TECHNICIAN=>But I didn't change the electrodes. I had to order it.
JUDGE=>Lacking any evidence to the contrary, this court has no alternative than to find the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity.
ROSALIE=>You're awfully quiet today, Allen. I almost thought it was Danny sitting out here, till I saw the brush in your right hand. Allen?
ROSALIE=>Oh my God.
BILLY=>I'm Billy.
CAUL=>Good afternoon, Billy. How are you feeling today?
BILLY=>Fine, thanks, Dr. Caul. How are you?
CAUL=>I'm just fine. Now, you've been responding so well to the Amitol, that I've talked with Arthur and Ragen and the others, and we all feel that you're ready for this.
BILLY=>Yes.
CAUL=>Alright then.
BILLY=>You have made quite a few enemies, Dr. Caul. I'm not one of your enemies, at the moment. It is Arthur.
DR. CAUL=>Why?
BILLY=>The things that Arthur was keeping secret was exposed, the other day. There was penetration by the undesirables.
DR. CAUL=>Explain the undesirables. We need to understand that.
BILLY=>The undesirables are people who was silenced by Arthur because their functions were no longer necessary -- um -- for a multitude of reasons they were silenced.
DR. CAUL=>Then why are they still around?
BILLY=>What do you want us to do? Murder them?
BILLY=>It gets frustratin' 'cause people keep callin' ya Billy and you don't pay attention and then, finally, you're like: oh yeah, I'm Billy. But I'm not Billy. I'm Tommy.
DR. CAUL=>How did you learn Arabic? How did Ragen learn Serbo-Croation? Or Tommy electronics and escape artistry...?
BILLY=>Different ways. Books. The library. By doing. Everyone has a special job, special abilities -- and it is each person's responsibility to develop them.
DR. CAUL=>That's Allen. He's the only one who smokes. He's also the only one who's right handed. At the time of the trial, we thought there were only ten of you, because Arthur had already banished the undesirables by that point.
BILLY=>Yeah. Philip, Kevin, April, Adalana -- he kicked a whole bunch out when everything happened.
DR. CAUL=>So then, how many of you are there all together?
BILLY=>Twenty three.
DR. CAUL=>Twenty three. Plus Billy?
BILLY=>Plus Billy.
DR. CAUL=>What about Adalana? She's a female.
BILLY=>You must understand that Billy associates any type of male sexuality with abuse and torture. Just as Tommy can get out of ropes and Ragen can protect himself physically. Adalana was created to make and seek love.
ANCHORWOMAN=>In the ten months he's been at the Athens Mental Health Center, campus rapist Billy Milligan has been described by doctors as a model patient who has made enormous progress and even started the Foundation Against Child Abuse with money earned from the sale of his paintings. But there is a new controversy swirling around him today.
MOLINARO=>It has come to our attention that Billy Milligan's doctors have been letting him take unsupervised trips from the hospital into town as part of his therapy. This is completely unacceptable! I have today called Judge Kinworthy to sign a court order sending Milligan away to the maximum security facility at Lima, where he'll never again be allowed to roam freely in the community!
GARY=>What?!
GARY=>Is it true? Have you been letting him out of the hospital?
DR. CAUL=>Yes.
GARY=>Alone?
DR. CAUL=>He has a treatable illness, Mr. Schweickart. And ultimately, the point of any treatment is to make the patient well enough to be discharged.
GARY=>But is he ready?
DR. CAUL=>Yes. He's met all of his personalities and is finally becoming one Billy. He's no longer a danger to himself or anybody else. And you can take that to the bank.
GARY=>Where is he now?
DR. CAUL=>Upstairs. But it's crucial he not be sent to Lima. It's a snake pit. He'll revert completely. All the work we've done here will be lost.
GARY=>It's an election year. This Molinaro guy has 'em all whipped up into a frenzy. The National Organization of Women, the National Lesbian Coalition...
DR. CAUL=>A little boy is repeatedly sodomized and tortured for a period of years. In order to survive, he fragments his personality -- because he is trying desperately to gain some kind of control over what for him is an unfathomable situation. That's a basic human response, Mr. Schweickart. No matter how unusual the route he chose, since the dawn of time, when man can't control his reality, he makes up someone who can. It's why we created God. Ragen, Arthur, Adalana -- they were Billy's God's -- and, like God, they demanded terrible sacrifices. He couldn't stop worshiping them when they demanded he break the law.
AIDE=>I'm grabbing some lunch. You have to babysit.
AIDE=>See you in an hour.
NURSE=>But...
GARY=>Sorry.
NURSE=>You startled me.
GARY=>I'm Billy's defense attorney. Dr. Caul said it'd be alright if I talked to him alone...
GARY=>... for awhile. Hey, Billy.
GARY=>Long time no see.
BILLY=>I'm sorry. I don't know who you are.
GARY=>Gary Schweickart. I'm your lawyer. I'm here to help.
BILLY=>I apologize. I don't remember a lot of people I've met.
GARY=>That's O.K. I'm meeting you now. This is kind of a morbid place to take a walk, isn't it?
BILLY=>This is where I come sometimes to try and sort things out. When you don't have any family or a friend in the world and nobody gives a damn and you die here, all your records are destroyed. But they keep a list of who's buried where so that in case some long, lost relative shows up they can say "Oh yeah, he's number forty one." That's what happens to you if you're sick. If you're the black sheep.
GARY=>How's therapy going?
BILLY=>Good. Last week in group therapy they had another multiple there. That was a crowded room.
BILLY=>They're gonna send me to Lima, aren't they?
GARY=>Not necessarily.
BILLY=>I'll die there.
GARY=>There's going to be a hearing and you're going to get to finally tell your side of the story.
BILLY=>No one believes that I'm sick.
GARY=>They will. Unless they believe that a little boy who was placed in a mental hospital when he was fourteen for acting like different people was really planning his defense eight years in advance.
BILLY=>Why are you helping me?
GARY=>'Cause you deserve it.
CHALMER=>I, Chalmer Milligan, have been accused by my adopted son, William, of threatening, abusing and sodomizing him, particularly over the period when he was eight or nine years old. This accusation is completely false. William is a habitual liar, and I feel that he is continuing a pattern of lying which he established many years ago. These accusations have caused me extreme embarrassment, mental anguish and suffering, and I make this statement in order to set the record straight and clear my good name.
JUDY=>Don't listen to them. They just believe what they read in the papers.
NURSE=>Billy? You have a visitor.
JUDY=>I'll wait outside.
DOROTHY=>Hello, Billy. You look fine. People sure are talkin' about you. You're a regular celebrity. Billy, I...
BILLY=>It's all right, Mama. You went through it, too. When I close my eyes and picture you -- it's with a bloody mouth and black eyes and half the hair pulled out of your head.
BILLY=>But I can't help you with your guilt. Don't ask me to.
JUDY=>Are you alright? I'm Judy Stephenson. I work in the Public Defender's office.
DOROTHY=>How do you do. I'm sorry...
JUDY=>Don't be silly. But Mrs. Moore, I wonder if I could talk to you a moment?
DOROTHY=>Yes?
JUDY=>The statements your ex-husband has made -- we have to know -- are they true? Did Billy make it all up?
DOROTHY=>I've made my statement. I wouldn't have any way of knowing the extent...
JUDY=>Please. Off the record.
DOROTHY=>This is Chalmer Milligan. And this. And this. He destroyed that little boy. And I didn't stop him.
WIFE=>Wearing a suit, huh? You must be worried.
GARY=>Piece of cake.
DAUGHTER=>Daddy, you match.
JUDY=>See the paper this morning? People believe Chalmer's story.
GARY=>They also once thought you could get the clap from toilet seats.
JUDY=>You can't?
MOLINARO=>Gary. Judy.
GARY=>Dick.
MOLINARO=>You know Mr. Banks.
GARY=>You send him to Lima and you're gonna kill him.
BANKS=>Lima's a mental health facility, not death row.
GARY=>It's a butcher shop. Dr. Caul talks about medical conditions and sacrificing Gods... you know what I see? I see a little kid who had no way out, so he created a bunch of comic book heroes. The Justice League of America. The escape artist, the Yugoslavian hitman...
MOLINARO=>The rapist.
GARY=>No one wants to make him a saint -- we just don't want to execute a guy who wasn't even there at the scene of the crimes.
MOLINARO=>I know you, Schweickart. You don't think you're on the right side unless you feel like the underdog. Well, this time your compassion is misplaced. Try thinking about the victims. Try thinking about their families. I'm gonna stop you, Gary. And I'm not gonna lose a night's sleep afterwards.
GARY=>Have you ever been to Lima?
BILLY=>Yes. For a week.
GARY=>And when you were there, did you receive hypnotherapy?
BILLY=>No.
GARY=>Group therapy?
BILLY=>No.
GARY=>Art therapy?
BILLY=>No.
GARY=>Do you have any confidence in your doctor there, Dr. Milkie?
BILLY=>No. He doesn't believe I'm sick. He gave me Stelazine. It messed me up.
GARY=>Billy, before you were arrested and Dr. Caul started treating you, did you ever suspect that there was anything wrong with you?
BILLY=>Sure. I knew I lost time and heard voices in my head, but I thought that happened to everybody.
GARY=>Didn't you think it strange that no one talked about it?
BILLY=>I was so scared and embarrassed, I figured everyone else was, too. Then, every once in a while, I'd hear someone say "I don't know where the day went" or "Did I have fun last night?". I thought that was as close as anybody came to discussing it.
GARY=>And how do you feel now, after ten months at Athens?
BILLY=>Well, I feel whole, like I'm one person for the first time in my life. I used to feel like a freak. But then I got to thinkin' -- in my life, I've learned to get out of handcuffs and straitjackets, be a righty or a lefty, control if I'm drunk or sober, talk Arabic, Hebrew, Yugoslavian, Japanese, learn martial arts, play piano and drums, make my eye shake, be an artist... And, I'm no rocket scientist... my I.Q. is pretty average -- so I got to thinkin' if I could do all that, then couldn't everybody? They just don't know how to tap into it. But if they have a brain, just like I have a brain -- and it's made up of the same muscle and stuff that mine is, then maybe, just maybe, if they went through what I went through as a kid, they might have split up into a bunch of different people like I did. And then I didn't feel like such a freak. I felt like someone who got forced to open a door everybody else gets to keep locked. I felt like that but for the grace of God go there. I don't want to hurt anybody ever again, your honor. I can't get out of bed in the morning knowing what I've done. But I want to keep getting better. And I know that won't happen if you send me to Lima.
BANKS=>Multiple Personality Disorder is a form of narcissism. A willful disease. Cowardly. It is the five year old child with powdered sugar on his lips saying "I didn't eat the last doughnut."
BANKS=>You have already heard the testimony from his psychiatric resident at Lima State Hospital, Dr. Frederick Milkie, who, after examining the defendant, concluded not only that he did not suffer from M.P.D., but that in all probability, the disorder itself does not exist. The defense has certainly offered no physiological evidence to the contrary. Only differing professional opinion. But, your honor, the validity of Mr. Milligan's psychiatric claims is not at issue here. What is at issue is the safety of this community from a convicted sex offender.
GARY=>That's a lie. He was acquitted.
BANKS=>You're absolutely right, counsel, and I apologize. He was acquitted -- by reason of insanity. Insanity, your honor. Insanity which made Billy Milligan strap on a Smith & Wesson, jog to the Ohio State University campus, on not one, not two, but three separate occasions, abduct a young woman, drive her to a secluded area in the woods and rape her. And now, Dr. Caul and his staff want to allow this man, who is, by his own admission and by the court's edict, insane, to roam freely and unsupervised through the streets of this city. Well, your honor, if this man is well and not serving very hard time, then there has been a gross miscarriage of justice. But if he is truly insane, and not responsible for his actions at the time of the crimes, then send him to Lima, where this community can rest assured he will not be allowed to walk the streets and do yet more irreparable damage. When you break a teacup, you glue it back together. But do you ever feel safe using it again? No. You put it away in the cupboard and close the door. Your honor, there's a lot more at stake here than just being scalded by some hot water.
JUDY=>Jesus Christ.
JUDGE=>Mr. Schweickart, are you ready with your summation?
GARY=>Your honor, the prosecution is right. There is more at stake here than just being scalded by some hot water. There's also a hell of a lot more at stake than a cracked teacup. There's a human life. One that's been robbed of every chance at normalcy from the age of eight by vicious and relentless child abuse. Faust made a pact with the devil. Well, Billy Milligan made a pact, too. But he did it to survive. Something inside his eight year old mind said "I can't fight this man who adopts me, then rapes me. Who tells me to call him Daddy, then buries me alive with just a metal pipe over my face for air. And then urinates down the pipe. I can't protect myself -- and neither can my mother. And I'm too afraid to tell the police. Or a teacher. Because if I do, he'll kill me. So I'll go to sleep. And I'll let someone else take over my mind and my body to protect me. And they can escape out of the ropes when he ties me up. And they can defend me. And outsmart him. And take the pain so I don't kill myself just to make it stop." The only problem was, the personalities didn't conveniently go away when he grew up and no longer needed them. They stayed. And in order to fight fire with fire, some of those personalities had learned to be as angry and destructive as their tormentor. And finally one of those personalities was a part of him who needed and demanded love. And her name was Adalana. And three times, last October, in the woods outside Columbus, she took it. By force. The devil had finally come with the bill. You've heard Dr. Caul and Dr. Harding both testify that Multiple Personality Disorder not only does exist, but that it's symptoms cannot be faked. Amnesiatic fugue states cannot be faked. Nystagmus cannot be faked. And you've also heard them say that he's no longer a threat to himself or anybody else, but that if he's sent to Lima, where he will be given drugs instead of therapy, Billy will almost certainly re-fragment, and destroy all the remarkable progress he's made since coming to Athens. And although the prosecution has made a lot of the fact that Billy's doctors see it as essential to his recovery that he be allowed furloughs off of hospital grounds and into the city, there is a fundamental issue not being addressed here -- and that is the fact that Billy Milligan is not a criminal. The court decided that when he was found not guilty. And they were right to do so, We all like to think of ourselves as compassionate and caring human beings and yet as soon as that compassion threatens to demand something real from us -- a demonstration -- proof of its existence -- we draw the line. Please, your honor, let's use this opportunity to take one small step in narrowing the gap between our potential for compassion and the reality of its limits. If I have an incurable disease, and I don't know it, and I give it to you, and you die -- can I to be tried as a murderer? No. I didn't know I was sick. So you decide to quarantine me instead, which is only sensible, since we don't want me to hurt anyone else. But, if I'm then cured to the point where I'm no longer contagious... do you never let me out again? Billy Milligan has been fighting for his life since he was eight years old, your honor. Now that he's finally got a piece of it back -- please don't take it away from him.
BAILIFF=>The Judge is ready.
JUDGE=>The court finds that the respondent, due to his mental illness, is dangerous to himself and to others and requires hospitalization in a maximum security facility. It is ordered, therefore, that the respondent, William Stanley Milligan, be committed to the Lima State Hospital in Lima, Ohio.
GARY=>I'm gonna get you out. I swear to God.
INTERVIEWER=>Do you have any comment, Mr. Molinaro?
MOLINARO=>Yeah, I have a comment. What took them so long?
COP=>We got you now, motherfucker.
BILLY=>Dear Gary, Billy is asleep. Something very bad is happening but I don't know what. The doctors say bad things about us and what hurts most is they are right.
BILLY=>We, I, am a freak, a misfit, a biological error. We all hate this place, but it's where we belong.
COP=>Welcome to Hell.
BILLY=>Ragen is stopping everything for good. He has to. He says if you do not speak, you do no damage to anyone on the outside or the inside. No one can blame us for anything.
BILLY=>The span of attention will be turned inward and it will enforce the total block. By shutting out the real world, we can live peacefully in ours. We know that a world without pain is a world without feeling... but a world without feeling is a world without pain.
BILLY=>When I'm not asleep and not on the spot, it's like I'm lying face down on a street of glass that stretches out forever and I can look down through it. Beyond that, in the farthest ground, it seems like stars of outer space, but then there's a circle. A beam of light.
BILLY=>It's almost as if it's coming out of my eyes because it's always in front of me. Around it, some of my people are lying in coffins.
BILLY=>The lids aren't on them because they're not dead yet.
DOCTOR=>I rebuke you demons, in the name of the savior, Jesus Christ! Leave this wretched soul!
BILLY=>They're asleep, waiting for something. There are some empty coffins because not everyone has come there yet.
BILLY=>Danny and the other young ones want a chance at life. The older ones have given up hope.
BILLY=>Danny named this place because he made it.
BILLY=>He calls it "The Dying Place".
