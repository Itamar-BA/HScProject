NELL=>Come, Poll, do you know my friend, Lord Mortimer? ) Lord Mortimer — Lord Mortimer —
PARROT=>Lord Mortimer is like a pig. His brain's small and his belly big.
MILORD=>What's this hub-bub?
FOOTMAN=>One of the lunatics from the asylum, I expect, Milord.
NELL=>A prank? A jest?
MILORD=>Go and see, John.
NELL=>Bedlam --? It doesn't look so merry a place, Milord. . .
MILORD=>Never been there?
MILORD=>You'll have to pay Master Sims tupence to see the loonies in their cages — maybe they can teach you some new tricks, Nell.
NELL=>I've no need of their wit to entertain you, Milord.
JOHN=>They say, sir, that one of the poor devils in there fell from the roof, trying to escape.
MILORD=>Very regrettable — well, drive on.
JOHN=>Your Lordship — it seems to me the man was known to you.
MILORD=>Eh?
JOHN=>I thought I saw him in your company not a week gone by.
MILORD=>Eh — really?
MILORD=>Well, let's have a look.
JOHN=>You — with the light —
MILORD=>It is — it is young Master Colby.
WARDER=>He fell trying to escape. Some of our boobies haven't sense enough to keep safe behind their bars.
MILORD=>Where is Sims?
MILORD=>Fetch him.
WARDER=>He is dining out, Milord.
MILORD=>Dining out with Colby's blood on his hands! Do you know me?
WARDER=>Yes, Milord,
MILORD=>Then tell Master Sims to wait upon me in the morning. I have some few words I wish to say to him.
SIMS=>Will you remind Lord Mortimer that I am waiting.
MILORD=>Well, Pompey, are you a pretty boy this morning?
NELL=>What are you trying to do, Pompey?
POMPEY=>Milord, I want to look like the visitor in the hallway.
MILORD=>Sims! I'd forgotten Sims! You there clear out. I want room for anger.
NELL=>Send in the good Sims — first course for Milord's rage, to be eaten with a sauce of Lightning, and to the tune of thunder - Send him in — send him in —
MILORD'S VOICE=>Sims!
MILORD'S VOICE=>Sims!
MILORD=>-- that you hated him I knew, that you envied him was known to all, but that you would dare -- dare to leave that murderous window open -- to murder him from spite and envy -
SIMS=>Murder, Milord? There was no murder. Jackson was my guest. He decided to leave the window before I could open the door for him and then -- that monstrous accident.
NELL=>Accident? Master Sims is writing a new dictionary.
NELL=>Are accidents contrived, plotted, executed?
SIMS=>Exactly, Mistress Bowen. This was a misadventure contrived by the victim and executed by nature's law that those who lose their grip on gutters must fall.
MILORD=>You stick to that story, Master Sims?
SIMS=>I could never invent one half so droll. The characters of the tale; two poets — Colby and myself. But I am not only a poet, but also, by your Lordship's favor, the Apothecary General of St. Mary's of Bethlehem Hospital. My friend comes to discuss poetry. I am absent. My guards mistake my friend for a mad man. He attempts to escape from them and is killed -- like a romance, Milord.
MILORD=>It's a romance that cost me twenty guineas and a night of laughter.
SIMS=>How so, Milord?
NELL=>Lord Mortimer was foolish enough to pay in advance for poetry promised in the future. Jackson was to write a masque for the fete Lord Mortimer is giving.
SIMS=>If I could offer my humble talents - even at the hospital I deal in wit and laughter, Madame. Are there any who have come to Bedlam and say the entertainment is not worth the tupence they paid?
NELL=>You don't entertain me, Master Sims.
SIMS=>That is because you have a tender heart. Most people laugh at my ugliness.
NELL=>It offends me, sir.
SIMS=>To move a lady so beautiful in any way --
MILORD=>He's gallant, too.
SIMS=>I am as you wish, Milord, and I shall make your fete a frolic you will remember.'
MILORD=>How?
SIMS=>Sometimes the success of the play belongs to the players. What if the masque were performed by my company of wits, the Bedlamites?
MILORD=>Have your loonies perform?
MILORD=>The opposition --- not John Wilkes nor his whole Whig Party -- could think of anything as clever as that, eh, Nell?
NELL=>You didn't think of it either.
MILORD=>Well, it's one and the same thing —
MILORD=>My friend, here, thought of it.
SIMS=>Let us say that you inspired the thought, Milord.
MILORD=>You hear that Nell? I inspired him.
SIMS=>Let us say that you both inspired me — Milord and the beloved of Milord.
NELL=>I think you misunderstand, Master Sims. I am Milord's protege. I entertain him and he has no more freedom with me than any other man.
SIMS=>I£, Milord, will but give me the day and hour of the fete, I'll prepare a masque of madness to set you howling.
MILORD=>A week from today at the Vauxhall. The company assembles at eight.
SIMS=>Thank you. With your leave --
MILORD=>A merry notion --
NELL=>The Lord Mayor will roll in the soup with laughter.
MILORD=>A capital fellow this Sims -- a capital fellow.
NELL=>If you ask me, Milord, he's a stench in the nostrils, a sewer of ugliness and a gutter brimming with slop.
MILORD=>But witty.
NELL=>So he tells us.
MILORD=>Even if his wit is wanting his Bedlamites will set my guests roaring. Everyone who goes to Bedlam expires with laughter. Why don't you go and see them, Nell? You'll see how funny they are.
NELL=>Perhaps I will.
PODGE=>Good morning, Master Sims.
PODGE=>There is a Quaker waiting for you, sir -- a master stone mason. Will you have him in?
SIMS=>Podge where is my rhyming lexicon? I want a rhyme for Mortimer.
PODGE=>That Quaker, sir -—
SIMS=>Whatever are you rattling on about? I have an important commission —- a rhymed comedy for Milord Mortimer - and you bother me with some snivelling Quaker.
PODGE=>He's been waiting so long.
SIMS=>Waiting?
PODGE=>Four hours, sir.
SIMS=>I waited three hours for Lord Mortimer before he would give me a dog's word. Let him wait.
PODGE=>He will not wait. He's a good workman and cheap, I'm told.
SIMS=>Cheap? Let him in.
SIMS=>You may leave us, Podge.
SIMS=>My clerk tells me that you will do the work cheaply.
HANNAY=>With cut stone one foot thick and the best mortar, I could do the work for fifteen guineas.
SIMS=>What if I were to give you eighteen guineas?
HANNAY=>It would be too much.
SIMS=>Eighteen guineas and you are to return to me two — then you would I have a better price and I would I have some reason to employ you.
HANNAY=>My friend —- I have forgotten what thee has said. If thee do not repeat it, then I can believe no evil of thee.
SIMS=>What kind of can't is this? I've asked you for a bribe, man! You've never been asked before? This is simple business between us two.
HANNAY=>My friend, about the stone masonry -
SIMS=>I had not looked forward to the pleasure of seeing you so I soon again, Mistress Bowen.
NELL=>I have a curiosity to see the loonies in their cages.
SIMS=>And so you shall — and so you shall.
SIMS=>Your riding crop. Mistress Bowen. You must hang it here. It's a law of the institute — no weapons —
NELL=>For Heaven's sake, why?
SIMS=>In his play, Dekker, a second-rate dramatist of the last century, wrote of those in there --
SIMS=>"Fierce as wild bulls/ untamable as flys,/ And these have oft/ from stranger's sides,/ Snatched rapiers suddenly/ and done much harm."
NELL=>Strangely — one forgets you are a man of letters, Master Sims.
SIMS=>Our hospital is ancient and well known -- much written of —- I dare say, no man or woman comes to London from the country who does not pay his tupence.
SIMS=>Are they not witty, Mistress Bowen? Look at the frolic that this one treats himself to. All day long weaving nets to catch peacocks for the Royal dinner.
NELL=>They are all so lonely -- they are all in themselves and by themselves. They pay no heed to us.
SIMS=>You noticed that. They have their world and we have ours.
NELL=>) Like separate dreams.
SIMS=>Ours is a human world, theirs is a bestial world -- without reason and without soul. They're animals.
SIMS=>Some are dogs, These I beat.
SIMS=>--and some are pigs.
SIMS=>--these I let wallow in their own filth.
SIMS=>Some are tigers -- their remedy is a dose of iron -- chains.
SIMS=>—- and some, like this one are doves.
NELL=>I've seen enough.
SIMS=>But you haven't seen the ones in the cages —-
NELL=>I've seen enough.
SIMS=>-- but you have no idea how merry they can be -- what amusement they afford --
NELL=>Amusement? From that mad girl with her staring eyes?
SIMS=>If I have offended you, Mistress Bowen --
NELL=>Thank you, sir. My valet can plait a tress or twirl a furbelow quicker than a handy woman, but he has no knack with horses.
HANNAY=>I was glad to do thee this service, I saw thee strike Sims. Thee should not have done that.
NELL=>Do you think I'm afraid of him? Do you think he could harm me?
HANNAY=>Thee are able enough. It is the poor ones in there I'm thinking of. Sims will make them suffer for that blow.
NELL=>Are we lovers, that you "thee" and "thou" me? I've never seen your face before,
VARNEY=>He's a Quaker, Mistress Bowen,
HANNAY=>My name is William Hannay. I am one of the Society of Friends.
NELL=>I've heard of them. They turn the other cheek,
HANNAY=>There's more to being a Quaker than turning the other check, and saying "thee" and "thou". It's feeling pity for those in there, as you did,
NELL=>Do you think I struck him because I felt pity for the loonies?
HANNAY=>I saw it in thy face.
NELL=>Pity? I had no such feelings, sir. I struck the man because I wanted to — because he is an ugly thing in a pretty world.
HANNAY=>There are many ugly things in this pretty world, if thou would but see them.
NELL=>Master Quaker, I did not always wear velvet.
HANNAY=>Eh, I had guessed that. But where there is one like thee to wrest comfort from a hard world with wit and cleverness there are ten thousand who can not.
NELL=>I have no pity for them. Let them do as I did.
HANNAY=>But those in there -- Can they help themselves?
NELL=>And I have no pity for them, either -- animals without souls --
HANNAY=>That is not thy thoughts.
NELL=>Is it not? Come a week hence to Vauxhall in the evening and you will see me laughing at those same loonies you think I pity.
HANNAY=>Thou will not laugh at the poor and the afflicted -- not thee. I have seen great ladies and their hearts were like stone, but thee --
NELL=>My heart is a flint, sir -- it may strike sparks, but they are not warm enough to burn. I have no time to make a show of loving kindness before my fellow men -- not in this life. I've too much laughing to do.
SIMS=>--and here, Milord, is the spirit of Lunacy to illuminate the Golden Age of Reason —
SIMS=>Lit by Lunacy and speaking with the voice of Youth, the Age of Reason will tell you of its brightest adornment-- Milord Mortimer.
SIMS=>Come Reason, you've wit enough to say a word or two.
MILORD=>What say you to this Wilkes --a mad boy playing Reason. That's a Tory joke for you.
WILKES=>...And only the Tories laugh at it. The opposition wonders what the effect may be on that sick young boy. The Tories care only for the jest, we Whigs have some concern for the humanities.
MILORD=>You hear that, Nell — give them a jest and they answer with a political tirade.
NELL=>He said something about the boy -- the effect --?
MILORD=>Go and ask him. He'll make you a speech on the matter.
GILDED BOY=>To this pretty world —
GILDED BOY'S VOICE=>— pretty world --
GILDED BOY=>To this pretty world, there came Heaven sent, Divinely Inspired —-
SIMS=>Good — good — the great voice of reason.
GILDED BOY=>The blessing of our age —
SIMS=>Come, come! I spent all morning beating it into your head.
SIMS=>You see, Milord, Reason is overcome with emotion when it must speak of you.
MILORD=>Prod him on, Sims.
SIMS=>Come on! A few more of those golden words I taught you, lad.
GILDED BOY=>A man set like a jewel --
WILKES=>The effect? Somewhere I heard that the human body must breathe through its pores. If you shut those pores -
SIMS=>Another word, good, gentle Reason.
GILDED BOY=>— this prince of men, this paragon -
SIMS=>Go on.
SIMS' VOICE=>Go on -- go on!
GILDED BOY=>Lord Mortimer —-
MILORD=>Bless me, Nell, better than your parrot -- what an eulogy -— from a mad boy freezing with ague and burning with fevers.
SIMS=>Duck him in the river -- a bit of canvas and a handful of coarse sand will get the gilt off.
NELL=>Master Sims —
NELL=>Isn't that harsh treatment for a sick lad?
SIMS=>They have to get off the gilt if he's to be well again.
NELL=>So you know that.
SIMS=>Know what, Mistress Bowen?
NELL=>You know that anyone painted over so thick as this poor lad will die.
SIMS=>If I understand you properly, this boy is dying because --
FOOTMAN=>The boy is dead, sir.
SIMS=>-- the boy is dead because his pores were clogged by the gilt.
SIMS=>Well, then, sweet Mistress Bowen, as you are such a stickler for the correct definition, you will grant me the legal fact that this boy died by his own exhalations. You might say — he poisoned himself.
FOOTMAN=>Where shall we take him?
SIMS=>I have told you -- the river — canvas — sand -- there is no change in my order.
NELL=>Milord -- have we not had enough of this?
MILORD=>Eh?
NELL=>Enough of this boring, dull man and his cruelty. "
MILORD=>But we're all laughing, Nell.
NELL=>I'm not laughing, Milord..
MILORD=>He shall make you laugh. Sims!
NELL=>Spare me that.
MILORD=>But Nell —
NELL=>A boy died tonight —- a boy -- a boy who had no mind to guide his thoughts or deeds — maybe there'll be some concern about that among the Whigs. There certainly is none among the Tories.
MILORD=>Oh, you'll find they're laughing too.
LORD SANDWICH=>Liberty — that is a great word you Whigs found somewhere, but just the same, you'll end either with the pox or on the gallows.
WILKES=>That, Milord, depends on whether I embrace your sweetheart or your politics.
SIMS=>Here is Alfrieda, Queen of the Artichokes. She will sing for you.
NELL'S VOICE=>Master Hannay --
HANNAY=>This is a strange place to see thee, Mistress Bowen,
NELL=>A little dull perhaps — but a good enough place to ask the questions I want to ask.
HANNAY=>So far, Mistress Bowen, I have found thee more ready with answers then with questions.
NELL=>Don't fear -- my questions are pert enough. First, do you think me a woman of kind heart?
HANNAY=>So I have told thee.
NELL=>Why?
HANNAY=>I saw thy face at Bedlam — it had compassion and kindness.
NELL=>I have never seen that in my mirror. But let's say I grant the fact — let's say I saw things that moved me to pity -- what then, Master Quaker?
HANNAY=>Perhaps God sent thee here so that thee might find guidance -—
NELL=>From you?
HANNAY=>I have not said so.
NELL=>Well, from whom then?
HANNAY=>Perhaps he sent thee so that we might speak together.
NELL=>I have seen things tonight I have no liking for — my friends laughing at sorry idiots brought out from Bedlam to amuse them -- a poor boy --
HANNAY=>Thou need not tell me. It Is a bad time for the poor -- and people suffer, the ones With wit and the ones-without.
NELL=>And if you feel sorry for them -— what do you do about all this?
HANNAY=>I do what I can. I am a stone mason.
NELL=>How does that help people?
HANNAY=>I build well -- let others build as well — and soon this city will be a clean and decent habitation.
NELL=>But what of me? What can I do? I'm only a jester to bring laughter to Lord Mortimer's dinner table.
HANNAY=>Perhaps even in the amusement of Mortimer there may be a way for thee to help the poor people in Bedlam. Is not Mortimer a member of the Council?
NELL=>Good. You're not such a fool as I thought you. But why don't you remove your hat — have you no liking for me?
HANNAY=>It is a rule among the Friends to uncover only before God.
SIMS=>Good morning, Mistress Bowen,
NELL=>Good morning.
MILORD=>Ah, there, Sims -- Ah, Sit down and wait a bit, I've news for you.
SIMS=>I trust you enjoyed the fete.
NELL=>You will hear presently how much I enjoyed it.
MILORD=>Sims, you've no idea what we've decided, Nell has a splendid
SIMS=>I can quite understand what Mistress Bowen wants. We've needed good beds and good food in Bedlam for a long while,
NELL=>You've forgotten to mention good treatment, Master Sims,
SIMS=>That, too, I'm sure we could afford that.
SIMS=>You can't imagine what gratitude I bear you, Mistress Bowen, Those reforms you propose will make my name stand out in the history of Bedlam --
MILORD=>We know you'd agree.
SIMS=>I'm overjoyed, Milord,
MILORD=>Good — good. You see, it's done, Nell -- not a bit of trouble.
SIMS=>There is but one little point, Milord — the trifling matter of money.
NELL=>Milord has thought of that..
MILORD=>Of course — of course - the council will vote the funds.
SIMS=>That is generous of you, Milord very generous.
NELL=>How so, Sims? What sort of generosity?
SIMS=>Does not Milord have property in Moorfields?
MILORD=>A dozen dwelling houses — a warehouse — two inns. You see, Sims, I know my accounts,
SIMS=>I know your properties. They are taxable by the institute, therefore, Milord, this reform would cost you no loss than five hundred guineas in additional taxes. But what is that to you, Milord -- a more bagatelle — some little gift you'd gladly give to Mistress Bowen,
NELL=>I'll relinquish that little gift, Master Sims.
MILORD=>I gave you no gift, Nell.
SIMS=>She merely speaks, Milord, of a gift she's not going to have. Now take Master Wilkes -- he would never be so generous -- he would say, "Loonies don't vote."
MILORD=>But that's true. There is nothing to be had from them.
NELL=>You were going to do this as a kind deed, Milord.
SIMS=>Five hundred guineas.
MILORD=>There would be so much I would have to do without. We'll have to forget this whim of yours, Nell.
NELL=>It is not a whim, Milord. It is the first thing I've asked of you.
SIMS=>Now, Mistress Bowen, Milord has to keep up appearances at Court — that's a great expense to a man.
MILORD=>That's true. You've no idea, Nell, what a great responsibility it is to be rich— what an expense.
NELL=>It's simply this, Milord — I've asked you to do a good deed - and you find the very thought of it too expensive.
MILORD=>You've no right to speak to me that way, Nell.
NELL=>I've all the rights of having put up with you for almost a year Milord — trying to make you laugh and then listening to that fat laugh of yours as it comes rumbling out of your fat throat.
MILORD=>Put up with me -- with me --
NELL=>I said so.
MILORD=>But look what I've done for you. You'd be camping In the rain on Strathmore Common with the other strolling players if you had not caught my eye.
NELL=>Do you call that weak and watery vessel your eye? I would not want to look at the world through it. I would not want to be a dull man forever in need of amusement. I would not want to bribe and be bribed -- to fawn upon the king and kick the commoner - in short, Milord, I would not want to be Lord Mortimer.
SIMS=>Such angry words.
MILORD=>You would not want -- you would not want --
NELL=>Nor do I want to be with you -- not for an instant longer - maybe being rich and great and powerful is infectious -- it's a disease I don't want to catch. Goodbye, Milord.
SIMS=>Of course, as I pointed out to you, you have every right to take legal steps --
MILORD=>You've been very helpful, Sims.
SIMS=>But it grieves me, Milord, to have been the cause of the quarrel.
MILORD=>It was not your fault. She quarreled with me. She insulted me.
POMPEY=>May I guide you to the door, Master Sims?
BAILIFF=>You know Lord Mortimer's signature --is this not it?
NELL=>I can recognize a pig's tracks when I see them.
BAILIFF=>Then you know I have the right to remove the furniture which he loaned you.
NELL=>Loan does he call it? He and that loathsome Sims.
BAILIFF=>It is all legal -- all by order.
NELL=>Oh, take it and get out!
VARNEY=>That's not Lord Mortimer's.
NELL=>Leave Poll alone. She's no present to bo given and taken back.
VARNEY=>She's been with Mistress Bowen since Mistress Bowen played "Aurora" in "The Rivals." We did very well in that.
NELL=>Serves me right, Varney. A kind heart butters no parsnips.
VARNEY=>But what shall we do, Mistress Bowen? We've nothing but the clothes we wear and poor Poll.
NELL=>Poll? Poll's enough---
SIMS=>--and—remember if gin is offered you, my dear, you must take wine — it is more genteel.
MISTRESS SIMS=>But I like gin. It makes me merry.
SIMS=>You'll be merry enough on wine.
MISTRESS SIMS=>But you tell me that Lord Mortimer likes a witty girl.
SIMS=>You'd best leave the wit to me, I'll make you seem witty.
MISTRESS SIMS=>I can crack a joke well enough.
SIMS=>Not in good company, my dear niece. You're not accustomed to it, you know.
MISTRESS SIMS=>I've known some gentlemen.
SIMS=>But this is a lord -- a man from whose largess many blessings can come to the family of Sims -- and all for just a little laughter. That's all he wants — to be amused.
MISTRESS SIMS=>A fine lord indeed! Mocked by a parrot.
SIMS=>But that parrot is our key to open Milord's friendship to you. Remember, you were offended -- you offered money --
SIMS=>Milord — a dreadful things --
SIMS=>Lord Mortimer, this is my niece, Kitty.
MILORD=>A charming person -- she does you honor, Sims. But have you heard the latest news of my lady Mistress Nell? What a jest she's hit upon.
SIMS=>You mean the parrot, Milord? It is because of that we've come here.
MILORD=>-- A great bit of jest -- what a vixen!
SIMS=>I had hardly thought to find you in such humor.
MILORD=>But it's only a jest. Nell has the bird for sale in the market place letting it scream that silly ditty, "Lord Mortimer is like a pig, His brain's small and his belly big." All London's come to laugh at the bird.
SIMS=>So they have. And It does you no good, Milord, This joke will make your proud name a mockery.
MILORD=>The bird won't sing too long. I've sent Pompey to buy it,
MISTRESS SIMS=>That girl holds the bird at a high enough price.
SIMS=>My niece knowing of my affection for you tried to buy the bird. She offered twenty guineas and was refused.
MILORD=>Oh, Mistress Bowen wants more honey, on her bread than that, Sims." Pompey has a purse with a hundred guineas in it.
MISTRESS SIMS=>A hundred guineas for a bird!
MILORD=>Will you have some wine, Mistress Sims?
MISTRESS SIMS=>Wine is too French for me, Milord. It is the way I feel about men. I like men to be as big as beer and as strong as gin. Beer has a head on it, you know. You can't say that for wine. Gin has some muscle to it and you can't say that for wine either.
MILORD=>Bless me, I've never heard anyone put it that way.
SIMS=>There is much to be said for our national institutions.
MILORD=>Come in.
MILORD=>She refused?
POMPEY=>She said it was not enough.
MILORD=>What sort of game is this?
POMPEY=>Mistress Bowen told me to tell you the bird would remain for sale and that you could sell every property you owned and not have money enough to buy it.
SIMS=>Oh — that's the way the wind blows, Milord.
MILORD=>Malign me - The girl digs her spurs too deep.
SIMS=>Milord, we can always make her my guest.
MILORD=>At Bedlam — no, no. She's as sane as you and I.
SIMS=>Was Colby mad? He was my guest.
MILORD=>We've been good comrades, Nell and I. I'll not do that.
SIMS=>As you will, Milord.
MISTRESS SIMS=>Here, Milord. Here's confusion to your enemies.
SIMS=>It's a shrewd trick. You can't re strain a parrot from slander -- you can't exercise the right of privacy against a bird. But I have a way, Milord.
MISTRESS SIMS=>Another drink? It will make you a lion.
MILORD=>I'm an angry man.
SIMS=>There are laws against the depredations of live stock, Milord, is not a parrot live stock? Are you not suffering loss. You know that, "he who steals my purse steals trash - but he who --"
MISTRESS SIMS=>Why I heard that at the playhouse.
MILORD=>What do you suggest?
SIMS=>We can swear out a writ of seizure - send a bailiff for the parrot and have it here within the hour,
MILORD=>We could do that.
SIMS=>Indeed we can.
MISTRESS SILK=>Arrest a parrot? I'll drink on that, Milord.
BAILIFF=>Come along -- come along.
HANNAY=>I told thee no good would come of it. Thee can not mock thy friends this way.
NELL=>Mock him -- he'll wish I'd only mocked him when I finish.
HANNAY=>Softly.
NELL=>Bah!
MILORD=>I swore I'd wring its neck. Give me that bird, Varney.
NELL=>Your gifts you can take back, Milord, but the parrot was mine, is mine and remains mine as long as I want.
HANNAY=>Thee must be careful of other's property.
MILORD=>Curse you, man! You'll fight me for this.
MILORD=>Draw man, draw!
HANNAY=>As thee can see, I an weaponless, I do not fight nor brawl with other men.
MILORD=>You will fight me.
HANNAY=>I cannot!
MILORD=>Fight or I'll run you through.
MILORD=>Will you not fight?
NELL=>Milord --
HANNAY=>Friend, thou hast no quarrel with me.
PARROT=>Lord Mortimer -- Lord Mortimer --
HANNAY=>Thee must not mock thy friend.
HANNAY=>Thee can earn an honest living for thyself.
NELL=>I had to sew my costumes when I was on the stage.
VARNEY=>Two shillings a week and all found for a seamstress.
HANNAY=>One can live well on that if one is frugal.
NELL=>What would I do with Varney? Who'd have him?
HANNAY=>Thou hast not strength enough for a mason, Varney.
NELL=>You see?
HANNAY=>Just the same I'll give Varney work. He can sweep up the dust here. He has strength enough for that,
NELL=>He sweeps, and I sew -- all very fine, but not very exciting. What do you think of it, Varney?
VARNEY=>I like a merry life, Mistress Bowen.
NELL=>And so by blazes -- so do I! Everyone makes his living with his own tricks. My tricks are not yours, Master Stonemason.
VARNEY=>If I may say a word. Mistress Bowen -- you still have many friends
NELL=>That I have! There's Captain Standing — but he's always talking about Fontenoy —- and Mr. Armiston and Wilkes -— there's Wilkes -— "That devil Wilkes." He's a clever man and Sims fears him.
WILKES=>So far as I'm concerned, dear Mistress Bowen, you need not teach your parrot any special phrases for my benefit.
NELL=>Am I to understand from that, Master Wilkes that you're not interested — not in Bedlam nor in me?
WILKES=>I did not mean that. I meant only that I am a different sort of a man from Lord Mortimer. I am not easily pleased.
NELL=>I think you expect too much, Master Wilkes.
WILKES=>I offer more. You want to fight the nastiness and the corruption of Bedlam and I offer you political alliance with John Wilkes. Bring me evidence and I'll be pleased to take it to court.
NELL=>Let us say that puts a brighter face on the matter Master Wilkes .
WILKES=>One gives a girl a kiss to seal a certain kind of bargain, Nell.
NELL=>This is a rather public place, Master Wilkes.
WILKES=>But one shakes hands with a comrade and a friend.
FRIEND=>This is a real blow at Wilkes,
SIMS=>It is a blow I'll leave you to administer. I've a blow of his to ward away.
SIMS=>-- and so you see, Mistress Bowen, Milord thought it would --be best to make friends again.
NELL=>On your advice, I suppose, and for some purpose of your own?
SIMS=>Milord, speak to the girl.
MILORD=>Every word he says is true and better put than I could say it,
NELL=>Well, so we're friends again. You go your way and I go my way.
SIMS=>But friends aren't that off-handed with each other, Mistress Bowen, Milord would like to be kind to you.
NELL=>I'm duly warned. Go on.
SIMS=>Milord thinks you've been looking rather pale as of late — perhaps the waters of Bath — a rest —
NELL=>Milord, you know that I have a contempt for certain kinds of money. How deep that contempt is I am about to show you.
SIMS=>The Bank of England thanks you for three hundred pounds.
SIMS=>Tomorrow after the Commission for Lunacy examines her she will strike no more blows — not at you nor at me.
SIMS=>Here — you sign here.
MILORD=>But confound me, Sims, I can't sign this. She's not mad. She's not a danger to herself and others, as it says here.
SIMS=>Sign, Milord. She's a danger to my position and to your properties. Alone she means nothing. With Wilkes behind her she's more dangerous to us than any mad woman.
MILORD=>But I don't like to do this.
SIMS=>Sign.
NELL=>I'm twenty-three years of age - born at Rye -- my parents are dead and I have no husband nor child -- what more would you wish to know?
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>The Commission of Lunacy will frame the questions for you, Mistress Bowen.
NELL=>Ask away.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>Do you know your alphabet?
NELL=>I know A from Zed and I can read and write as readily as any man I see before me -- Perhaps a little better,
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>Do you know the difference between right and wrong?
NELL=>What is right for you - that much I know -- and vice versa.
NELL=>Oh, don't fool yourself, A merry answer does not make me a fool, gentlemen. Ask me a sensible question and you shall have a sensible—answer —-
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>Mistress Bowen, is it true that some days past you refused the sum of one hundred gold guineas for a parrot not worth five shillings?
NELL=>I had my reasons. It was a jest.
SECOND COMMISSIONER=>You know your sums?
NELL=>If two and two make four -- I do.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>Knowing that one number added to another makes a greater number, I presume you know a large sum of money from a small sum.
NELL=>I only know I like large sums better than I like small sums.
SECOND COMMISSIONER=>Then why did you refuse one hundred guineas for a parrot worth five shillings?
NELL=>I told you it was a jest.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>Knowing the value of money, Mistress Bowen, can you explain why it was that you ate a bank note?
NELL=>For a jest. The Chief Commissioner nods.
NELL=>Master Sims knows why I ate the money — to show my contempt for it.
SECOND COMMISSIONER=>Is that how one shows contempt?
NELL=>No. But at that moment it was the only way to show contempt, I was angry and that's what occurred to me.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>Do thoughts, like that always occur to you when you are angry?
NELL=>But surely everyone does foolish things some times — at a whim — for a prank —
SECOND COMMISSIONER=>Is it wise to eat money?
NELL=>But it was a jest.
NELL=>Sir — gentlemen — would you permit me to communicate with Mr. John Wilkes — he would speak for me.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>This is not a court -- you are not in need of any witnesses but your own sanity and we shall judge the worth of that.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>Mistress Bowen you have asked for voluntary commitment to enter St. Mary's of Bethlehem Asylum, The charges for your care and keep are to be borne by Milord Mortimer and I have here — the commission's approval of your request. The commission has adjudged you insane.
NELL=>But I made no petition to enter Bedlam.
SIMS=>Perhaps you did it in jest, Mistress Bowen,
NELL=>You're not going to put me in Bedlam -- not for a little joke — not for playing a trick —
NELL=>Milords — gentlemen — please listen — I'm of sound mind --I know what I do -- I know what I say, I did not ask for admission to Bedlam -- please — please —
SIMS=>Here in Bedlam, my dear, we cannot feed you bank notes.
SIMS=>Try chewing on this.
MILORD'S VOICE=>Polly wants a cracker.
POLL=>Polly wants a cracker.
MILORD=>You see, Varney, now that he is mine, I've already taught him a new and original trick,
VARNEY=>Yes, Milord.
MILORD=>Ah, my love -- and how did you spend the night?
MISTRESS SIMS=>Are you going on a voyage, Milord?
MILORD=>Oh, no, not a voyage. Just a trip to the country to ride -- to smell the innocent air -- to listen to the twitter of the birds -- to rusticate -—
MISTRESS SIMS=>I see — to rusticate,
MILORD=>I would invite you, my dear, but it's a bachelor occasion -- sport, you know -- manly things.
MISTRESS SIMS=>I see.
MISTRESS SIMS=>Well, all good things must end, Milord, I'll have a bit of the gin.
MISTRESS SIMS=>And another little sip to take away the dry taste of piety.
MILORD=>Piety? I thought there was precious little of that in this house.
MISTRESS SIMS=>There's a Quaker outside who wants to see you. Pompey is sending him about his business.
POMPEY=>—- such a person has never been known in this household.
HANNAY=>Come now -- thou must know that to be an untruth. Nell Bowen had tea with Milord only yesterday.
POMPEY=>Your young lady was the one who was telling tales. There's been no woman in this house but Mistress Sims since I can remember — so they tell me.
HANNAY=>Well, never mind.
VARNEY=>Where is the Quaker?
POMPEY=>He's been and gone.
VARNEY=>He must have just left.
POMPEY=>That's likely.
VARNEY'S VOICE=>Master Hannay -- Master Hannay —-
VARNEY=>I'll tell you where she is, Master Hannay. I'll tell you where she is -- they put her in Bedlam.
HANNAY=>In Bedlam?
VARNEY=>Aye -- yesterday -- they summoned her. She's there, now.
HANNAY=>Well -- friend -- thee must come with me. We shall go to Bedlam.
VARNEY=>No, no. I can't go with you. I'm employed by Milord,
VARNEY=>You see, Master Stonemason, I have to live.
VARNEY=>And you, yourself, said I haven't muscle enough for honest work.
HANNAY=>It is enough that thee is an honest man, Varney -- that thee ran all this way to tell me where she is.
VOICE=>Nell Bowen — Nell Bowen --
VOICES=>Nell Bowen -- Nell Bowen -- Nell Bowen --
LONG=>Is that your name they
NELL=>How do they know I am here?
LONG=>They don't know. Some of our poor companions spend their days looking out the window. If they hear a new cry they repeat it, then others take it up and so it goes.
NELL=>But my name -- how do they know?
LONG=>Someone shouted in the street -- someone trying to reach you.
NELL=>Oh -- thank you -- thank you.
YOUNG WARDER=>You can't come in.
HANNAY=>By George Sims' order I suppose.
YOUNG WARDER=>Even so.
HANNAY=>And may I see Sims?
YOUNG WARDER=>And quickly too.
HANNAY=>I've been refused admittance.
SIMS=>That is unfortunate -- but a new ruling -- you understand --
HANNAY=>I understand only that I am a free man -- that I have money in my hand. You have no legal right to deny me entry to a place where others have been admitted.
SIMS=>Quite true -- quite true.
HANNAY=>Well?
SIMS=>The warder will take your tupence.
SIMS=>And now if you will leave your arms at the arms rack --
HANNAY=>I have no arms. I am of the Society of Friends.
SIMS=>Then I'm afraid we must return your tupence.
HANNAY=>But why?
SIMS=>Did you not quote the law to me? Let me then quote law to you -- It is a rule of our institute that any who go into the main hall must hang their arms upon that rack.
HANNAY=>But I have no arms.
SIMS=>Since you have none, I cannot let you enter.
HANNAY=>Thou cannot deny me entrance for such cause.
SIMS=>I must.
SIMS=>It is a rule, and I break no rules, Master Quaker.
FIRST STONE MASON=>Brother Hannay — I'll be blasted -- sauntering as if it were a holiday.
HANNAY=>On my own business, friend Smith, and without profanity.
SECOND STONE MASON=>And without this good job of work that we have, Hannay.
HANNAY=>I bid for it.
SECOND STONE MASON=>And found Master Sims' way of doing business a little strange, eh?
FIRST STONE MASON=>We've the work -- we've the will — let's at it boys!
HANNAY=>But you haven't the knack of it.
FIRST MASON=>Thanks, Hannay.
SECOND MASON=>Maybe you'd give us a hand.
THIRD MASON=>There are but three of us.
HANNAY=>I'd just as leave.
FIRST MASON=>You call.
HANNAY=>One — two — heave, all.
HANNAY=>Lead away.
FIRST MASON=>Call!
HANNAY=>One, and two and down we go!
FIRST MASON=>Thanks, Hannay.
HANNAY=>Thee is welcome.
SECOND MASON=>Now you're here, Hannay, you can see all of Bedlam without paying your tupence. Can't he, lads?
FIRST STONE MASON=>Oh, aye -- indeed you can. All the wonders of Bedlam for nothing.
HANNAY=>That I would like to see.
THIRD STONE MASON=>This corridor leads to the main room.
SECOND STONE MASON=>It's a little dark maybe, but If you get to the end of it, Hannay, you'll see an eyeful.
HANNAY=>Down this way?
HANNAY=>If thee don't mind I'll go and look.
FIRST MASON=>He'll be back soon enough.
SECOND MASON=>Never fear.
THIRD MASON=>Like a shot from a gun.
HANNAY=>Nell — Nell Bowen —
VOICES=>Nell Bowen — Nell Bowen --

HANNAY=>Nell Bowen —
VOICES=>Nell Bowen -- Nell Bowen —
HANNAY=>Come Nell -- Nell —
NELL=>You've come to take me away.
HANNAY=>No. There is no way.
NELL=>Find Wilkes. He'll get me out
HANNAY=>I had thought of that. I'll seek him out, but until he can free thee, thee must be patient.
NELL=>Patient? How can I be patient? I'm terrified -- these people are like beasts.
HANNAY=>So thou has that same thought --the same thought as Sims.
NELL=>No. But they frighten mo. They're dirty -- savage -- mindless — disgusting --
HANNAY=>Thee wanted to help them — they put thee here -- for trying to aid them.
NELL=>I still want to aid them, but I can not here -- not here where they are all about me. All I want is release or a weapon to defend myself.
HANNAY=>Thee has thy kindness and thy courage -- they can be sword and buckler to thee in this place.
NELL=>I want better weapons -- I want something more than my naked hands to help me if there should be trouble. Give me a weapon.
HANNAY=>Thee knows that I carry no sword.
NELL=>Anything.
HANNAY=>I carry nothing that could harm my fellow creatures.
NELL=>Your trowel.
HANNAY=>That is to build with.
NELL=>It has a point -- it has a handle.
NELL=>Would you have me maimed -- scratched —- scarred?
NELL=>My face?
HANNAY=>The Lord will not let it happen,
NELL=>Give me the trowel and I will not let it happen.
NELL=>Look at my face again — look close - shall it be scarred?
HANNAY=>God forgive me for what I do.
NELL=>Forgiven or not, at least I can defend myself. Now get to Master Wilkes. Wilkes will have me out of here like that.
LARD=>I haven't seen Wilkes for the last week.
HANNAY=>He's never at home.
LARD=>He's electioneering.
HANNAY=>But where?
LARD=>Anywhere in the Kingdom.
HANNAY=>It is a matter of import — grave import -- a woman's reason hangs on It. I must see him.
LARD=>He has ordered pamphlets and posters from me. He has to come here. When he does, I'll tell him.
HANNAY=>I'll be back tomorrow.
LONG=>We night ask her, Master Todd — she seems quite lady-like — quite sane, or as I might express myself before the bar, compos mentis en lex.
LONG=>Then I shall ask her. We can have Dan. The four of us can play Paroli.
LONG=>...Madame, would you care to join us? We are going to play Paroli,
NELL=>That's kind of you. But I have no money,
LONG=>Money? We play on our word.
NELL=>I have a wealth of words; I don't cheat but I warn you I'm not above amending the mistakes of fortune.
LONG=>This Mistress Brown, is Oliver Todd, He will not speak to you, nor to me, but there is no harm in him and he writes and reasons well. And this Is Dan, sometimes he fancies himself a dog -- sometimes the rider of a spirited horse, but he has no malice in him and he remembers how to play cards. I am Long -- Sidney Long, the Crown Solicitor — whose enemies will not let him practice at the bar! I, the most skilled of them all, I have many enemies — many, many enemies.
NELL=>I understand.
LONG=>I should not have told you that. But believe me, we who are near this pillar are the safe ones -- the good ones — the wisest --that is why they let us have the candle - but the rest — you must be careful of the rest.
NELL=>I am careful.
LONG=>Let us begin the play.
LONG=>I will hold the bank -- twenty thousand pounds —
NELL=>Five pounds for a card,
LONG=>Five pounds.
DAN=>Five whippets, ten bassets, one gaze hound.
LONG=>Does anyone wish another card?
NELL=>Five pounds.
LONG=>Banko.
NELL=>Paroli.
LONG=>Fortune smiles at your first play. What card?
NELL=>Knave of Spades.
L0NG=>You win.
DAN=>Eight bulldogs.
NELL=>What's that?
LONG=>A poor wretch — Sims gave him a dose of iron this morning. The chains scruff his flesh.
NELL=>Will the warders not help him?
LONG=>They've heard too many groans to bother.
NELL=>But what about you? Don't you ever help the others?
LONG=>Why should we help? We are the people of the pillar.
LONG=>A card?
NELL=>Wait.
NELL=>I can't play with that going on. May I have the candle?
LONG=>Be careful of the straw.
NELL=>Do your, chains hurt you?
NELL=>Where does it hurt?
NELL=>Here?
NELL=>Would it help if I put a bit of cloth there to ease the chain?
NELL=>Better?
LONG=>He's quiet now. That was kind of you.
NELL=>It's just that I don't care for sad music with my game of paroli. Let us play.
LONG=>A card?
NELL=>Five pounds.
LONG=>Any others?
SIMS=>A very pleasant group you make, dear people.
SIMS=>It's so nice to find you here among the upper classes, Mistress Bowen. But then it is exactly where I expected you to be. It's a law of physics -- the lighter elements, like scum, rise to the top.
NELL=>I thank you, Master Sims -- a delicate compliment —-
SIMS=>I see that you have joined what little we have of society -- the group around the pillar. Is this the brotherhood your Quaker friend preaches? Or perhaps you're afraid among the rest — those dark shadows I see about me --
NELL=>I'm not afraid.
SIMS=>Then you've forgotten.
NELL=>Forgotten what?
SIMS=>Forgotten that you were going to reform Bedlam -- cleanliness and soft beds for the delight of the patients -- good treatment — Well, you've been here a week, Mistress Bowen and your only friends are these — our nobility. The brotherhood of man --
NELL=>And give me clean straw -- I'll make beds for them. Bandages — and I'll bind their wounds — water and soap --
SIMS=>That would delight me to too. You shall have water -- you shall have soap -- you shall have straw enough. I hope you make good use of it.
NELL=>I shall. Never fear.
SIMS=>But now I leave you to dream about these Augean labors. May you find your dreams sweet and cleanly.
GRAY'S VOICE=>But where is it — you promised a chapter for today.
GRAY=>I appeal to you. Master Long — is it fair? I support his family — feed his children — even pay my tupence to come in and get my script and it is not ready.
LONG=>We've been busy. We've been helping Mistress Bowen.
GRAY=>Mistress Bowen — who is she?
GRAY=>Oh - a new female warder -- now about a next chapter —
LONG=>Not a warder, Master Gray -- an inmate like ourselves who does all she can to help her fellow sufferers.
GRAY=>What can she do?
LONG=>Look, I'll show you.
LONG'S VOICE=>What can she do you ask? She can feed those who have not wit enough to feed themselves -- she can wash the helpless — cheer, the despondent — she can -- she is an angel in this darkness.
GRAY=>Very interesting -- but this book you have — those drawings-
LONG=>Oh -- the pictures — you don't half their wonder, Master Gray — If I could only get a light behind these pages I could throw them large as life up on the wall.
GRAY=>Aye —- that's not a bad notion one could charge admission. You could even tell the story Todd's writing that way.
LONG=>You forget -- it's because of these pictures that I'm here -- that and because I'm the best lawyer in England, I, the most skilled of them all.
GRAY=>Oh, yes, that's true.
GRAY=>And you, Oliver — You'd best finish that chapter by tomorrow or I'll withdraw my support from your family. Understand?
NELL=>Dan, did you chance to see a trowel?
DAN=>A trowel? I'll build you a wall — a wall that high.
NELL=>Master Long, have you seen a trowel?
LONG=>I beg your pardon.
NELL=>A trowel — a mason's instrument. I mislaid it some days ago. I'd like it back.
LONG=>Oh, yes -- a trowel.
NELL=>I'm not mad, Master Long. I had a trowel.
LONG=>Oh, certainly, Mistress Bowen. We'll help you find it.
NELL=>You think I'm mad. Sometimes I think I've gone mad myself, scrubbing and making beds and all for people who don't even know that I'm trying to help them.
LONG=>They know.
SIMS=>Good morning, Mistress Bowen —
SIMS=>What a happy place this has become. Everything is so much cleaner -- the idiots even have their faces washed. Only a little time and this wonderful change in Bedlam! What wonders will you not accomplish in a life time.
SIMS=>Madame, you are to be congratulated.
NELL=>What do you want?
SIMS=>I want only to reward you. Didn't you ask for a separate sleeping apartment?
NELL=>I'd like to sleep in peace,. The main room is noisy at night.
SIMS=>And I have a room for you -- a prettier chamber -- if you will come with me --
SIMS=>Unfortunately, you will have to share this comfortable apartment with one other. I'm sure you won't mind that
NELL=>Better one than a hundred.
SIMS=>This is your new chamber, my dear lady.
SIMS=>Won't you enter?
NELL=>You've not driven me mad yet, Sims. I would not go in there.
SIMS=>And I wanted so much to please you-
SIMS=>Wait. This was to show you — that all those mawkish theories you've learned from the Quaker are lies. Men are not brothers — men are not born kind and good — even the mindless ones are savage and must be ruled with force.
NELL=>I know your thoughts on the matter, Sims, they do not interest me.
SIMS=>With the others, yes, you could prove the little value of gentleness — but look at this man -- look at him and tell me that kind words and tender deeds can rule him -- look!
NELL=>I am looking — it proves nothing.
SIMS=>But you don't dare enter the cage with him -- that proves much -- that proves the falseness of all that you have come to believe.
SIMS=>Well, then, enter the cage, gentle him with a word -- conquer him with kindness -- or admit that your Quaker lies.
SIMS=>You would enter.
NELL=>My friend, you do not wish to hurt me, nor I you.
NELL=>Perhaps you would like to talk. I will listen to you.
NELL=>I know -- you are trying to remember — some day you will.
NELL=>You will remember -- some day you will remember.
JOHN WILKES=>Citizen and Joiner, to be Chamberlain He having more creditors than any other person.
VARNEY=>— and the bailiff came. She went with him to Bedlam.
WILKES=>Apparently Sims fears an investigation. Men have rid themselves of unwanted wives by that sweet expedient but it takes Sims to forestall criticism with imprisonment.
HANNAY=>I will not believe such ill even of him — but she is there. I have spoken with her. She's as sane as thee or me.
WILKES=>Mistress Nell with that bright, quick mind of hers -- saner than either a politician or a Quaker. This is still England, Hannay, and we have laws here — laws of right and justice. I shall see that Sims feels their full weight,
WILKES=>We'll have Nell out of Bedlam in a twinkle -- never fear --
FIRST MANIAC=>Let Hull, house of Hull rejoice with Subis a bird called the Spight which, breaks the eagle's eggs. Let Scroop, house of Scroop rejoice with Fig-Wine-Palmi primarium vinum. Not so - Palrai-primum is the word. Let Hollingstead, house of Hollingstead rejoice with Sissitietaeris herb of good fellowship. Praise the name of the Lord September 1762.
SECOND MANIAC=>That's not right -- that's not right -- that's not the word of Truth -- the word of Truth is peace.
NELL=>Oh, Wallace — Edward — Stop!
SECOND MANIAC=>We were fighting over the word peace.
NELL=>Wiser men than you have fought about it, Edward.
SIMS' VOICE=>Mistress Bowen --
SIMS=>— a word with you.
SIMS=>I have good news.
SIMS=>You are to have a new hearing before the commission.
NELL=>When?
SIMS=>When it pleases the Commission.
SIMS=>It will please them to have your hearing tomorrow afternoon. I'm delighted for your sake.
SIMS=>Indeed, I am so pleased -- you've so endeared yourself to me -- that I want to do everything possible to make sure your hearing is a success -- that you will be released --
NELL=>Thank you.
SIMS=>In fact, I have ordered our most beneficient remedy for you.
NELL=>A remedy, Master Sims?
SIMS=>Have they -- not told you?
SIMS=>It is my own invention -- a cure -- a specific for the lax and wandering mind.
SIMS=>Look at him. When he came here he had but one concern -- to remember something he had forgotten -- I tried to help him with my remedy --
SIMS=>Perhaps I was not drastic enough.
NELL=>I need no cure.
SIMS=>Just to be sure, Mistress Bowen.
NELL=>No.
SIMS=>I've given you an invitation. Now I must speak as your physician. Come with me.
NELL=>I'll take my chances with the Commissioners. I need no cure,
SIMS=>As the Apothecary General of Bedlam, I order you.
NELL=>No!
SIMS=>If you insist upon it, I must force you.
NELL=>Force me? Here? Look around you.
SIMS=>Do you think your friends will help you?
NELL=>I have helped them.
SIMS=>You expect them to band together and overwhelm me. If they could reason so, they would not be here.
NELL=>I warn you. They know me. They know that I've helped them -- been kind to them --
SIMS=>And so they love you and will aid you -- again that Quaker nonsense --
SIMS=>Let go of me.
LONG=>Hold him.
SIMS=>Warders -- help -- warders --
NELL=>Shout away, Master Sims. Shout away. Your men are used to Bedlam and its noises -- they have heard too many cries to pay attention to one.
NELL=>As for me, I'll just borrow your keys, Master Sims.
TODD=>No — Mistress Bowen — not that way. There's a warder in the hall and another at the front door.
NELL=>But you heard him threaten me with the treatment. I can't stay here.
TODD=>There's a little window that is left unbarred —
NELL=>I think I know that window, Master Todd. You are mad if you think I'll try to climb through that window as Colby did, and others before him, I dare say.
TODD=>I'm not mad, Mistress Bowen — I'm not like the others here. I've been placed here, by my family to keep me from drink - so that I may write and support them. I know that little window is dangerous -- designed for a death trap -- but those who tried before were men of small strength.
NELL=>I'm no Hercules
TODD=>Tom could lift you through that window.
TODD=>You can go through that door
SIMS=>Long — you've more reason than the rest and I expect more from you — you know that there are chains to bind you and rods to beat out the punishment you'll get for this. You understand that don't you?
SIMS=>Then go to the door — call the warders for me -- or else you'll feel the weight of those chains and the bite of the rods on your back.
SIMS=>Do as I say.
LONG=>But the rest — what will they do to me?
SIMS=>Are you afraid of their vengeance? They couldn't think far enough ahead for that. They are lunatics. They have been tried and found incompetent by fair trial.
LONG=>Trial? Quo Warranto — corpus delicti — cum grano salis.
SIMS=>Ah yes, I'd forgotten you were a lawyer.
LONG=>A lawyer, air? I am a Judge. I am a judge — I, the most skilled of them all — and you shall be judged — judged I say.
LONG=>Bailiffs, hold that man! He disturbs the court.
WOMAN=>Try him — try him,
MAN=>A fair trial for Master Sims —- a fair trial —
SIMS=>Mistress Bowen — speak to them -- please speak to them -- I beseech you.
NELL=>Give Master Sims a fair trial.
NELL=>Tom -- you must get up on the roof. You are to go first, then you must pull me up — up — you understand?
NELL=>Tom.
NELL=>Tom —
NELL=>Tom — Tom —
NELL=>Tom — Tom —
IDIOT=>I am Solomon the Wise -- split him in two -- split him in two.
LONG=>And so, Milords, we have brought this man before you to answer for those crimes — these crimes which I shall number for you — neglect —
LONG=>-- cruelty —-
LONG=>— whippings — beatings — dirty straw to lie upon —
LONG=>A great shout rises and above it can be heard the clanking of the chains from those still fastened to the walls
LONG=>Starvation -- stealing our food — for all these crimes, Milords and Gentlemen of the Jury, I ask Justice.
SIMS=>I beg you — let me speak — lot me talk.
NELL=>William —
HANNAY=>Shh. This is God's house.
NELL=>I broke free from Bedlam.
HANNAY=>But thee should not have run from there -- thee were to have a new hearing tomorrow.
NELL=>If I lived that long. He had some treatment that he was to give me — a treatment that made even the maddest of them shudder to hear -- I ran --and they have him now.
HANNAY=>Who has him?
NELL=>The loonies — they've seized him and are trying him in mockery-- they will kill him. It is what he deserves.
HANNAY=>Hush. Thee should not speak of any man that way. Have they killed him?
NELL=>They will — they will --
HANNAY=>Then thee must go to him. Thee must speak to the poor afflicted ones and save him.
NELL=>Save him?
HANNAY=>Can one know his mind? Can one know what sickness lies in it? As thee were kind to those in Bedlam, thee must be kind to those whose sickness forces them to hurt their fellow man.
HANNAY=>Is it not the same thing? Has Sims not a madness thee can pity?
HANNAY=>Come -- we shall get Wilkes — he will help us —
SIMS=>I did not want to hurt you. I did not want to put chains on you — to starve you --to steal from you.
LONG=>But you did. And now it is our turn.
SIMS=>You will not dare harm me. They'll load you with chains, scourge you with the cat. Then you shall really know what cruelty can be. I warn you.
TODD=>Your vengeance is not our present concern. What you have done concerns us -- why you did it.
SIMS=>I told you -- I had to -- even as you do things because you have to do them -- even when you know they're wrong --
LONG=>But why?
SIMS=>Can't you understand? This is a great world and strong men with great advantages rule over it and men like me are frightened -- born poor and misshapen —
TODD=>Did you beat us out of fright Sims did you starve us out of fear?
SOLOMON=>Split him in two.
LONG=>Is that why you still threaten us if harm comes to you?
SIMS=>I warn you -- the chains —- the rods —
TODD=>You spoke of your fear —
SIMS=>It is a great world -- a world of force and pomp and power —- and I was frightened at my littleness - my ugliness and my poverty.
TODD=>And for that you struck and starved
SIMS=>It is the frightened dog that bites -- and I had to fawn and toady and make a mock of myself so that all I could hear was the world laughing at my ugliness, I was afraid.
TODD=>You had to strike us.
SIMS=>Yes -- yes -- can't you understand?
TODD=>I understand.
SOLOMON=>Split him in two.
LONG=>And our punishment —
SIMS=>Let me go. There will be no punishment.
TODD=>He is sane. There is a fear in him — a fear that strikes out -- that claws and tears at the world like a singed cat. He is sane.
LONG=>He will not punish us. He is sane.
JUDGE=>This man is sane.
SOLOMON=>Split him in two.
LONG=>Wait -- wait.
LONG=>This man has been judged sane -- he has no place here — he must leave -- you cannot harm him -- it is the order of the court that he is sane and that he shall be free.
LONG=>Bailiffs, release the prisoner!
LONG=>They will punish all of us. The Apothecary General is dead.
LONG'S VOICE=>We must hide him —— somewhere we must hide him -- so that they will never know --
NELL=>-- and when we got here, Master Wilkes, he was gone. Long said he just left -- disappeared —-
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>That is all I can get out of Long, but I know they must have killed him.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>But it's so preposterous, Master Wilkes — a man like Sims doesn't just disappear.
WILKES=>-— and that's precisely why he disappeared. They tried him, found him guilty of sanity and let him go. Can you imagine what was in his mind -- the mind of this man who had sworn on all that was holy to aid and comfort these people -- can you imagine his feeling of guilt? I think that is what drove him to run away.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>They killed him.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>-- killed him and hid his body somewhere --
WILKES=>You can't prove that without finding his body.
CHIEF COMMISSIONER=>.......We shall find it and we shall punish them.
WILKES=>Yes, I know -— the chains -- the beatings -- I tell you it's no good. What you need here is a better man to fill the post that Sims has fled from — and after him a better man and so on until things here are as they should be; all kindness and care for these poor sick ones,
NELL=>You're not going to tell them. You know what It means to the people in there. Is it not worth silence to save them suffering?
HANNAY=>I must tell the truth.
NELL=>But no one has asked you.
NELL=>I have heard there was much rejoicing in,Heaven for the lost lamb that comes back to the fold.
HANNAY=>Let me pass, Nell. I must tell them.
NELL=>With only a little silence you can win a lost lamb for the fold, Master Hannay. If you speak you gain nothing but suffering for those in there.
NELL=>They have not asked thee. Thou hast no need to affirm and why should thy hand be added to the weight that those people in there must bear. Is that God's Will?
HANNAY=>Are we lovers that you thee and thou me?
