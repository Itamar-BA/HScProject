FARHAN=>Hello... Yes?
FARHAN=>What?
AIR HOSTESS=>Sir, kindly switch off your mobile phone.
FARHAN=>Just one sec, please, one sec, please.
FARHAN=>Excuse me.
FARHAN=>Excuse me.
AIR HOSTESS=>Sir, please sit down.
AIR HOSTESS=>Captain, there’s a medical emergency. A passenger has just fallen down in the aisle.
CAPTAIN=>Delhi, Air India 101 returning due to medical emergency.
AIR HOSTESS=>Excuse me Sir. Sir, excuse me. Sir, excuse me Sir.
FARHAN=>Hold on!
FARHAN=>I’m ﬁ ne now, thanks. Carry on, please. I will go.
MEDICAL STAFF=>Gentleman, wait!
FARHAN=>Get the cab yaar!
DRIVER=>Mr. Dhillon?
FARHAN=>Want the name tattooed? Get the car fast man!
DRIVER=>To the hotel, Sir?
FARHAN=>Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar.
FARHAN=>Step on the gas, dude!
RAJU=>Yeah, Farhan?
FARHAN=>Get ready. I’ll pick you up in five minutes.
RAJU=>What happened?
FARHAN=>Chatur called. Remember him?
RAJU=>Who? ‘Silencer’?
FARHAN=>Yeah. He said Rancho is coming.
FARHAN=>He said: If you want to meet Rancho come to the campus at 8. On the tank.
RAJU=>What?
FARHAN=>Hurry!
RAJU=>Ok.

RAJU=>We found our buddy.
RAJU=>What?
RAJU=>I will talk after coming back – bye.
SOONI=>You forgot your pants.
DRIVER=>Now to the hotel, Sir?
FARHAN=>Yes,but via Imperial College of Engineering.
DRIVER=>Ok, Sir.
RAJU=>Forgot my socks.
RAJU=>Oh no!
FARHAN=>More than just your socks. Your pants.
FARHAN=>Now get my brother from the airport. Same last name – Dhillon.
HARBHAJAN SINGH DHILLON=>This is Dhillon. Where’s my cab? On the runway?
FARHAN=>Hey Rancho.
RAJU=>Hey Chatur, where’s Rancho?
FARHAN=>Where’s Rancho?
CHATUR=>Welcome, idiots.
CHATUR=>Have a drink. jktw vjs jSUpks dgk¡ gS ;kj\
CHATUR=>Some ‘madeira’ for you? The same rum you guzzled those days.
RAJU=>Where is Rancho?
CHATUR=>I will tell you. First look at this.
CHATUR=>Don’t eye my wife. Check out the mansion behind, idiots, $ 3.5 million.
CHATUR=>Swimming pool – heated. Living room – maple wood ﬂ ooring.
CHATUR=>My new Lambhorghini 6496cc – very fast!
FARHAN=>Why’re you showing us all this?
CHATUR=>Forgot?
CHATUR=>What’s this?
RAJU=>‘5th September’. Today’s date. What else?

CHATUR=>I challenge you. We’ll meet again after ten years. Same day. Same place. We’ll see who’s more successful. Have the balls? C’mon, bet!
CHATUR=>Remember? I’d challenged that idiot right here. I kept my promise. I’m back.
FARHAN=>Jackass! I aborted a ﬂ ight, he forgot his pants all to meet Rancho. Five years we’ve searched. Don’t even know if he’s alive. And you think he’ll show up for your silly bet.
CHATUR=>I know he won’t show up.
FARHAN=>You gonna break his jaw or should I?
RAJU=>So why did you call us here?
CHATUR=>To meet Rancho. Come and see where I’ve reached and where he rots.
RAJU=>So you know where Rancho is?
CHATUR=>Yes.
FARHAN=>Where?
CHATUR=>He is in Shimla.
FARHAN=>Rancho. Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad. He was as unique as his name. From birth we were taught – life is a race. Run fast or you’ll be trampled.
FARHAN=>Even to be born, one had to race 300 million sperms.
FARHAN=>1978. I was born at 5.15 pm.
FARHAN=>At 5.16, my father announced ...
FARHAN’S FATHER=>My son will be an engineer.
FARHAN’S AUNTY=>Farhan Qureshi. B.Tech. Engineer.
FARHAN=>And my fate was sealed.
MANMOHAN, AKA MILLIMETER,=>a street-smart 12 year old, comes up behind him.
FARHAN=>What I wanted to be ... no one asked.
FARHAN=>Raju Rastogi, Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
FARHAN=>D-26.
MILLIMETER=>Room number?
MILLIMETER=>C’mon.
MILLIMETER=>I’m Man Mohan. M.M. These engineers call me Millimeter. For eggs, bread, milk, laundry, ﬁ nishing journals, copying assignments, I’m your guy. Fixed rates. No bargaining.
FARHAN=>Hey wait, hold this.
MILLIMETER=>Meet Kilobyte, Megabyte, and their mother Gigabyte. Go ahead, click – this family doesn’t bite.
MILLIMETER=>Check him out ... another god-fearing soul.
FARHAN=>Hi. Farhan Qureshi.
RAJU=>I’m Raju Rastogi.
MILLIMETER=>Don’t worry, a few days here and he’ll lose faith in God. Then naked babes will be on the wall, and he’ll say – “Oh God, give me one chance with her”.
RAJU=>Get out of here.
MILLIMETER=>Four bucks. Two per bag.
FARHAN=>Here’s ﬁ ve. Keep the change.
MILLIMETER=>Thanks boss. For your tip, here’s one in return – wear your best underwear tonight.
RAJU=>Why?
ALL STUDENTS=>Your Majesty, Thou art great.
ALL STUDENTS=>Accept this humble offering.
FARHAN=>A campus tradition – on Day 1. Freshmen must pay their respects to seniors in their underwear. This is when we first saw Rancho.
RAGGING SENIOR=>Spiderman, Batman.
RANCHO=>Aal izz well ... aal izz well.
RANCHO=>Aal izz well ... aal izz well.
CHATUR=>Take off your pants or they are going to piss on you. jSfxax lhfu;j 1 vks, vaxzst] fgUnh cksyus esa 'keZ vkrh gS\
CHATUR=>Sorry Sir, I was born in Uganda, studied in Pondicherry, so little slow in Hindi. jSfxax lhfu;j 1 rks Lyksyh le>k uk blsA tYnh fdldks gSA
FARHAN=>What did he say?
CHATUR=>Pray undress or he’ll do ‘urine-expulsion’ on you.
FARHAN=>Salt water is a great conductor of electricity. 8th-grade-physics. We had studied it. He applied it.
FARHAN=>Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe was the Director of ICE. Students called him Virus, computer Virus.
MILLIMETER=>Virus is on the way, with eggs. First year students are summoned. Come quickly.
FARHAN=>Virus was the most competitive man we had ever seen.
FARHAN=>He couldn’t bear anyone getting ahead of him.
FARHAN=>To save time, his shirts had Velcro and his ties had hooks.
FARHAN=>He’d trained his mind to write with both hands simultaneously.
FARHAN=>Everyday at 2 pm he took a 7½ minute power nap with an opera as lullaby. Govind, his valet, had instructions to carry out all unproductive tasks such as shaving, nail- cutting, etc. during this time.
CHATUR=>Sir, nest. MkbjsDVj fdldk\
DIRECTOR=>Wrong.
DIRECTOR=>What is this?
DIRECTOR=>Whose?
CHATUR=>Koel bird’s nest, Sir.
DIRECTOR=>A koel bird never makes her own nest. She lays her eggs in other nests.
DIRECTOR=>And when they hatch, what do they do?
DIRECTOR=>They push the other eggs out of the nest.
DIRECTOR=>Competition over. Their life begins with murder. That’s nature. Compete or die.
DIRECTOR=>You also are like the koel birds.
DIRECTOR=>And these are the eggs you pushed to get into ICE.
DIRECTOR=>And these? Finished. Broken eggs. My son ... he tried for three years.
DIRECTOR=>... Rejected. Every time. Remember, life is a race. If you don’t run fast, you’ll get trampled.
DIRECTOR=>Let me tell you a very interesting story. This is an astronaut’s pen. Fountain pens and ballpoint pens don’t work in outer space. So scientists spent millions to invent this pen. It can write at any angle, in any temperature, in zero gravity.
DIRECTOR=>One day, when I was a student, the Director of our institute called me. He said, “Viru Sahastrabuddhe.” I said, “Yes Sir” “Come here!” Main darr gaya. He showed me this pen. He said, “This is a symbol of excellence. I give it to you. Aur jis din tumhe tumahre jaisa koi extraordinary student mile, to yeh pen usse paas on kar dena.” A beat.
DIRECTOR=>Battis saal se Viru Sahastrabuddhe is waiting for that student. But no luck. Anyone here, who’ll strive to win this pen?
DIRECTOR=>Good. Put your hands down.
DIRECTOR=>Shall I post it on the notice board? Hands down. jSUpks lj] esjk ,d loky gS ljA
RANCHO=>One question, Sir.
RANCHO=>Sir, if pens didn’t work in outer space why didn’t the astronauts use a pencil? They’d have saved millions.
RAJU=>He zaps a senior’s privates at night. Fingers the Director in the day. Best avoid him.
MILLIMETER=>You deﬂ ated Virus’s erection. Your Majesty, thou art great. Accept this humble offering
DIRECTOR=>I will get back to you on this.
RAJU=>Buzz off. You don’t have school?
MILLIMETER=>Who’ll pay for it? Your pop?
RAJU=>Keep off my dad! You ...
RANCHO=>Relax.
FARHAN=>Raju, what are you doing!
RANCHO=>For school you don’t need any money. You need a uniform.
RANCHO=>Pick a school, buy the uniform and slip into class. In so much of a crowd, no one will notice.
MILLIMETER=>If I get caught?
RANCHO=>Then new uniform, new school.
RAJU=>See that?
FARHAN=>He was different... He challenged conventions at every stage. A free-spirited bird had landed in Virus’s nest. We were robots, blindly following our professors’ commands. He was the only one who was not a machine.
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>What is a machine?
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>What’re you smiling for?
RANCHO=>Sir, to study engineering was a childhood dream. I’m so happy to be here ﬁ nally.
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>No need to be so happy.
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>Deﬁ ne a machine.
RANCHO=>Anything that simpliﬁ es work, or saves time, is a machine.
RANCHO=>It’s a warm day, press a button, get a blast of air. The fan ... a machine!
RANCHO=>A machine is anything that reduces human effort.
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>Will you please elaborate?
RANCHO=>Speak to a friend miles away. The telephone ... a machine!
RANCHO=>Compute millions in seconds. The calculator ... a machine! We’re surrounded by machines. From a pen’s nib to a pants’ zip – all machines.
RANCHO=>Up and down in a second. Up, down, up, down...
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>What is the deﬁ nition?
RANCHO=>I just gave it to you, Sir.
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>You’ll write this in the exam? This is a machine – up, down ... idiot! Anybody else?
PROFESSOR=>Yes?
CHATUR=>Sir, machines are any combination of bodies so connected that their relative motions are constrained and by which means, force and motion may be transmitted and modiﬁ ed as a screw and its nut, or a lever arranged to turn about a fulcrum or a pulley about its pivot, etc., especially, a construction, more or less complex consisting of a combination of moving parts, or simple mechanical elements, as wheels, levers, cams, etc.
CHATUR=>Thank you ... Thank you.
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>Wonderful. Perfect. Please sit down.
RANCHO=>But Sir, I said the same thing, in simple language.
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>If you prefer simple language, join an Arts and Commerce college.
RANCHO=>But Sir, one must get the meaning too ... What’s the point of blindly cramming a bookish deﬁ nition?
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>You think you’re smarter than the book? Write the textbook deﬁ nition, mister, if you want to pass.
RANCHO=>But there are other books ...
PROFESSOR=>In simple language – out!
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>Get out!
RANCHO=>Why? izksQslj vklku Hkk”"kk esa ckgj tkb;sA
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>Idiot!
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>So, we were discussing the machine ... Why’re you back?
RANCHO=>Instruments that record, analyse, summarise, organise, debate and explain information; that are illustrated, non-illustrated, hard- bound, paperback, jacketed, non-jacketed; with foreword, introduction, table-of- contents, index; that are intended for the enlightenment, understanding, enrichment, enhancement and education of the human brain through the sensory route of vision. Sometimes touch.
RANCHO=>I forgot something.
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>What?
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>What do you mean?
RANCHO=>Books, Sir
RANCHO=>I forgot my books. May I?
PROFESSOR POTDAR=>Couldn’t you ask simply?
RANCHO=>I tried earlier, Sir. It simply didn’t work.
FARHAN=>Professors kept Rancho mostly out. ... Seldom in, when thrown out of one class, he’d slip into another. He said – “First year or fourth year, it’s knowledge. Just grab it.” He was unlike any of us. We fought for a shower every morning. He’d bathe wherever he found water.

RANCHO=>Morning Sir!
JOY=>Sir. Excuse me, Sir.
FARHAN=>Machines were his passion. When he spotted them, he opened them. Some he could re-assemble ... some he couldn’t.
FARHAN=>There was another, just like him, Joy Lobo.
DIRECTOR=>Mr. Joy Lobo.
JOY=>Sir, if I could know the convocation dates ...
DIRECTOR=>Why?
JOY=>Actually, Dad wants to make train reservations. I’m the ﬁ rst engineer from my village. Everyone wants to attend.
DIRECTOR=>In that case, call your dad please.
DIRECTOR=>Come, please, please. Hurry up. Don’t waste my time.
JOY’S FATHER=>Hello.
JOY=>Dad, the Director wants to speak to you.
JOY’S FATHER=>Joy.
DIRECTOR=>Mr. Lobo, your son won’t graduate this year.
JOY’S FATHER=>What happened, Sir?
DIRECTOR=>He has violated all deadlines. Mr. Lobo, it’s an unrealistic project. He’s making some nonsense helicopter. I suggest you don’t book your tickets. I’m so sorry.
JOY=>Sir, I am this close, Sir.
DIRECTOR=>Is your project ready?
JOY=>I ...
DIRECTOR=>Is your project ready? TkkW; lj] vki ,d nQ+k ns[k rks yhft, lj] Iyht+
DIRECTOR=>Why! Why should I give you an extension?
JOY=>Sir, see it once, please.
DIRECTOR=>Submit it, and we’ll consider.
JOY=>Sir, a small extension ...
JOY=>After Dad’s stroke, I couldn’t focus for two months.
DIRECTOR=>Did you stop eating for two months?
DIRECTOR=>Stopped bathing?
JOY=>No.
JOY=>No.
DIRECTOR=>So why did you stop studying?
JOY=>Sir, I’m very close. See it once, please ...
DIRECTOR=>Mr. Lobo! Sunday afternoon, my son fell off a train and died. Monday morning, I taught a class. So don’t give me that nonsense.
DIRECTOR=>I can give you sympathy, not an extension, I’m sorry.
JOY=>Sir … I’m very close ...
RANCHO=>Dude’s come up with an amazing design. A wireless camera atop a helicopter. Can be used for trafﬁ c updates, security ... Wow!
FARHAN=>But Virus said it’s an impractical design, it won’t ﬂ y.
RANCHO=>It will ﬂ y! We’ll make it ﬂ y. Don’t tell Joy. It’ll be a surprise. We’ll ﬂ y it up to his window and capture his reaction.
RAJU=>If we work on his project, who’ll work on ours? Tests, vivas, quizzes – 42 exams per semester.
RANCHO=>You scare easily, bro. Take your hand, put it over your heart, and say, “aal izz well”.
RAJU=>Aal izz well?
RANCHO=>Aal izz well.
FARHAN=>New words of wisdom from his Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas.
RANCHO=>We had an old watchman in our village. On night patrol, he’d call out, “aal izz well”.
RANCHO=>And we slept peacefully. Then there was a theft and we learned that he couldn’t see at night! He’d just yell “Aal izz well”, and we felt secure. That day I understood this heart scares easily. You have to trick it. However big the problem, tell your heart, “Aal izz well, pal”.
RAJU=>Yes. That resolves the problem?
RANCHO=>No. But you gain courage to face iat.
RANCHO=>We’re gonna really need the mantra. Learn it.
RANCHO=>Got it, got it … yes ….
FARHAN=>Hey, take it up to Joy’s window.
RAJU=>Hey Joy.
FARHAN=>Take it higher.
RAJU=>Look at Silencer – the nude dude!
RAJU=>Joy, come out.
FARHAN=>Hey Joy, come to the window.
RAJU=>Joy, look outside.
RAJU=>JOY … JOY …
PRIEST=>We commend our brother Joy to the Lord. May the Lord receive him into his peace and raise up his body on the ﬁ nal day.
PRIEST=>Let us pray for our brother Joy to our lord Jesus Christ who said “I’m the resurrection and the life. The man who believes in me will live even if he dies. And every living person who puts his faith in me will never suffer eternal death …”.
RANCHO=>Good news, Sir The police and Joy’s father have no clue. Everyone thinks this is suicide.
RANCHO=>The post mortem report – Cause of Death: Intense pressure on windpipe resulting in choking.
RANCHO=>All think the pressure on the jugular killed him. What about the mental pressure for the last four years? That’s missing in the report.
RANCHO=>Engineers are a clever bunch. They will never make a machine to measure mental pressure.
RANCHO=>If they had, all would know ... this isn’t suicide ... it’s murder, Sir.
DIRECTOR=>How dare you blame me for Joy’s suicide? If one student can’t handle pressure, is it our fault? Life is full of pressures. Will you always blame others for pressure in life?
RANCHO=>I don’t blame you, Sir. I blame the system. Look at these statistics – India ranks No.1 in suicides. Every 90 minutes, a student attempts suicide. Suicide is a bigger killer than disease. Something’s terribly wrong, Sir.
DIRECTOR=>I can’t speak for the rest but this is one of the ﬁ nest colleges in the country. I’ve run this place for 32 years. We were ranked 28th. Now we’re No. 1.
RANCHO=>What’s the point, Sir? Here they don’t discuss new ideas or inventions. They discuss grades, jobs, settling in USA. They teach how to get good scores. They don’t teach engineering.
DIRECTOR=>Now you will teach me how to teach?
RANCHO=>Sir, Sir my paper …
RANCHO=>No Sir, I ...
DIRECTOR=>Vaidyanathan, please sit down.
DIRECTOR=>Here is a self-proclaimed professor who thinks he is better than our highly qualiﬁ ed teacher. Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad will teach us engineering.
DIRECTOR=>We do not have all day.
RANCHO=>You have 30 seconds to deﬁ ne the terms. written.
RANCHO=>You may refer to your books. Raise your hand if you get the answer. Let’s see who comes ﬁ rst, who comes last. Your time starts ... now.
CHATUR=>Give me this!
RANCHO=>Time up.
RANCHO=>No one got the answer? Now rewind your life by a minute. When I asked this question, were you excited? Curious? Thrilled that you’d learn something new? Anyone? ... Sir? No. You all got into a frantic race. What’s the use of such methods, even if you come ﬁ rst. Will your knowledge increase? No, just the pressure. This is a college, not a pressure cooker.
RANCHO=>Even a circus lion learns to sit on a chair in fear of the whip. But you call such a lion ‘well trained’, not ‘well educated’.
DIRECTOR=>Hello! This is not a philosophy class. Just explain those two words.
RANCHO=>Sir, these words don’t exist.
RANCHO=>These are my friends’ names. Farhan and Raju.
DIRECTOR=>Quiet! Nonsense! Is this how you’ll teach engineering?
RANCHO=>Sir, I wasn’t teaching you engineering. You’re an expert at that.
RANCHO=>I was teaching you ... how to teach.
RANCHO=>And I’m sure one day you’ll learn because unlike you, I never abandon my weak students.
DIRECTOR=>Quiet! Quiet, I said!
RANCHO=>Bye, Sir!
DIRECTOR=>Farhan.
DIRECTOR=>Raju.
DIRECTOR=>I regret to inform you that your son ...
DIRECTOR=>– have fallen into bad company. Without urgent corrective steps, his future will be ruined.
FARHAN=>Virus’s letters dropped on our homes like atom bombs. Hiroshima and Nagasaki plunged into gloom. Our parents invited us for a dressing down.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Come in. See that? We could afford just one air-conditioner We put it in Farhan’s room, so he could study in comfort. I didn’t buy a car. I managed with a scooter. We put all our money into Farhan’s education. We sacriﬁ ced our comforts for Farhan’s future. Understand?
FARHAN’S FATHER=>And after that when I get such a letter from the Principal, can you imagine how I must have felt?
RANCHO=>You took these pictures, Farhan?
FARHAN’S FATHER=>He was obsessed with photography for a while. Went around taking pictures of animals. Wanted to be a wildlife photographer. Son, what was your score that year? Tell.
FARHAN=>91%.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Hear that? Straight drop from 94% to 91%.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>You ﬁ nd it funny?
RANCHO=>No Sir, sorry. I’m just amazed at the photos. Why make him an engineer ...? Why not a wildlife photographer?

FARHAN’S MOTHER=>Food’s on the table, boys.
FARHAN=>C’mon, let’s eat
FARHAN’S FATHER=>If you ever visit again, do eat with us.
FARHAN=>Dad denied us a meal ... So, to ﬁ ll our bellies with food ... and ears with more reprimands, we reached Raju’s house.
FARHAN=>Raju’s house was straight out of a ’50s black and white ﬁ lm. A small, dingy room, a paralysed father, a coughing mother and an unwed sister. A sofa sprouting springs and a 24-hour water supply from the leaking roof. His mother was a retired school teacher and a tireless complainer. His father was once a postmaster. Paralysis shut down his body partly – and his salary completely. And the sister ...
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Kammo’s turned 28. They demand a Maruti 800 in dowry. If you don’t study and earn, how will she marry?
KAMMO=>Some lady’s ﬁ nger?
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Lady’s ﬁ nger is now Rs. 12/ per kilo, cauliﬂ ower is Rs. 10/.
RAJU’S MOTHER=>It’s daylight robbery! What will we eat if we get warnings from your college?
RAJU=>Mom!
KAMMO=>Cottage cheese?
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Cottage cheese should be sold at the jewellers, in velvet pouches.
KAMMO=>Cottage cheese?
FARHAN=>No, no, it’s ok. Thank you.
RAJU=>Mom, please.
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Alright, I’ll shut up.
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Earn for the family, slave like a maid and then take the vow of silence. If not
FARHAN=>Hey Raju.
FARHAN=>We were in a huge dilemma. Do we comfort our friend or console his mom? Screw it, we thought, let’s focus on the cottage cheese.
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Even his eczema cream costs Rs. 55/ now.
LATER=>The images on screen return to colour. Rancho, Farhan and Raju are walking down a street. Rancho suddenly starts laughing. jSUpks fHkUMh --- ckjg #i;s dh ---
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Another roti?
RANCHO=>Lady’s ﬁ nger for Rs. 12/.
FARHAN=>Cauliﬂ ower for Rs. 10/.
RAJU=>At least you were offered a meal. Unlike your sadistic dad ... ‘Hitler’ Qureshi!
FARHAN=>And your mom is Mother Teresa ... Feeding us ‘eczema roti’!
RAJU=>Don’t poke fun at my mom!
FARHAN=>Enough, Raju.
RANCHO=>I’m famished. Let’s eat out.
FARHAN=>It’s month end. Who’ll pay? His Mother Teresa?
RANCHO=>To eat out, you don’t need money. Just a uniform.
RANCHO=>Look ...
RANCHO=>C’mon!
FARHAN=>Come …
RANCHO=>Oh, Uncle!
RANCHO=>Three large vodkas.
FARHAN=>Half soda, half water.
RAJU=>If we’re caught, we’re dead.
RANCHO=>What’s for starters?
FARHAN=>Get double portions.
RANCHO=>Leave this here and start some peppy music.
SUHAS=>Why’re you wearing this ancient piece of junk? What’ll people say – “Suhas ﬁ ancée ... a doctor in the making, wearing a cheap, 200-rupee watch!” Please take it off. Thank you.

RANCHO=>He’ll turn your life into a nightmare of brands and prices.
AUNTY=>Oh my God!
RANCHO=>He’ll ruin your life. Your future will be ﬁ nished. Want a demonstration? Shall I ﬁ nd out the price of his shoes? I won’t ask. He’ll announce it himself. Just see. Hold.
SUHAS=>What the hell … Mint chutney on my $300 shoes!
RANCHO=>Run for your life! It’s free advice. Take it or leave it.
SUHAS=>Genuine Italian leather – hand stitched!

RANCHO=>It was my moral responsibility.
RANCHO=>Yes, yes.

RANCHO=>Certainly. Raju, the mint chutney.

RAJU=>Yes.
RANCHO=>Where is your daddy?
PIA=>Right behind you.
RANCHO=>Oh!
PIA=>Run for your life! It’s free advice. Take it or leave it.
DIRECTOR=>What’re you doing here?
RANCHO=>We’ll hand these gifts to the couple.
PIA=>I’ll do that for you. It’s my sister’s wedding.
RANCHO=>Oh sister! Sir, how many daughters do you have?
PIA=>Empty. No gift cheques.
RANCHO=>Forgot the cheques, Raju ... Farhan?
PIA=>We didn’t invite you. You must be from the groom’s side.
RANCHO=>No Sir, we’re here as the emissaries of science.
DIRECTOR=>How? Can you explain?
PIA=>Dad, he explains superbly. I’m sure he’ll give us a demo. Won’t you?
RANCHO=>Well, Delhi has plenty of power cuts that ... disrupt wedding celebrations. So I thought of making an inverter that ... draws power from guests’ cars.
DIRECTOR=>I see.
PIA=>Wow. So where’s the inverter?
RANCHO=>Sir, the design is ready.
FARHAN=>Hmm? jSUpks fMt+kbu fn;k Fkk uk rq>s\
RANCHO=>Where’s the design, Farhan?
RANCHO=>I gave you the design?
FARHAN=>I gave it to Raju.
RANCHO=>Raju, design?
RANCHO=>Never mind the design. I’ll make the inverter and show you.
DIRECTOR=>You can only invent stories, not an inverter.
RANCHO=>I’ll make one, I promise. And I’ll name it after you. After all, it was invented ... at your daughter’s wedding. So it’ll be an honour. ...
DIRECTOR=>Farhan, Raju. I’ll see you in my ofﬁ ce tomorrow ...
RAJU=>Sir, what was the cost per plate? We’ll reimburse you ... in installments.
FARHAN=>We’ll never gate-crash a wedding again..
RAJU=>Not even my own.
FARHAN=>In fact, I won’t even marry. Nor will he.
RAJU=>Uh ... right. No marriage.
DIRECTOR=>Your parents shouldn’t have married either.
DIRECTOR=>Pay attention.
DIRECTOR=>The world would have two less idiots to feed.
DIRECTOR=>Sit!
DIRECTOR=>This is Ranchhoddas’s father’s monthly income.
DIRECTOR=>Couple of zeroes less, and it’s still a sizeable income.
FARHAN=>Yes, Sir.
DIRECTOR=>But erase another zero, and I would worry a little. Isn’t that your father’s income, Farhan?
DIRECTOR=>Now take away another zero … and that’s your family income, Raju Rastogi … big reason to worry.
DIRECTOR=>Take my advice and shift into Chatur Ramalingam’s room. Exams are on you head. Stay with Chanchad and you’re sure to fail.
DIRECTOR=>Then get lost!
DIRECTOR=>Want a shave?
FARHAN=>No Sir.
RANCHO=>Raju, don’t worry. This is Virus’s move to split us. Divide and rule.
RAJU=>I have to worry. He grades us, and I need good grades for a good job. Unlike you, I don’t have a rich dad I can live off.
FARHAN=>What nonsense are you speaking, Raju?
RAJU=>Must we follow all his hogwash? “Aal izz well”... I won’t be his ﬂ unky ... like you.
FARHAN=>You’re crossing the line ...
RAJU=>No, I’m drawing one. I have a family to support.
RAJU=>Dad’s medicines swallow up Mom’s pension. My sister can’t marry because they want a car in dowry. Mom hasn’t bought a single saree in ﬁ ve years.
FARHAN=>Now don’t get your mom’s wardrobe into the debate.
RANCHO=>By the way, how many sarees per annum is reasonable?
RAJU=>Hey ... no wisecracks about Mom.
RANCHO=>We’ll study with all our heart, but not just for grades. To quote a Wise One – “Study to be accomplished, not afﬂ uent. Follow excellence. And success will chase you, pants down!”
RAJU=>Which Wise One says this? His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?
RAJU=>Go rot in the bogs!
FARHAN=>Raju, don’t stress. We’ll top our class. Nothing is impossible.
RAJU=>Nothing is impossible? Shove this back into the tube.
FARHAN=>Raju got onto another train. His travails with Chatur began. Yes, I mean travails, not travels.
FARHAN=>Chatur was called ‘Silencer’. To sharpen his memory, he popped pills from a local quack. And then let off silent ... but lethal farts.
CHATUR=>I didn’t do it ... Raju?
FARHAN=>He always blamed others for the output.
FARHAN=>Silencer crammed 18 hours a day. On exam eve, he would distract others.
FARHAN=>His belief – there are only two ways of topping. Elevate your own grades or lower your opponents’ grades.
FARHAN=>Rancho decided to subdue Silencer and rescue Raju ... with one master plan.
DUBEY=>Our Director has unceasingly served ... ‘Served’ means ...
CHATUR=>Damn the meaning, I’ll memorize it.
DUBEY=>Memorising parrot.
FARHAN=>Chatur was the introductory speaker, at the Teachers’ Day function. To impress Virus, he got his speech written by the librarian ... in high-brow Hindi.
CLERK=>Hello. Hold on. Chatur, call for you.
CHATUR=>Please collect the printout. I’ll be right back.
DUBEY=>Oh ... the things I have to do ...
RANCHO=>Mr. Dubey, the Director was remembering you.
DUBEY=>Really?
RANCHO=>Yes. Just now.
DUBEY=>I’ll see him right away. Give this to Chatur.
RANCHO=>Yes.
CHATUR=>Hello! Hello!
FARHAN=>Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?
CHATUR=>Yes?
FARHAN=>I’m calling from the police station. Are you from Uganda?
CHATUR=>Yes, Sir. Qjgku g---eA th] vkidh tku dks [krjk gSA
CHATUR=>What! How? Qjgku esjs bUlVªd'kUl /;ku ls lqfu,] ojuk dkWyst ds xsV ds ckgj fudyrs gh chp jksM esa vkidh ekSr gks tk,xhA
FARHAN=>Your life is in danger.
FARHAN=>Listen carefully, or else you’ll get killed as soon as you step out of the college gate.
CHATUR=>Why? What happened?
FARHAN=>While Chatur was kept engaged, Rancho altered a few words in his speech, for e.g., ‘served’ became ‘screwed’.
DUBEY=>Yes, Sir?
DIRECTOR=>Congratulations!
CHATUR=>Excuse me, Sir!
DIRECTOR=>Who are you?
DUBEY=>Dubey. Librarian. I’m permanent staff, Sir.
FARHAN=>Hold on a moment. The chief’s on the other line.
RANCHO=>Yes ... so where was I?
CHATUR=>You said I may die outside the gate.
CHATUR=>What nonsense! I know that! jSUpks vksg] ;w uks nSVA osjh xqM csVkA rc rks rqe lsQ gksA 'kkck'k 'kkck'k!
RANCHO=>Right. As you get out of the gate, you’ll see a trafﬁ c signal.
CHATUR=>Trafﬁ c signal. Ok. Ok.
RANCHO=>When it turns red, all the cars will halt.
CHATUR=>Ok … Ok. Then?
RANCHO=>Then cross the road with great caution. Because son, in rush hour if a car hits you, you’re dead.
RANCHO=>You know that? Excellent. Then you’re safe my boy.
RANCHO=>From the librarian, Silencer.
CHATUR=>You don’t call me that, Chanchad!
FARHAN=>Chanchad!
DUBEY=>Hey. The Director said he didn’t call for me.
RANCHO=>Who said ‘called’? I just said he ‘remembered’ you.
DUBEY=>Remembered? Rascals!
CHATUR=>He’s a great guy, really you are!
CHATUR=>Distinguished Mr. Chairperson.
CHATUR=>Chief Guest, the Honorable Minister of Education, respected teachers and friends, if ICE has now soared beyond the stratosphere, the credit goes solely to Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe!
DUBEY=>Sir, the voice is his but the words are mine.
CHATUR=>For 32 years, he has unceasingly screwed students.
RANCHO=>This means he has pulled off one wonder after another.
CHATUR=>I’m sure his endeavours will continue.
CHATUR=>We are astounded at how one man, in one lifetime, can screw so many, so well.
CHATUR=>With rigorous training, he’s built up his stamina. He’s spent every living minute just screwing. Let’s replicate his methods.
CROWD=>I-C-E … I-C-E … I-C-E
CHATUR=>Tomorrow ICE students will go across the globe. Wherever we go, we promise to screw.
CHATUR=>We will make ICE proud.
CHATUR=>We’ll hoist this screwer’s ﬂ ag all over the world. We’ll show the world that our capacity to screw... cannot be matched by any student... anywhere on the planet.
CHATUR=>No other student, no other student!
CHATUR=>Mr. Minister. Good evening.
CHATUR=>You have given this institution what it sorely needs.
RANCHO=>Booty, funds.
CHATUR=>Bosom!
DUBEY=>It’s bosom, stupid. Bosom means ...
MINISTER=>What nonsense! That’s insulting.
CHATUR=>Everyone has a bosom, but it remains pocketed. No one offers it so readily!
MINISTER=>Vulgar fellow!
CHATUR=>You have generously offered your bosom ... to this relentless screwer.
DIRECTOR=>It’s miscommunication. fefuLVj cÙkeht+ dgha ds!
CHATUR=>Now see how he makes it grow.
MINISTER=>Is this what you teach here, Director?
MINISTER=>Had you invited me here to insult me?
MINISTER=>Impertinent fool!
CHATUR=>On this august occasion, here’s a Sanskrit verse ....
RANCHO=>Listen to this – the might of his farting in verse.
CHATUR=>A good loud fart is honourable.
DIRECTOR=>Out!
MILLIMETER=>‘Fart’? Go, Silencer!
CHATUR=>A medium fart is tolerable.
RANCHO=>Tolerable tolerable!
CHATUR=>Softer windbreaks are terrible.
CHATUR=>What did I do?
FARHAN=>That’s what mindless cramming does to you.
RANCHO=>Cramming may see you through four years of college but it will ‘screw’ you for the next 40 years!
RANCHO=>He still doesn’t get it
FARHAN=>‘Medium fart is tolerable’... Unbelievable! You’re a poet, Rancho. How did you think of this?
RANCHO=>That was fun. He didn’t know what hit him.
CHATUR=>You swines. What did I ever do to you?
RANCHO=>Hey!
RANCHO=>Oye!
RANCHO=>Sorry man. Don’t take it personally.
CHATUR=>I will. Chatur Ramalingam will never forget this insult. I’ll think of it every minute, every second of my life.
RANCHO=>Sorry man. That was a demo for Raju – don’t cram blindly. Understand and enjoy the wonders of Science.
CHATUR=>I’m not here to enjoy.
FARHAN=>So you’re here to screw science.
CHATUR=>Laugh at my methods. But one day these methods will bring me success. That day I’ll laugh and you’ll cry.
RANCHO=>You’re on the wrong track again. Don’t
CHATUR=>These ideals don’t work in the real world. You take your train, I’ll take mine. Ten years from now, we’ll meet at the same station. Same day. Same place. We’ll see who’s more successful you... or I. Have the balls? C’mon, bet! It’s a challenge. Watch it!
RANCHO=>What are you doing?
RANCHO=>Watch it!
FARHAN=>What has happened to him?
RANCHO=>What’s he writing?
PIA=>I’m not used to such expensive gifts, Suhas.
CHATUR=>Don’t forget this date.
PIA=>I’ll be back.
PIA=>You changed the speech?
RANCHO=>What?
PIA=>Don’t lie.
RANCHO=>Oh ... Yeah.
PIA=>What’s your problem with Dad?
RANCHO=>I have no problem I’m making an inverter named after him.
RANCHO=>Look ... Oh!
MILLIMETER=>She destroyed it!
PIA=>Why’re you harassing Dad?
RANCHO=>‘Cause he runs a factory, not a college. Churning out asses. Like that one!
RANCHO=>She destroyed it, man.
PIA=>How dare you call him an ass?
RANCHO=>He is one! First engineering, then MBA, then becomes a banker in USA. Because it rakes in more money? Life for him is just a proﬁ t-loss statement.
RANCHO=>He sees proﬁ t in you, so he’s with you. Director’s daughter, doctor in the making ... Good for his image! It’s not you he cares for.
PIA=>Who do you think you are? What do you mean he doesn’t care for me?
RANCHO=>New watch? One moment.
MILLIMETER=>Yes.
RANCHO=>Do you always need a demo?
RANCHO=>Hey, Suhas!
SUHAS=>What? Lost the watch! jSUpks vjs dksbZ ugha ;kjA u;h ys ysukA
SUHAS=>Just shut up! How could you be so careless, Pia?! And this callous attitude – It’s disgusting! It’s disrespectful!
SUHAS=>Where were you?
RANCHO=>She’s looking for her watch.
RANCHO=>Never mind. Get another.
SUHAS=>It cost 400,000!
RANCHO=>Mine’s just 250/ but keeps the same time.
SUHAS=>That was a limited-edition watch. Now wear your ancient piece of junk at dinner.
SUHAS=>What are you staring at?
SUHAS=>Here come the tears! Real mature, Pia. I can’t handle this! Stop crying and look for it.
PIA=>Find another wrist for this watch ... Ass!
PIA=>Get lost!
PIA=>What do you mean? jSUpks eryc ;s fd tc oks rqEgkjs lkeus vkrk gS rqEgs dHkh ,slk yxk dh gok;sa pyus yxh] Lyks
RANCHO=>You are solid! You called him an ass to his face!
RANCHO=>It’s too noisy here. She’s saying “Thank you”, I hear “Get lost”.
PIA=>I said “Get lost”.
RANCHO=>Don’t get so uptight. Actually, you never really loved him.
RANCHO=>When you see him, do the winds whisper a melody? Does your scarf ﬂ y
PIA=>That happens in ﬁ lms, not in real life.
RANCHO=>Happens in life too – if you love a person ... not an ass.
RANCHO=>Hello. What?
RANCHO=>Oh God! Ok, I’m on my way.
RANCHO=>You’re a Medical student right?
RANCHO=>Need your help. It’s an emergency, please.

RANCHO=>Please come with me. What’s that oath you doctors take – you’ll never deny a patient help ... the Hippocratic Oath. Please help me, it’s an emergency.
PIA=>You gate-crash my sister’s wedding, break off my engagement, my dad is popping BP pills because of you and here I am, helping you! Unbelievable! This Hippocratic Oath, It’s really done us in!
RANCHO=>Where’s Raju, Aunty?
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Gone to get a cab. Called the ambulance two hours ago. In this country, pizza reaches in 30 minutes but an ambulance!
PIA=>He needs hospitalisation. Urgently
RAJU’S MOTHER=>Oh God.

RANCHO=>Doctor, Doctor, emergency, emergency!
RANCHO=>Patient!
E X T.=>CONTINUOUS
RANCHO=>Move, it’s an emergency! Move! Move! Move! Move! It’s an emergency!
RANCHO=>That’s the patient. Keep this. Hey, here’s Raju …
RAJU=>What the hell! You brought Dad on the scooter.
RANCHO=>Should I’ve sent him by courier?
RAJU=>No wisecracks on Dad’s profession! Where is he?
RANCHO=>Go ask the doctor.
PIA=>OK.
DOCTOR=>Bye.
DOCTOR=>Close call, Pia. A little delay and we would have lost him.
DOCTOR=>Glad you didn’t wait for an ambulance and got him on the scooter. Call me if there’s a problem.
RAJU=>Rancho. Thank you.
FARHAN=>Thanking your buddies! Silencer teaching you manners?
RANCHO=>Didn’t he teach you – a friend is a man’s greatest bosom?
PIA=>Go on now. You have an exam tomorrow.
RANCHO=>Exams we have many but Dad mostly just one. We won’t budge from here without your father. Don’t worry.
RAJU=>Rancho, forgive me. I was scared
RANCHO=>It’s ok. Quiet, now.
RAJU=>Please forgive me.
RANCHO=>It’s ok, calm down. Go see your dad.
RANCHO=>And don’t go with that weepy face.
RAJU=>Thanks buddy.
RANCHO=>Go.
RANCHO=>Natty scooter. Saved a life. How much does it cost?
PIA=>Pour some mint chutney on it. It’ll tell you.
RANCHO=>Oh...
RANCHO=>Hey, Happy Independence Day, buddy!
PIA=>But today isn’t Independence Day.
RANCHO=>For you it is! Now you’re free to wear your mom’s watch.
RANCHO=>No ass can say it’s an ancient piece of junk. Bye.
PIA=>Hey! How do you know it was my mom’s watch?
RANCHO=>At your sister’s wedding, you wore sparkling new clothes. Only the watch was old. What could that mean?
RANCHO=>You really missed your mom that day, didn’t you?
PIA=>Yes.
RANCHO=>Your mom must’ve been really beautiful?
PIA=>Yes. How do you know?
RANCHO=>Seen your dad? “Life is a race. If you don’t run fast you’ll be a broken egg ... the cuckoo bird”.
PIA=>You!
PIA=>Hello. Wake up ...
RANCHO=>Huh ... Uncle’s dead?
RAJU=>What?
PIA=>No, stupid! It’s 8.30, your exam is at 9.
FARHAN=>But we can’t leave him alone.
PIA=>I’m here. It’s a matter of three hours. Take my scooter. It’s getting late.
RANCHO=>Hey ... Gosh, what an ancient watch!
PIA=>Go!
EXAMINER=>Settle down there!
RAJU=>Sorry, we’re late.
RANCHO=>It was an emergency!

RANCHO=>Please, ﬁ ve minutes. We started half an hour late. It was an emergency.
FARHAN=>He glared at us like we’d asked for both his kidneys.
FARHAN=>But we continued writing. He got busy in arranging the answer sheets.
RANCHO=>Done, Sir.
EXAMINER=>You’re late. I can’t accept these.
FARHAN=>Sir, please, Sir!
RANCHO=>Sir, do you know who we are?
EXAMINER=>Prime Minister’s son? Even then ... I will not accept your paper.
RANCHO=>Do you know our names and roll numbers?
EXAMINER=>No ... Who are you?
RANCHO=>He doesn’t know – Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
EXAMINER=>Hey, what’s your roll number?
EXAMINER=>Where the hell are their papers?
EXAMINER=>Aah!
RAJU=>O Lord, have mercy.
FARHAN=>Today was Results day. Everyone was striking a deal with god …
RAJU=>Just take the case of my Electronics. I’ll offer a coconut.
FARHAN=>100/ won’t bribe even a trafﬁ c cop let alone the Almighty.
FARHAN=>Check from the bottom. Check from the bottom.
RAJU=>Second last.
RAJU=>You are ... last!
FARHAN=>And you?
FARHAN=>Rancho?
RAJU=>Not there!
FARHAN=>What?
FARHAN=>My heart sank. Not ’cause our ranks tanked, but ’cause our friend ﬂ unked.
CHATUR=>There’s a mistake. It’s not possible. It’s injustice!
FARHAN=>What’s Silencer howling about?
RAJU=>He got the second rank.
FARHAN=>Who’s ﬁ rst?
RAJU=>Rancho.
FARHAN=>Rancho?
FARHAN=>What?
FARHAN=>Move over!
GOVIND=>Ranchhoddas Chanchad. Front row. Right of the Director.
FARHAN=>We learned a lesson in Human Behavior: Your friend fails, you feel bad. Your friend tops, you feel worse. We were sad. Two others were sadder.
GOVIND=>Uday Sinha. Second row. Third the seat. Alok Mital Second row ﬁ fth Seat.
RANCHO=>Sir, why this seating according to rank?
DIRECTOR=>Any problem with that?
RANCHO=>Yes, this grading system is like a caste system: A-graders: Masters C-graders: Slaves. It’s not nice, Sir.
DIRECTOR=>You have a better idea?
RANCHO=>Yes. Results should not be displayed at all. Why publicise someone’s ﬂ aws? If your iron count is low, will the doctor prescribe tonic or air your report on TV. You see, Sir?
RANCHO=>Bet, Sir bet?
DIRECTOR=>So basically, what you are saying is, I should personally go to each student’s room and whisper in the ears ... “You have come ﬁ rst”; “You’re second”; “Oh, I’m so sorry, you have failed”.
RANCHO=>No Sir, I mean grades create a divide. I’ve topped, so I’m next to you. My pals came last, they’re in the back in the corner.
DIRECTOR=>At least they’re in the corner. More time with you, and they’ll be out of the photo. They will neither pass, nor get a job.
RANCHO=>They’ll get jobs, Sir. There must be some ﬁ rm that prefers humans to machines. They’ll get jobs. I guarantee.
DIRECTOR=>You guarantee it! You guarantee it!
DIRECTOR=>Even if one of them gets a job in campus interviews ...
GOVIND=>Yes?
DIRECTOR=>… shave off my moustache.
DIRECTOR=>Govind!
GOVIND=>Yes, Sir?
PHOTOGRAPHER=>Smile, please. jSUpks gSIih] lj!

CHATUR=>Where’s this?
CHANAWALA=>If I could read, would I sell chick peas?
CHATUR=>He can’t read.
RAJU=>But he can speak.
RAJU=>Wait. Do you know a Ranchhoddas Chanchad?
CHANAWALA=>Yes, he lives there.
FARHAN=>Let’s go!
RAJU=>Chatur, your pills.
CHATUR=>Thanks. Where were they?
RAJU=>In the pocket.
CHATUR=>Hey how dare you! That’s my pant!
RAJU=>Karl Marx says to share all resources.
CHATUR=>Hey Shut up. Take off the pants.
RAJU=>Hey you will give people the wrong idea.
CHATUR=>I want it now!
FARHAN=>Rancho’s father.
RAJU=>What happened?
REAL RANCHO=>Yes?
FARHAN=>Brother, where can Ranchhoddas be found?
ATTENDANT=>There he is sitting.
FARHAN=>Thank you.
FARHAN=>Rancho ...
FARHAN=>Sorry. We’re looking for Ranchhoddas.
REAL RANCHO=>I am Ranchhoddas.
FARHAN=>No, I mean ... ‘Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad’.
REAL RANCHO=>Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad. That’s me.
POLITICIAN=>Ranchhod, take care, Son.
FARHAN=>‘Ranchhoddas Chanchad’.
FARHAN=>Raju!
RAJU=>I’ll be in the Guinness book for driving from Delhi to Shimla in an underwear. That too, for the wrong guy!
FARHAN=>Same name, same degree, same photo, but a different guy. What’s going on?
RAJU=>How did Silencer get Rancho’s address?
FARHAN=>Good point! Hey Chatur, come here.
CHATUR=>Hey! Hey!
CHATUR=>How dare you open this? I got this from San Francisco, handmade biscuits.
CHATUR=>Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu. jktw Qqulq[k ckaxnw\ vcs ;s dkSu gS\
RAJU=>Phunsukh Bangdu? Now, who’s that?
CHATUR=>Not Bangdu. Wangdu. ‘W’. Phunsukh Wangdu. Do you know who that is? He’s a great scientist. 400 patents. The world wants him. Took me a year to get
RAJU=>Forget Wangdu. How’d you get Rancho’s address?
CHATUR=>You should be thanking Phunsukh Wangdu. He led me to Rancho.
CHATUR=>See this.
CHATUR=>My secretary was here to ﬁ x an appointment with Wangdu.
CHATUR=>She didn’t get the appointment with Wangdu but I found Rancho. I checked the Shimla directory and found Rancho’s name.
RAJU=>What happened to his face? Plastic surgery in honour of your visit?
FARHAN=>Only one man has can give the answer.
REAL RANCHO=>Sorry Papa, I couldn’t fulﬁ ll your last wish. You kept asking me to take you on a pilgrimage. But I waited for the highway tender.
REAL RANCHO=>There the tender opened, here you closed your eyes. I am so sorry, Papa. I could not be a good son...
FARHAN=>What are you saying …
FARHAN=>You’re an engineer. Your degree’s on the wall! You were a very good son.
REAL RANCHO=>How dare you barge in without permission? I’ll have you arrested.
FARHAN=>No, you’ll be arrested. We’ve made enquiries. You use the degree to clinch contracts.
RAJU=>It’s our friend’s degree. How did you get it?
REAL RANCHO=>This is a 150-acre estate. If I shoot and bury you, no one would even notice. Get the point? Now get lost.
REAL RANCHO=>I’m taking Papa’s ashes to the sacred river. Can take yours too.
FARHAN=>Grab Papa! Here, here.
REAL RANCHO=>No!
FARHAN=>Here, here!
REAL RANCHO=>Let go of Papa!
RAJU=>Tell the truth or Papa is ﬂ ushed!
REAL RANCHO=>Hand over Papa!
RAJU=>Papa goes to the sacred sewer.
REAL RANCHO=>Get Papa out of the pot.
RAJU=>You pull the trigger, I pull the ﬂ ush.
REAL RANCHO=>I’ll count to three.
FARHAN=>Whom are you scaring? Fire.
FARHAN=>Raju, scatter the ashes.
REAL RANCHO=>One.
FARHAN=>Take us down, and Papa’s going down the drain.
FARHAN=>What?
REAL RANCHO=>Two.
FARHAN=>Then grope for him in the gutter.
FARHAN=>What is it, Raju?
RAJU=>We’ve got the wrong urn. It’s empty!
FARHAN=>Empty?
REAL RANCHO=>Empty?
FARHAN=>Empty – we’ll empty it out!
REAL RANCHO=>No, no!
FARHAN=>We’ll empty it out
REAL RANCHO=>No! Hands up!
RAJU=>Who are you?
REAL RANCHO=>I am Ranchhoddas.
REAL RANCHO=>I swear on Papa, it’s true. I am Ranchhodas! That was Chhote.
REAL RANCHO=>He was our gardener’s son. Everyone called him Chhote. He stayed on with us after he was orphaned. He did odd jobs around the house, ran errands. He had a passion for learning.
REAL RANCHO=>He’d wear my old uniform and slip into school. And attend any class he liked.
REAL RANCHO=>I took advantage of him. I made him do my homework, take my exams. It was going well, till one day ...
REAL RANCHO=>Our teacher saw a sixth grader doing tenth grade math.
TEACHER=>Which grade are you in, son? What’s your name?
REAL RANCHO=>We got caught. Papa was a powerful man, so our teacher alerted him before going to the Principal.
SHAMALDAS=>You started it, you will ﬁ nish it.
SHAMALDAS=>People pretend to show me respect, but behind my back they mock me as an illiterate. I won’t let that happen to my son. This boy wants to study. I want just a degree. Let the game go on. Make this kid an engineer and I’ll have a degree in my son’s name on that wall.
REAL RANCHO=>I went to London for four years, he went to college as me. He’d promised to cut contact with all after getting the degree.
REAL RANCHO=>But he always said, “I will not meet but then what will you people do? Two idiots will come looking for me.”
REAL RANCHO=>He really misses you both. I’ll give you his address, go to him. But please keep my secret.
REAL RANCHO=>Papa!
ATTENDANT=>You got the wrong urn, Sir. Papa is in here.
CHATUR=>What the hell’s going on? Who was that gun guy?
RAJU=>Complicated story. Without subtitles. You will not understand.
FARHAN=>Ignore it.
FARHAN=>Ladakh.
CHATUR=>Where are we going?
FARHAN=>To meet Rancho.
CHATUR=>What’s he doing in Ladakh?
FARHAN=>No clue. We have the address of a school.
CHATUR=>I’m Vice President of Rockledge Corporation, and he ... A for Apple, B for Ball ...
CHATUR=>Next week I will sign a huge deal with Phunsukh Wangdu and he …
CHATUR=>Ladakh! Why? Qjgku jSUpks ls feyusA
CHATUR=>School teacher?
RAJU=>D for Donkey man!
CHATUR=>And he ... A for Apple, B for Ball ...
FARHAN=>Today my respect for that idiot shot up. Most of us went to college just for a degree. No degree meant no plum job, no pretty wife ... no credit card, no social status. None of this mattered to him. He was in college for the joy of learning. He never cared if he was ﬁ rst or last.
DIRECTOR=>Who was the ﬁ rst man on the Moon?
DIRECTOR=>Soon, 26 companies will be here with job offers. You’ll have a job even before your ﬁ nal exam.
DIRECTOR=>Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong. We all know it. Who was the second?
DIRECTOR=>Don’t waste your time, it’s not important. Nobody remembers the man who comes second.
DIRECTOR=>This is your last lap, my friends Put the medal on the pedal. Accelerator dabao. Go out there and make history!
DIRECTOR=>Any questions?
DIRECTOR=>Yes?
RAJU=>Sir, suppose a student gets a job. But narrowly fails the ﬁ nal exam, will he still have the job?
DIRECTOR=>Very good question. Anyone else with the same question?
DIRECTOR=>As expected. A beat.
DIRECTOR=>Please come on stage. Everybody give them a big hand. Come on stage. Come!
DIRECTOR=>Come, come, don’t waste my time!
DIRECTOR=>For the last four years they’ve been our most consistent students. Consistently last in every exam.
DIRECTOR=>Come my geniuses, come. Their brains will fetch a handsome price. ’Cause they’re completely unused.
DIRECTOR=>And to answer their question, the exam won’t affect their jobs because no company will hire them anyway! They’re so unique, their names will be written in gold – ‘Farhanitrate’ and ‘Prerajulisation’.
DIRECTOR=>Give them a big hand, please everybody.
FARHAN=>He screwed us! In front of everyone.
RAJU=>God, I’ll give up meat, light a 1000 incense sticks. Do me just one favor – pick Virus from this world!

FARHAN=>You shut up. You’re in the centre of the photo every year. We’re rotting in the

RANCHO=>Quit engineering, marry photography, follow your talent.
RANCHO=>If Lata Mangeshkar’s dad forced her to be a fast bowler and Sachin Tendulkar’s dad pushed him to be a singer, imagine the disaster?
RANCHO=>Do you get it? Idiot! Loves Photography, but is marrying machines.
RAJU=>Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas engineering is my girlfriend and wife both. But I still fail. Why?
FARHAN=>Explain.
RANCHO=>’Cause you’re a coward. Scared of the future. Look at this, more holy rings than ﬁ ngers. One ring per fear: exam, sister’s dowry and job. With such fear of tomorrow, how will you live today? How will you focus on studies?
RANCHO=>Strange buddies! One lives in fear and the other in pretense.
FARHAN=>You live in both – fear and pretense.
RANCHO=>Hey! I am not scared!
FARHAN=>Listen, he loves Pia but is scared to tell her ...
RAJU=>Easy to offer free advice, tough to follow it. Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.
RAJU=>Yes!
RANCHO=>What rubbish!
RANCHO=>Hey!
RAJU=>Say!
RANCHO=>There’s no connection!
RAJU=>Deep connection, Your Holiness.
FARHAN=>Listen, if you confess to Pia. I’ll tell
RAJU=>Yes!
FARHAN=>Yes!
RAJU=>And I’ll dump my rings before the job interview. Deal?
FARHAN=>Have the guts?
RAJU=>His Holiness is speechless.
RANCHO=>Let’s go.
RANCHO=>Follow me.
FARHAN=>Where?
RAJU=>Where?
RANCHO=>Let’s go.
RAJU=>Where?
FARHAN=>Hey Virus! I’m anti-Virus.
RAJU=>Hope no dog here.
RANCHO=>Cowards! Let’s go.
FARHAN=>If there is any danger, I’ll give the Virus alert.
RAJU=>Shh, sshh!
FARHAN=>Beware – Virus inside.
RAJU=>Hoi …
RANCHO=>Shh!
RAJU=>Need background score?
RANCHO=>Pia!
MONA=>Who’s it?
RANCHO=>Don’t yell! It’s me, Ranchhoddas Chanchad. Just listen for a moment, then I’m gone Say not a word ...
RAJU=>Say not a word …
RANCHO=>Pia … Those 22 minutes with you on the scooter were the most enchanting 22 minutes of my life.
RANCHO=>I could spend an eternity with you on the scooter.
MONA=>Wow!
RANCHO=>Every night you ride into my dreams on your scooter, dressed as a bride.
RANCHO=>Instead of a veil, you lift your helmet
RANCHO=>… and come close to kiss me.
RANCHO=>But that kiss doesn’t happen.
MONA=>Why?
RANCHO=>Because the noses collide, and I wake up.
MONA=>The noses never collide, stupid!
RANCHO=>I’m sorry, I thought you were Pia.
MONA=>I wish I was.
PIA=>Sister, why did you interrupt? It took him four years to say this.
MONA=>Pia, kiss him. Show that noses don’t collide. You have my permission, kiss him... He’s so cute!
RANCHO=>Who’s this?
PIA=>My sister!
MONA=>Who are you?
MONA=>When you were talking, he kicked. First time!
RANCHO=>He? How do you know the baby is a ‘he’ or ‘she’?
MONA=>Papa asked the astrologer if we’d get an engineer or a doctor.
RANCHO=>Meaning?
PIA=>Boy becomes an engineer, girl a doctor.
RANCHO=>Champ, better stay inside. Out here it’s a circus. Your grandpa is the ringmaster. He’ll crack his whip – “Run! Life is a race. Be an engineer”. But you follow your heart. If Grandpa scares you then put your hand on your heart and say, “Aal izz well”.
MONA=>Ha! He kicked! Say it again “Aal izz well”.
MONA=>Kicked again. Once more – “Aal izz well”.

RANCHO=>Without any dowry! The bridegroom wants nothing at all.

RANCHO=>You know who the bridegroom is?
RANCHO=>Yes! You know who the bridegroom is?
FARHAN=>Yeah!
FARHAN=>Guess!
FARHAN=>Yes.
RANCHO=>He loves animals.
FARHAN=>Huh ... ?
RANCHO=>You know him very well!
RANCHO=>He’s going to be a wildlife photographer.
FARHAN=>Quiet ... Shhhh ...
RANCHO=>Didn’t get it?
RANCHO=>It’s our Farhan. Farhan will never take any dowry. Farhan will marry your sister.
RANCHO=>For Free! Free! Free!
RANCHO=>Hey, hey, hey! Raju, hey!
FARHAN=>Raju!
FARHAN=>One kilo lady’s ﬁ nger, 500 grams cottage cheese for ‘free’ would’ve woken him. Why sacriﬁ ce me?
RANCHO=>Well done, buddy. So it’s all ﬁ xed. Farhan will marry your sister.

FARHAN=>Thank you. Why?
RAJU=>I’m going for the job interview.
RAJU=>No. I’m going for the interview. You’re going home.
FARHAN=>Why would I go home?
RAJU=>Remember, we promised this rascal.
FARHAN=>You coming with me?
RAJU=>Give me your tie.
FARHAN=>Why?
FARHAN=>What’s that?
PIA=>I doubt you’ll go for the interview after reading this.
PIA=>A letter.
RANCHO=>For you, from Hungary.
PIA=>Some photographer called André Istvan.
FARHAN=>You posted my letter!
RANCHO=>He loved your pictures. The guy wants you to assist him.
PIA=>Internship in the Brazilian rain forest, for a year.
RANCHO=>Will pay you, too.
FARHAN=>Dad will never agree.
RANCHO=>Go speak to him ... from your heart.
RANCHO=>For once, dump your fears or someday, on your deathbed, you’ll regret it. You’ll remember that the letter was in your hand, the taxi at the gate with just a little courage, you could’ve turned your life around.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Do you think he’ll like it?
MOTHER=>Why such an expensive gift?
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Our son’s getting his ﬁ rst job today. Don’t be stingy at such a proud moment.
FARHAN’S MOTHER=>Farhan?
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Didn’t you have the job interview today?
FARHAN=>I didn’t go. I don’t want to be an engineer, Dad.
RAJU=>See that building? I jumped from its third ﬂ oor.
RAJU=>Because I was rusticated from college.
RAJU=>Drunk, I urinated on the Director’s door.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>That scoundrel Rancho is messing with your mind!
FARHAN=>I don’t enjoy engineering. I’d make a terrible engineer. Rancho has a simple belief: Make your passion your profession. Then work will become play.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>What will you earn in that jungle?
FARHAN=>A small stipend, but I’ll learn a lot.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Five years from now when you see your friends buying cars and homes, you’ll curse yourself.
FARHAN=>Life as an engineer will bring only frustration. Then I’ll curse you I’d rather curse myself, Dad.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>The world will laugh! Label you a loser, for quitting in the ﬁ nal year. Mr. Kapoor feels you’re fortunate to be at ICE. What’ll he think?
FARHAN=>Mr. Kapoor didn’t provide me with an air-conditioner. It wasn’t Mr. Kapoor who slept in discomfort while I slept well. He didn’t take me around the zoo on his shoulders.
FARHAN=>You did all that Father.
FARHAN=>Dad, how you feel, matters to me. Mr. Kapoor makes no difference. I don’t even know his ﬁ rst name.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>You think you’re the hero of a melodrama?
FARHAN’S MOTHER=>Enough, please. He’s upset. God forbid, if he did something crazy like Raju.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Then the discussion is over. Don’t say a word or his Lordship will jump off the roof.
FARHAN=>No, Dad. I’ll never attempt suicide. I promise.
FARHAN=>The Rancho you detest put this picture in my wallet. Told me to see it if a suicidal thought crossed my mind and imagine what’d happen to your smiles when you see my dead body.
FARHAN=>I want to convince you, Dad but not with a suicide threat.
FARHAN=>Dad, what will happen if I become a photographer? I’ll earn less I’ll have a smaller house, a smaller car But I’ll be happy. I will be really happy Whatever I do for you will be out of genuine love.
FARHAN=>I’ve always listened to you For once, let me listen to my heart. Please, Dad.
FARHAN=>Dad .... Please don’t go away.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Return this.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Son, what’s the cost of a professional camera? Can the laptop be exchanged for it?
FARHAN’S FATHER=>If you need more money, just ask.
FARHAN’S FATHER=>Go live your life, my son.
RAJU=>Fear. I was a good student since childhood. Parents hoped I’d end their poverty. That scared me.
RAJU=>Here I saw the mad race. You don’t count if you’re not ﬁ rst My fear grew. Fear is not good for grades, Sir. Prayed to God for favours. No ... begged for favours.
RAJU=>16 broken bones gave me two months to think and reﬂ ect. Finally, sense dawned.
RAJU=>Today, I didn’t beg God for this job, just thanked him for this life. If you reject me, no regrets I’ll still do something worthwhile with my life.
COMPANY HEAD=>Such frank behaviour is not good for our ﬁ rm. We need someone diplomatic to handle clients. You’re too straightforward.
COMPANY HEAD=>But if you assure us you’ll control this attitude …
COMPANY HEAD=>... We may consider you.
RAJU=>It took two broken legs to get me up on my feet. Wasn’t easy to get this attitude. Can’t change it, Sir.
RAJU=>You keep your job... I’ll keep my attitude. I’m sorry, don’t mind, Sir.
COMPANY HEAD=>Wait.
COMPANY HEAD=>I’ve interviewed countless candidates for 25 years. Everyone turns into a yes-man to get the job. Where did you spring from, Son?
RAJU=>Sir?
COMPANY HEAD=>Shall we discuss the salary?
RAJU=>Thank you, Sir! Thank you!
DIRECTOR=>Govind!
GOVIND=>You had said, ‘If one of them gets a job, shave it off.’
PIA=>What have you done?
DIRECTOR=>I feel naked without my moustache. I’ve lost my dignity.
DIRECTOR=>I won’t accept defeat, Rastogi. The job isn’t yours until you pass your ﬁ nal exam. And this time, I will set the question paper.
DIRECTOR=>Everything is fair in love and war. And this is World War III. Rastogi, you’re dead meat!
PIA=>Dad, that’s not fair.
RANCHO=>What are you doing here?
RANCHO=>Be careful.
RANCHO=>You’ve been drinking.
PIA=>Yup, had to down a couple.
RANCHO=>A couple too many!
PIA=>Needed the guts.
RANCHO=>For what?
PIA=>For stealing this.
RANCHO=>What’s this?
PIA=>The duplicate key to Virus’s ofﬁ ce.
PIA=>Everything’s fair in love and war.
RANCHO=>Shh, shh, shh
PIA=>The question paper’s in a cover with a red seal. Dad has set it, to fail Raju. Go get it!
RANCHO=>Are you mad or what! That’s cheating!
PIA=>Tell me something, Do you really feel the noses collide while kissing?
RANCHO=>Wait. Have some dhokla.
PIA=>You Gujaratis are so cute. But why does your food sound so dangerous? Dhokla, fafda, handwa, thepla, khakhra.
PIA=>Sound like missiles – ‘Today Bush dropped two dhoklas on Iraq …’
PIA=>‘400 dead, 200 injured’!
RANCHO=>C’mon.
RANCHO=>C’mon. Oh ...
PIA=>I can deal with khakhra, fafda. But your name ... ‘Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad’ – yuck, I won’t change my last name after marriage.
RANCHO=>Pia, we can’t get married.
PIA=>Why? Is there someone else?
PIA=>Are you gay?
RANCHO=>No ...
PIA=>Then why don’t you propose to me?
PIA=>Are you impotent?
PIA=>Then prove it. Prove it. jSUpks fi;k!
PIA=>Prove it.
RANCHO=>Pia!
RANCHO=>Pia, no!
FARHAN=>Stop, stop!

FARHAN=>We didn’t inform Pia.
CHATUR=>Stop here, my bladders are bursting. Qjgku 'kVvi~ ;kjA
FARHAN=>Shut up!
RAJU=>Are you in touch with her?
FARHAN=>No but I have her home number.
RAJU=>Then call her, I’ll stop.
FARHAN=>Stop, Stop, Stop.
CHATUR=>No place for urine-expulsion in this country.
FARHAN=>Hello, is Pia there?
MAID=>No, she’s not.
FARHAN=>Is she at the hospital?
FARHAN=>Too late! She’s married?
MAID=>Why would she be there? She’s getting married today in Manali.
RAJU=>Not yet. It’s a six-hour drive If we rush, we’ll reach before the vows. What do you say?
FARHAN=>It’s a no-brainer. Let’s turn back.
CHATUR=>No turning back. Straight to Ladakh. We’ll meet Rancho and return. I have a Friday meeting with Phunsukh Wangdu. Get into the car. If I miss my meeting, the Japanese will get him. They’re offering him a ﬁ rst name in the company ‘Phunsukh and Fujiyashi’, proﬁ t sharing, stock options, full creative control .....
CHATUR=>Raju … Raju.
FARHAN=>‘Pia weds Suhas’!
RAJU=>Ok.
RAJU=>Thanks for the suit.

RAJU=>Off, now.
RAJU=>Housekeeping, Sir.
SUHAS=>Come in.
SUHAS=>Amore Amore ... Amore ... Quick quick... Quick, iron my sherwani.
PIA=>You’re mad, Farhan!
FARHAN=>We found Rancho! Now you can’t marry this ass.
SUHAS=>Amore ... Amore ... Amore ...
FARHAN=>Don’t fool yourself, Pia. You still love Rancho. You’re still eating his favourite food.
FARHAN=>He’s incorrigible. Once a price tag, always a price tag.
PIA=>Shut up, Farhan. Suhas is a changed man. He doesn’t speak of brands and prices anymore.
SUHAS=>My Rs 150,000 sherwani ...
SUHAS=>Why do you people eat chutney?
RAJU=>I’ll sort it out, Sir.
SUHAS=>How?
RAJU=>Our laundry specialises in cleaning mint- stained suits. I’ll clean it in a jiffy.
RAJU=>One minute, Sir!
SUHAS=>Get it soon!
PIA=>But it’s too late now, Farhan.
MONA=>Pia!
MONA=>Let’s go, Pia, we’re late.
RAJU=>Pia, it’s me ... Raju. Don’t yell, they’ll kill me.
PIA=>Where is Suhas?
SUHAS=>Housekeeping took my sherwani.
PIA=>Go ... Send Suhas here.
RAJU=>It’s rude to leave the ceremony.
FARHAN=>The car’s ready. Grab her hand and run.
FARHAN=>Don’t move.
RAJU=>Yeah, Farhan?
WAITER=>Sir …!
SUHAS=>My sherwani?
WAITER=>You’re here …?
SUHAS=>Yes.
WAITER=>So who’s at the altar?
SUHAS=>Altar?
RAJU=>Another couple of rounds, and we’ll be considered married I’m already married, Pia. Let’s go.
PIA=>It’s too late. People will laugh at me.
RAJU=>So you’ll commit suicide?
DIRECTOR=>Rastogi!
RAJU=>People will gossip brieﬂ y, then forget.
RAJU=>But you ... you’ll regret on your deathbed that the car was at the gate ...
RAJU=>Rancho within reach but in the fear of people, you married this ass.
SUHAS=>Housekeeping?
PIA=>What? jktw ughaa gqbZ gksxh ;kj] ughaa gqbZ gksxhA
FARHAN=>Pia, minor problem.
PIA=>What?
FARHAN=>We don’t know if Rancho’s married.
RAJU=>He won’t be married.
PIA=>And if he is?
RAJU=>Then we’ll drop you back.
RAJU=>Relax! Handmade biscuit? Handmade from San Francisco.
PIA=>What’s he doing here?
FARHAN=>Ignore him ...
RAJU=>The biscuits very good.
FARHAN=>Aal izz well, aal izz well …
FARHAN=>Till yesterday, I was a law-abiding citizen. But in the last 24 hours, I had grounded an aircraft, almost assigned Shamaldas’s ashes to the sewers, and made a bride elope from her own wedding!
FARHAN=>All for Rancho.
FARHAN=>But he too would do anything for friends. Like stealing the question paper... from the lion’s den.
RANCHO=>Envelope with the red seal.
FARHAN=>Ok!
FARHAN=>He feared that if Raju failed, there would be another high jump. We were principled thieves, stealing the paper only for Raju. We’d sworn we won’t even take a peek.
RANCHO=>Where’s it hidden …?
FARHAN=>We’ll grow old searching! Ask Pia.
MONA=>Mr. Papa-To-Be!
DIRECTOR=>Pia, your phone.
MONA=>One minute, Pia! Pia!
PIA=>If you say ‘Aal izz well’, he kicks.
MONA=>He kicked!
DIRECTOR=>Pia, your phone.

FARHAN=>Found it! Rancho!
DIRECTOR=>Hello?

FARHAN=>We’re safe!
RAJU=>Where were you?
RANCHO=>Here!
RAJU=>What’s this?
FARHAN=>A gift.
RANCHO=>Virus set it himself, to fail you.
RAJU=>Strange buddies! First teach you to be upright, then offer a path to shame No way. If I pass, it’ll be on my own steam …
FARHAN=>Hey!
RAJU=>If I don’t, it’s still ok.
FARHAN=>Idiot!
FARHAN=>He’d won us over! I felt like embracing him as family ...

DIRECTOR=>How did he get my ofﬁ ce key?
PIA=>I gave him the key, Dad.
PIA=>I wish I’d given this key to my brother. He would be alive today.
PIA=>You think your son fell off a train and died?
MONA=>Stop it, Pia!
MONA=>Shut up, Pia!
PIA=>You decided he’d be an engineer. Did you ever ask him what he wanted to be?
PIA=>You put such pressure on him ... that he chose death over the entrance exam.
DIRECTOR=>I don’t understand ...
MONA=>Dad, you go to your room.
MONA=>Pia, don’t do this!
PIA=>He wanted to study literature, be a writer.
PIA=>But all he wrote was this suicide note.
MONA=>Put that away, please!
PIA=>No more cover-ups!
PIA=>Just once if you’d only said – “Don’t do engineering if you don’t want to. Just do what your heart is in,” then he would be alive today.
DIRECTOR=>He didn’t commit suicide.
PIA=>You’re right, Dad. It wasn’t suicide ... It was murder.
MONA=>Dad ...
MONA=>Dad!
DIRECTOR=>Mona?
DIRECTOR=>Please help, we are desperate here!
RANCHO=>Go back, Millimeter. Why’re you following us?
MILLIMETER=>Why? Your mom owns the road?

DIRECTOR=>Get it from another hospital.
AMBULANCE GUY=>The entire city’s flooded, Sir. We’re helpless.

PIA=>Rancho, even when there were no hospitals or doctors, babies were delivered.
RANCHO=>Yes.
PIA=>You all will deliver this baby.
RANCHO=>All izz well, all izz well!
DIRECTOR=>How dare you? I’ll kill you?
PIA=>Dad, stay out of this!
PIA=>Farhan, get towels and scissors. Millimeter, get clothes clips and hot water. Rancho, cover Mona.

RANCHO=>No crowning.
PIA=>Mona, please push.
MATRON=>She’s tired, Pia.
PIA=>Wake her! If she won’t push, it’s a big problem.
MATRON=>They need a vacuum cup.
PIA=>Where will they get one?
RANCHO=>What’s a vacuum cup? How is it used?
PIA=>If the mother’s too fatigued to push, a cup is placed on baby’s head. Suction makes the cup stick to the head and the baby is pulled out.
PIA=>I’ll show you.
RANCHO=>Yes Sir, vacuum cleaner!
RANCHO=>I can make this.
DIRECTOR=>How?
RANCHO=>With a vacuum cleaner.
DIRECTOR=>Vacuum cleaner?
PIA=>That pressure’s too high. Rancho.
RANCHO=>I’ll control it.
PIA=>Do you have a vacuum cleaner?
DIRECTOR=>Yes, in my ofﬁ ce.
RANCHO=>Farhan, rush and get it.
RANCHO=>Mona, push Mona! C’mon, push! Mona, C’mon!
FARHAN=>Oh my God!
RAJU=>What happened?

RAJU=>Yes, Pia.
PIA=>Raju, what happened?
RAJU=>The power’s gone.

RANCHO=>Farhan! Qjgku gkaA
RANCHO=>Farhan, you get the vacuum, I’ll get the power.
FARHAN=>Yes.
FARHAN=>Ok!
DIRECTOR=>How?
RANCHO=>Millimeter, get Virus out.

RANCHO=>Not this Virus. My Virus, the inverter. Get that, quick!
MILLIMETER=>Sorry, sorry, got it now.
RANCHO=>Raju!

DIRECTOR=>First day of college, you’d asked me a question ... Why didn’t astronauts use a pencil in space?
DIRECTOR=>If a pencil tip breaks in space it would ﬂ oat in zero gravity. It could get into someone’s eyes or nose or the instrument panel.
RANCHO=>Yes, Sir.
DIRECTOR=>This was an important invention. You understand?

ANNOUNCER=>And now, student of the year ... Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad!
FARHAN=>Sir, one photo, Sir!
FARHAN=>I wanted to capture all these memories and take them home. That day, we hugged, we rejoiced, we cried ... We vowed that we’d meet at least once a year ... Who knew then, we were seeing Rancho for the last time ...
FARHAN=>Untie him.
CHATUR=>I’ll sue you all in an American court.
PIA=>Raju!
RAJU=>Only Rancho can create a school like this.
PIA=>But where is he?
CHATUR=>Go away creatures!
CHATUR=>I’ll smack you?
FARHAN=>Bingo! He cannot be far ...
FARHAN=>Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?
PIA=>He’s not Ranchhoddas!
RAJU=>Rancho ...
FARHAN=>Chhote... Dammit, what’s his name?
MILLIMETER=>Calm down. Come with me.
RAJU=>Where’s he?
FARHAN=>Rancho.
MILLIMETER=>Farhan, he’s read all your books.
MILLMETER=>Raju, he reads your blog everyday. Proudly shares it with the kids.
MILLIMETER=>Remember your helmet, Pia? It was stolen ...
PIA=>Who are you? How do you know us?
MILLMETRE=>Didn’t you recognise me?
PIA=>No.
MILLIMETER=>How would you? Millimeter is now Centimeter.
FARHAN=>Rascal!
RAJU=>Not Centimeter, you’re Kilometer.
FARHAN=>How did you get here?
MILLIMETER=>I got a letter with a train ticket inside It said – “Miss being in school? Catch this train” ... I did.
FARHAN=>That rascal Rancho!
PIA=>Where is that idiot?
RANCHO=>Dorje, you ﬂ y it.
RANCHO=>Every night you ride into my dreams on a scooter, dressed as a bride.
RANCHO=>Instead of a veil, you lift your helmet and come close to kiss me.
RANCHO=>Ouch!
PIA=>Couldn’t you tell me before leaving?
RANCHO=>No. Sorry.
PIA=>Did you marry?
RANCHO=>What? No.
RANCHO=>You?

RAJU=>Rascal!
FARHAN=>Look here.
RAJU=>How we hunted for you! Didn’t have a coin for one phone call?
PIA=>Add a couple from me too.
FARHAN=>One phone call?
RAJU=>One phone call?
FARHAN=>Rascal, scoundrel!
PIA=>Let him go now.
FARHAN=>On your feet, C’mon!
FARHAN=>You idiot.
CHATUR=>Having fun, idiots?
RANCHO=>Hey ... Hi Chatur.
CHATUR=>Ranchhoddas Chanchad. How do you do, Mr. Teacher? Wow, you’re a teacher in a village – A for Apple, B for Ball...
CHATUR=>Our trains left together. But yours travelled in reverse ... from engineer to primary teacher.
CHATUR=>What’s your salary, Chanchad? Rs 5000? For me that’s $100. My son’s pocket money is more than your salary.
RAJU=>Cut the crap.
CHATUR=>Crap is what he gave us. Wanted to change the education system, change the world. Finally what does he change? Kids’ diapers
FARHAN=>You gonna break his jaw or should I?
RANCHO=>Just relax.
RANCHO=>Unbelievable! Qjgku rw ikxy gS D;k!
CHATUR=>Remember I’d said one day you’d cry and I’d laugh?
CHATUR=>Sign here. Accept – You lost, I won!
RANCHO=>‘Declaration of Defeat’? Unbelievable, man!
RAJU=>Chatur!
FARHAN=>Crazy guy.
CHATUR=>Hey, this is Virus’s pen! You pinched it?
RANCHO=>Forget it, man.
CHATUR=>This is for winners, not losers!
CHATUR=>‘A for apple, B for ball ...’
CHATUR=>If your school ever needs help, call my assistant for a donation.
RANCHO=>He hasn’t changed at all!
FARHAN=>Ignore him.
RAJU=>He’s full of crap.
PIA=>The good news is your name isn’t Ranchhoddas Chanchad Imagine, after marriage, I’m Pia Chanchad – Yuck! By the way, what is your real name?
RANCHO=>Phunsukh Wangdu.
PIA=>Pia ‘Wangdu’! jSUpks gk¡A
RAJU=>You mean, you’re a scientist?
FARHAN=>You have 400 patents?
RANCHO=>Yes.
RANCHO=>Yes.
RANCHO=>Yes.
PIA=>I won’t change my name after marriage.
RAJU=>You mean you’re Chatur’s Wangdu?
RANCHO=>Yes.
FARHAN=>It’s you the Japanese are wooing?
PIA=>I don’t like Wangdu!!
RANCHO=>I think so …
FARHAN=>Are you a scientist or a teacher?
RANCHO=>Scientist, but I also teach children.
RAJU=>So you are The Phunsukh Wangdu?

RANCHO=>The one in your hand – Virus’s pen!
CHATUR=>Virus’s pen?
RANCHO=>Yes, Chatur?
RAJU=>A for Apple, B for Ball is...
FARHAN=>... S for ‘Screwed’.
CHATUR=>You got me, Rancho – I mean, Mr. Wangdu. Totally ﬂ oored me. Good one I hope our personal problems won’t affect this deal.
RAJU=>Hey Chatur – take that.
CHATUR=>I was just joking, man. Deep down, I knew you’d do great things.
CHATUR=>No, really, I swear. No no no no, I’m telling you, Rancho – 100, Chatur – 0. You win, I lose. You don’t believe me?
CHATUR=>Your Majesty, thou art great. Accept this humble offering.
PIA=>Free advice, Mr. Wangdu - Run for your life!
RANCHO=>Chalo!
CHATUR=>Hey Rancho. Rancho, I’ll lose my job, man. I have small kids ...
FARHAN=>His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas had correctly stated – “Follow Excellence … Success will chase you, pants down.”
