PROTAGONIST=>We live in a twilight world...
WELL-DRESSED MAN=>Service tunnels to sewers.
PROTAGONIST=>Covering their tracks.
PROTAGONIST=>Just the cheap seats.
PROTAGONIST=>What about free will?
PROTAGONIST=>You’re well informed.
NEIL=>How’s your parachuting?
WOMAN=>Sanjay, make us a drink.
PRIYA=>I’m Priya Singh.
PROTAGONIST=>The Russian oligarch?
PROTAGONIST=>I’m Mr Crosby’s lunch.
PROTAGONIST=>How do I get to Sator?
CROSBY=>A Kat, I believe.
PROTAGONIST=>Goodbye, Sir Michael.
KAT=>Why would he?
PROTAGONIST=>Where’d you go – Mars?
PROTAGONIST=>I might surprise you.
PROTAGONIST=>But the freeports are.
STAFF MEMBER=>The structure of the vaults is based on The Pentagon – each vault a separate structure within the others. Damage to one structure won’t compromise the others.
NEIL=>Jesus. Nuclear?
PROTAGONIST=>You’ve got something?
PROTAGONIST=>And if you get caught?
PROTAGONIST=>HOW DID YOU KNOW WE’D BE HERE!
NEIL=>We have to go.
PROTAGONIST=>Or I’ve lost my edge.
PROTAGONIST=>Well, try to keep up.
KAT=>Does he know?
PROTAGONIST=>Not yet, so sit tight.
PROTAGONIST=>What if I joined you?
PROTAGONIST=>Then let’s take mine.
SATOR=>We’re finished.
SATOR=>Yes, they will.
KAT=>Can I finish?!
PROTAGONIST=>What’s wrong with me?
KAT=>Burn in hell, Andrei –
KAT=>To sell guns?!
PROTAGONIST=>Try not to use this –
KAT=>No, we’re not.
PROTAGONIST=>No balls in my throat?
PROTAGONIST=>How do I contact you?
NEIL=>I don’t follow.
KAT=>Why am I here?
SATOR=>It’s time to go.
PROTAGONIST=>This isn’t plutonium.
PROTAGONIST=>It’s in the glove box!
SATOR=>Where did you leave it?
SATOR=>I believe you...
NEIL=>Priya’s. Ours.
PROTAGONIST=>Which is not plutonium, is it?
NEIL=>I warned you –
NEIL=>What do we do?
NEIL=>How’s the arm?
PROTAGONIST=>We move the second we hear the engines.
PRIYA=>You’re about to.
PROTAGONIST=>Ground zero for an underground nuclear test. Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation at Stalsk-12 on the 14th – the dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocentre. That explosion seals up the algorithm.
KAT=>Where’s Neil?
KAT=>I can dive it.
JUNIOR CREW MEMBER=>Ma’am? We thought you’d gone ashore.
PROTAGONIST=>We need a distraction.
SATOR=>Our time is up.
KAT=>It’s slippery.
NEIL=>Even from afar.
PROTAGONIST=>Mission accomplished.
