JESUS=>The feeling begins. It's a light tingling at first. Right on the top of my head. Very tender. Like a caress. Soft wings carrying me to Paradise. Then the pain starts.
JESUS=>It feels like the bird has grabbed me from behind. Just above the neck. Talons slip underneath the skin and work and claw their way up the back of my neck. Then the real pain begins. Each claw digs into the soft matter behind my brain, and then across the top of my head toward my eyes. Just before they reach my eyes, they dig down...
JESUS=>And I remember. I have to make a cross.
JESUS=>At first I fasted for three months. Then I whipped myself before sleeping. At first it worked, then the headaches returned. I know it's God. Or the devil. Who can tell them apart? They exchange faces; God sometimes becomes all darkness, the devil all light, and they become confused in my mind.
JESUS=>Who is it? Who are you? Why are you following me?
JUDAS=>Are you ready?
JUDAS=>I said are you ready?
JUDAS=>You're a disgrace.
JESUS=>I'm the disgrace? Judas, I see the blood on your knife.
JUDAS=>Come with us. Help us.
JESUS=>Leave me alone.
JUDAS=>No. This time you won't finish.
JUDAS=>Listen. Everything's ready. We're going to save the Zealot. He could be the one we've been waiting for. You can't just pray for the Messiah. You've got to help him. You can't expect God to do everything. He needs our help too.
JESUS=>He'll have to do it without me.
JUDAS=>You might be killing the Messiah. This Zealot today is not like all the others. I feel it. He's different. Don't finish the cross. Come with us. Don't you want to be part of it? You want the Romans to be here forever?
JESUS=>The Messiah has nothing to do with the Romans.
JUDAS=>Yes he does. How else do you expect to be free? If this Zealot is the Messiah and we don't save him, then he'll die and we'll never know. But if we save him, the miracle might happen.
JESUS=>What miracle?
JUDAS=>The sign, the signal. The royal crown of David will shine on his head.
JESUS=>It can't be much of a miracle if we have to help.
JUDAS=>You're not even ashamed.
JESUS=>No.
JUDAS=>Romans can't find carpenters to make crosses. Except for you. You throw yourself into it like a madman. Everybody thinks you're crazy. But not me. I can see through this act of yours. Fainting, hearing voices, having visions. Everyone thinks you're a madman. But I know what your are. You're an enemy. You're worse than the Romans. You're a Jew who's killing Jews. And you're not ashamed. You don't even have any pride.
JESUS=>No, I don't have any pride. I don't go to Synagogue. I disobey the commandments. I work on the Sabbath. Your Messiahs? You find them, I'll crucify them.
JUDAS=>You're lucky you're a Jew.
JESUS=>Why?
JUDAS=>Anyone else would have been dead by now. You think Zealots are murderers? We're pathfinders, we're patriots, and you're in the way.
JESUS=>Then get me out of the way.
JUDAS=>I will. In my time. Not yours. When I'm told.
JESUS=>When did you ever need permission to kill anybody?
JUDAS=>To kill a Roman, never. To kill a Jew, we all have to agree. We have more respect for Jews than you do. The next time I see you, you're dead.
CENTURION=>Leave him alone. You ready? Come on.
ZEALOT=>You're the people of Israel! God is with us! He's judging us now! Fight!
MAN IN CROWD=>How long do we have to wait for the Messiah?
ANOTHER MAN=>Until you die! Because he's not coming.
WOMAN IN CROWD=>He forgot about us! He doesn't want us!
YOUNG MAN=>Listen to the Zealot! God is strength.
MAN=>Give us strength now!
MARY=>Don't touch him. Get away from him.
WOMAN IN CROWD=>You defend him.
MARY=>Yes. He's my son. He doesn't know what he's doing.
MARY=>Alright. Come away now.
ZEALOT=>Listen! Don't be afraid! God is strong. Rome is smoke. God will blow it away. Remember the Maccabees, remember how they threw out the Greeks! We'll throw out the Romans the same way. There's only one God of Hosts and he's our God!
CENTURION=>Finished?
CENTURION=>'This man naked before you now is condemned for sedition, for lifting his hand against Rome. Even as a boy he pulled the Imperial Eagle from walls. He ran to the mountains and rallied the people to Revolution. He promised a Messiah would come from among the people to rise up and destroy Rome...'
CENTURION=>'...murder... betrayal' ...so on... 'looting...' and so on... 'and therefore he is condemned to die. Rome condemns him. All the Gods of Rome condemn him.' And I condemn him. Start.
JESUS=>Speak softer! I can't understand! Softer!
JESUS=>I still can't... stop... Are you trying to make me understand, or do you just want to hurt me? Well, if I don't belong here, with men, where do I belong? Tell me! Or do you just want to punish me?
MARY=>What are you hearing?
JESUS=>They want to know if I'm afraid. Afraid! Of course I'm afraid! Hear that? I am afraid. Is that what you want? Alright.
MARY=>What do they want?
JESUS=>They want me to speak. To go out and speak!
MARY=>Speak about what?
JESUS=>About the Kingdom of Heaven. But I don't care about the Kingdom of Heaven. I like earth. I like to eat, sleep, see a woman without my head being torn in half.
MARY=>But you can have that right now.
JESUS=>No! Because anytime I try to get what everybody else has, the pain starts. And the voices.
MARY=>And so you make crosses!
JESUS=>Yes, I make crosses! To keep him quiet. To make God hate me! To make him find somebody else.
MARY=>You're sure it's God? You're sure it's not the Devil?
JESUS=>I'm not sure. I'm not sure of anything.
MARY=>If it's the devil, the devil can be cast out.
JESUS=>What if it's God? You can't cast out God.
MARY=>But if it's God, why should he hurt you?
JESUS=>Because he loves me. And I don't want him to love me. I want him to hate me! I want to crucify every one of his Messiahs.
MARY=>The more you dare God, the more you make him angry. Maybe that's why he's made you so unhappy here.
JESUS=>Where?
MARY=>Here. With people. Maybe you shouldn't be here.
JESUS=>If I don't belong with people, who do I belong with, God?
MARY=>I don't know. Go and ask him. Go where God is.
GUARD=>Crossmaker! Here's your share.
GUARD=>What's the matter? Don't you want it?
JESUS=>Yes. I want it.
JESUS=>All this time I've been cursing him, trying to make him hate me. All that pain for something so simple, I should have realized. He just wants me to devote my life to him. If that's what it takes to stop the pain, I'm happy. Only one road leads to God. And it comes out in the desert. God's waiting for me in a well in the monastery. He does love me. I'll hide under his wings.
PEASANT GIRL=>Are you going to Magela?
JESUS=>No. To the monastery.
SECOND GIRL=>Then you take the other road.
PEASANT GIRL=>If you really want to.
SECOND GIRL=>Why not stop and have some bread with us?
JESUS=>No, thank you. I can't.
JESUS=>Lord, thank you for everything, for the loneliness, the hunger, the cold. I don't need anything else.
JESUS=>Who's that? Who's following me?
JESUS=>Is that you?
JESUS=>Magdalene! Magdalene!
JESUS=>Thank you Lord for bringing me where I did not want to come.
JESUS=>He must be one of God's angels. He came down to show me the way.
BLACK MERCHANT=>Prince of India, what does your God have to say about all this?
INDIAN NOBLEMAN=>All what?
BLACK MERCHANT=>Here, in front of you.
INDIAN NOBLEMAN=>That everything is a dream.
OLD MAN=>Well, if it's a dream, then don't wake us.
YOUNG MAN=>Don't take all day, old man. There's six more here before me.
MAGDALENE=>Is there anyone else?
MAGDALENE=>What are you doing here.
JESUS=>I want you to forgive me.
JESUS=>I've done too many wrong things. I'm going to the desert. To the monastery. Before I go I want you to forgive me. Please.
MAGDALENE=>Oh, I see. You sit out there all day with the others. Then you come in there with your head bowed, saying 'Forgive me, forgive me.' Well it's not that easy. Just because you need forgiveness don't ask me to do it.
JESUS=>Mary, I'm sorry.
MAGDALENE=>I don't want your pity. I'm fine, just fine. I don't need help from anybody. Especially you or your God.
JESUS=>God can save your soul.
MAGDALENE=>I don't want him. He's already broken my heart. Say the truth.
MAGDALENE=>You want to save my soul? This is where you'll find it. You're the same as the others only you can't admit it. You lie about it. You're pitiful. I hate you. Here's my body. Kiss it. Save it.
MAGDALENE=>Is that the way you show you're a man? You never had the courage to be one. If you weren't hanging onto your mother, you were hanging onto me. Now you're hanging onto God, going to the desert to hide because you're scared. Well go. Whenever I see you my heart breaks. Don't look at me.
MAGDALENE=>Is that the way you eat? Without thanking God? Don't you think you should thank him for giving you all this: bread, beans, whores, wine...
JESUS=>Let me eat and let me go.
MAGDALENE=>I remember when we were children. When I was five and you were three. I remember when we laid under the tree together. I watched you. Later I wanted you to come to me but not before you suffered...
JESUS=>Stop it.
MAGDALENE=>I never felt so much tenderness toward anyone as I felt for you then... all I ever wanted was you... nothing else.
JESUS=>And what do you think I wanted? Do you think I wanted this? God help me.
MAGDALENE=>To do what?
JESUS=>To leave.
MAGDALENE=>Please... stay. Here, it's cold. Sleep by the fire. Is it so bad, sharing a prostitute's room? You'll still have your virginity for the desert. I promise.
JESUS=>I can't stay, Mary. I'm sorry.
VOICE=>This way.
JESUS=>Do you pray this late at night?
MASTER=>It's a funeral. The Master of the monastery died.
JESUS=>I'll pray with you.
MASTER=>No. Sleep well. You must be tired. 'First came the wings and then the angel.' God be praised.
JEROBOAM=>Who are you? What are you doing here?
JESUS=>I was brought here.
JEROBOAM=>By who?
JESUS=>An old man.
JEROBOAM=>There are a lot of old men here. What was his name? Did he say anything?
JESUS=>He didn't say his name. He just said 'First came the wings and then the angel.' That was all he said.
JESUS=>This was the man who let me in last night. Did he just die?
JEROBOAM=>This was the Master of the monastery. He's been dead since yesterday morning. And you've come in his place.
JEROBOAM=>The Master's soul has gone to heaven, his body's work is completed. It walked under the sun and moon, over stone and sand, sinned, felt pain, yearned for heaven. We commend his remains to the earth and his soul to our God. Flesh, the Master no longer needs you. Melt away.
JEROBOAM=>In our period of mourning for the Master we believe we'll feel his presence here for forty days, advising us, scolding us. It actually appeared to you. And showed you the way to his room. His own room. He treated you like a royal visitor. He recognized you.
JESUS=>He couldn't have recognized me for anything. I only came here to serve God and nothing else. That's all he wants from me, I'm sure of it.
JEROBOAM=>God brought you here, didn't he?
JESUS=>All he brought here is my shame.
JEROBOAM=>Shame is also a temptation.
JESUS=>God hunts me. He drives his nails into my heart. He wants to push me over.
JESUS=>He wants me to speak. But he didn't touch my lips with burning coals. How can I speak? I sinned.
JEROBOAM=>We all sin.
JESUS=>Not my sins. What does He want from me? Can't he see what's inside me? All my sins. I'm Lucifer.
JEROBOAM=>Be quiet!
JESUS=>No! I'm a liar. A hypocrite. I'm afraid of everything. I never tell the truth. I don't have the courage. When I see a woman, I blush and look away. But inside I have lust. For God, I smother the lust, and that satisfies my pride. But my pride destroys Magdalene. I never steal or fight, or kill... not because I don't want to but because I'm afraid. I want to rebel against everything, everybody... against God!... but I'm afraid. If you look inside me you see fear, that's all. Fear is my mother, my father, my God.
JEROBOAM=>The more devils we have inside of us, the more chance we have to make angels. 'Angel' is the name for the devils who repent... so, you have to have faith. Have you ever slept with a woman?
JESUS=>No...
JEROBOAM=>And you don't want to?
JESUS=>I do... No, I don't.
JEROBOAM=>Why not?
JESUS=>It's not enough for me.
JEROBOAM=>Well, then what do you want? ...Why don't you answer me?
JESUS=>I am Saint Blasphemer, Father. So you'd better not ask me anything else, or I'll start my blasphemies.
JEROBOAM=>Start your blasphemies. You'll be relieved. Start.
JESUS=>There's Lucifer inside of me saying, You're not the son of the Carpenter, you're the son of King David. You're not a man, you're the son of man. And further: the son of God. And further than that: God.
JESUS=>Do you want to ask me anything else?
JEROBOAM=>No.
JESUS=>Why now after all this time? Coupling. This is why we were thrown out of Paradise.
MAGDALENE=>Jesus, I forgive you.
JESUS=>Leave me. Leave me alone.
JESUS=>They're gone.
JEROBOAM=>God has just blessed you. The snakes left. They came from you. Everything has two meanings, one obvious, the other hidden. Now maybe you have to leave.
JESUS=>I have to stay. That's what God wants me to do.
JEROBOAM=>I don't think you're supposed to stay. God is already talking to you. He must want something else.
JESUS=>What else could he want from me?
JEROBOAM=>He's purified you for a reason. To be his instrument. He must want to speak through you. Outside.
JESUS=>To who?
JEROBOAM=>To anyone who will listen.
JESUS=>And say what?
JEROBOAM=>Just open your mouth. You love mankind?
JESUS=>I see men and I feel sorry for them, that's all.
JEROBOAM=>That's enough. Go and speak to them.
JUDAS=>I hissed and you came.
JESUS=>I'm ready.
JUDAS=>Ready? You think we're going to a feast? I'm going to kill you.
JESUS=>Good. I'm relieved. I'm happy to see you. You're just in time.
JESUS=>God purified me tonight. I thought it was so I could go out and preach. But now I see. It's so I could die. And you're God's instrument. He brought us together.
JESUS=>Here's my neck. Cut it. Come on, cut it. What's the matter? Is there anything wrong? I was purified, you got your permission, it's all arranged by God. So what are you waiting for?
JESUS=>You can't do it, can you?
JUDAS=>I can if I want.
JESUS=>Why don't you want?
JUDAS=>I do want.
JESUS=>Fine.
JUDAS=>Did you work some magic on me? When I go to kill a man, I kill him.
JESUS=>Maybe God doesn't want me to die. If God really wanted me to die, you wouldn't hesitate. You'd just kill me.
JUDAS=>No, you should die. What good are you living? Why should God want you alive? What good are you for Israel? Do you have some secret?
JESUS=>I have no secret. I know that I have pity, though.
JUDAS=>Pity! How far will that get us? What good is that for Israel?
JESUS=>It's good for men.
JUDAS=>Men! The Greeks who killed us were men. So are the Romans. Don't pity men, pity Israel. The rest can go to hell.
JESUS=>I feel pity for everything. Donkeys, sparrows, grass.
JUDAS=>And ants? I suppose you feel pity for them too?
JESUS=>Yes. Everything's a part of God. When I look into the ant, into his shiny black eye, I see the face of God.
JUDAS=>What do you see when you look in my face?
JESUS=>I see God too.
JUDAS=>You see God everywhere, don't you? Maybe that's why you don't fear death.
JESUS=>Why should I fear death? Death isn't a door that closes, it's a door that opens. It opens and you enter.
JUDAS=>If I don't kill you, what happens?
JESUS=>I don't know. Whatever God decides. I'll speak to others. I can't think of anything else.
JUDAS=>What are you going to say?
JESUS=>I'll just open my mouth and God will do the talking.
JUDAS=>See. I told you. You're not crazy at all, are you? If God does talk through you, then you're the messenger of God and I can't kill a messenger of God, can I? You've got my hand stopped.
JESUS=>I didn't stop your hand, God did.
JUDAS=>He's the only one who could.
JESUS=>God didn't send you to kill me. Maybe he sent you here to follow me.
JUDAS=>The one's I follow are the ones who follow Israel.
JUDAS=>It's Magdalene. She deserves it.
MAN IN CROWD=>Get out of here. This isn't your business. You want to get hurt?
ZEBEDEE=>You heard what he said, idiot. Move.
JESUS=>No. I don't want this.
ZEBEDEE=>Oh, listen to this. He doesn't want this. Well, we want it.
JESUS=>Why?
ZEBEDEE=>We don't have to tell you why...
PETER=>Bad enough we live in a whorehouse. But does it have to be a Roman whorehouse? Our women can't even look in a mirror on the Sabbath, and this one goes with Romans on the Sabbath. She broke Moses' law. So she dies.
JESUS=>Who's never sinned? Which one of you has never sinned? Whichever one of you's never sinned should come up here and throw these.
ZEBEDEE=>I've got nothing to hide.
JESUS=>Good. Take one of these. They're bigger. You're not going to do much damage with the small one.
JESUS=>Be careful, Zebedee. There is a God. He's seen you cheat your workers. He's seen you with that widow, what's her name...
WOMAN IN THE CROWD=>Judith!
JESUS=>...Judith. Aren't you afraid God will paralyze you if your lift that stone? That your hand will wither and hang at your side?
JUDAS=>Follow us, follow the Rabbi. He wants to talk to you.
WOMAN IN CROWD=>Who is he?
MAN=>It's Jesus. From Nazareth.
SECOND MAN=>Nothing good can come out of Nazareth. Even the scriptures say it.
JESUS=>This is what I've always been afraid of. There's so much to say. God has so many miracles.
JESUS=>Come closer everybody. My brothers. My sisters. I'm calling you that because we're all a family. A little closer. My voice isn't very strong, and I've got something to tell you.
JESUS=>I'm sorry if I have to tell you stories. But is seems to be the only way I can tell you what I have to. A farmer was planting in his field. Some seed fell on the ground and the birds ate it. Some seed fell on rocks and dried up. But some seed fell on rich soil, grew into wheat and fed a lot of people.
JESUS=>Didn't you hear me? Are you people deaf?
ZEBEDEE=>We can hear fine. It's not us. Can't you be more... clear.
JESUS=>I'm the farmer. The farmer's me.
ZEBEDEE=>Wait a minute. I get it. Don't tell me. We must be the stones. We're the ground, is that it? That's just fine. And two and two makes four. Another lunatic.
JOHN=>Rabbi, tell me. If you're the farmer and we're the stones, what is the seed?
JOHN=>What's the seed?
JESUS=>Love one another. Love one another!
ANDREW=>Alright, let's say we accept that. Maybe that's even good advice. But for some other world. Not here. we're starving. Feed us first, then talk.
JUDAS=>What are you talking about, love? This is your message? We should all love the Romans? That's like putting our neck on the knife.
JESUS=>Listen, I used to think God was angry too. But not any more. He used to jump on me like a wild bird and dig his claws into my head. But then one morning he came to me. He blew over me like a cool breeze and said 'Stand up.' And here I am.
ZEBEDEE=>Go to hell!
MAN IN CROWD=>These are all stories for children. They can't help us.
JESUS=>What are you hungry for? And you, you're thirsty. What are you thirsty for? For justice. Justice.
ANDREW=>And bread.
JESUS=>Bread too, bread too. I'm telling you, whoever's hungry for justice, whoever's thirsty for justice... they're the one's who'll be blessed. They'll be filled with bread. They'll never be thirsty again.
JESUS=>And you. You're in mourning. But mourners will be blessed. You'll have God's comfort, you won't need it from men.
JESUS=>And the meek... they're the ones who'll be blessed. And the suffering... they'll be blessed too. and the merciful, and the peacemakers. And the poor, and the sick, and the outcasts... you will all be blessed. Because Heaven is yours.
JESUS=>But believe me. The ones who are laughing now...
JESUS=>...will be crying later. The ones who are fed now will be hungry soon. And the rich... will be poor forever.
FIRST VOICE=>Let's kill the rich!
SECOND VOICE=>Why bother with the rich? Kill the Romans.
JESUS=>I didn't say death. I said love! I said love!
ZEBEDEE=>Let's go.
JOHN=>No. Go on without me.
MAGDALENE=>Rabbi. I can help. Let me go with you.
JESUS=>No. Stay here. Tell people about me. Show them how to live.
ZEBEDEE=>Where have you been? We've been working all morning.
JOHN=>What are you doing this for, after what we heard. Come with us.
ZEBEDEE=>What do you think you're doing?
JUDAS=>Watch it, Zebedee, you'll lose another son.
JESUS=>Zebedee, do you really need them? You can hire other men. They won't be your sons, so you'll have to pay them...
ZEBEDEE=>Pay them! I can't afford to pay them. I can't afford to pay anybody. Look, my nets have been empty for weeks.
JESUS=>Look at them now.
ZEBEDEE=>How'd you do that?
JESUS=>Maybe the current changed. Zebedee, let your sons come with me. They can fish for men.
JUDAS=>Rabbi, can I talk to you?
JUDAS=>I'm not like these other men. I mean, they're good enough. But they're weak. How are they going to fight for you? They couldn't even fight for themselves. Where'd you find them? One's worse than the other. This is no army.
JESUS=>I don't need soldiers.
JUDAS=>You wanted me. And if I love somebody, I'd die for them. If I hate somebody, I'll kill them. I can even kill somebody I love if he does the wrong thing. Do you understand?
JESUS=>I understand.
JUDAS=>The other day when you said turn the other cheek to the man that hit you, I didn't like that. Only an angel could do that, only an angel or a dog. I'm a free man. I don't turn my cheek to anyone. You do need soldiers.
JESUS=>Will soldiers make me free?
JUDAS=>You want freedom for Israel?
JESUS=>I want freedom for the soul.
JUDAS=>First you free the body, then the soul. You know that. The Romans come first.
JESUS=>The soul is first. If you don't change what the soul needs, you'll only replace Roman domination with another domination and nothing'll ever change. First you have to change man inside. Then man can change what's around him. It's wanting wealth and power that makes the soul want to dominate others. That's the wanting we have to change, we have to free the soul first. With love.
JUDAS=>We all want that eventually. But right now the only way is to start from the bottom. You build a house from the foundation up... Who's there?
ANDREW=>It's me, Andrew. Is everything...
JESUS=>Go back to sleep. Judas and I are talking.
JUDAS=>I still don't know who you are.
JESUS=>Neither do I.
JUDAS=>You can't look to the others for answers. All they can do is follow you. It's between you and me. When I went to kill you in the monastery, God took my strength away. That's what made me think, even if I didn't want to... that's what made me think you might be the one. The Messiah. Maybe you are, maybe you aren't, maybe you don't even know yourself if you are. That's why I said to myself, be patient for once in your life. See what he does, see what he says, and if he's not the Messiah there's plenty of time to kill him.
JESUS=>How can I be the Messiah? First of all I wanted to kill those people when I saw them torturing Magdalene. Then when I opened my mouth, out came the word 'love.' Why? How can we tell?
JUDAS=>Alright. You say God talks through you and right now I believe you. There's another one he talks through.
JESUS=>The Baptist.
JUDAS=>We'll go to see him. He stands out there every day preaching 'He is coming, he is coming.' As soon as he sees you he'll know who you are. He'll know if you're the one.
JESUS=>I'm afraid, Judas. Stay here.
ANDREW=>Up ahead. The water forms a pool in the caves. I'll show you.
JESUS=>You're tired. Stay here.
ANDREW=>No, I'd better come. It could be dangerous.
JESUS=>NO. I want to go alone.
JUDAS=>What about me! I'm supposed to be with you.
JESUS=>Come on.
THE BAPTIST=>'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house, and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.'
THE BAPTIST=>"Roll on the ground, bite the dust, howl! The Lord of Hosts says: 'On this day I will command the sun to set at noon; I will crush the horns of the new moon and spill darkness over the earth. I will reverse your laughter, turn it into tears, and your songs I will turn into lamentations. I will blow and all your finery -- hands, feet, noses, ears, hairs -- will fall to the ground.'"
JUDAS=>God. He sounds like the Messiah.
JESUS=>No, the Messiah won't have an ax in his hand.
JUDAS=>We'll see. Go in front. Let him see you.
JESUS=>Even from behind, I knew I had seen him before. Where? When? Was it a dream? Yes, it was. But in the dream he was all dressed in white.
THE BAPTIST=>Who are you?
JESUS=>Do you recognize me?
THE BAPTIST=>Who are you?
JESUS=>Have you read Isaiah? Do you know the prophets? What does Isaiah say?
THE BAPTIST=>He says, "Prepare the way of the Lord." Are you telling me that's you?
JESUS=>I don't know. Tell me.
THE BAPTIST=>Why are you here?
JESUS=>To be baptized.
THE BAPTIST=>I don't dare. If you are the Master, you should baptize me.
JESUS=>Baptize me.
JESUS=>Isn't love enough?
THE BAPTIST=>No. The tree is rotten. You have to take the ax and cut it down.
JESUS=>If I was a woodcutter, I'd cut. If I was fire, I'd burn. But I'm a heart and I love.
THE BAPTIST=>I'm a heart also but I can't love what's unjust. I can't love evil. What I can't love I attack. God demands it. God demands anger.
JESUS=>Anger? Aren't we all brothers?
THE BAPTIST=>You think love is God's only way? Go to the Dead Sea. Look in the bottom, you'll see the two whores, Sodom and Gomorrah. God was angry. He threw fire at them, turned over the dry land and the sea swallowed them up. That's God's way. 'On the day of the Lord, blood will flow from wood, the stones of the houses will come alive and kill their owners!' That day is here. He gave me the ax, now I give it to you.
JESUS=>That's not the answer.
THE BAPTIST=>No? Then what is the answer?
JESUS=>I don't know. I think it's love.
THE BAPTIST=>Well I know. And if you won't listen to me who will you listen to? To God? The God of Israel's a god of the desert. If you want to speak to him, then you go to the desert.
JESUS=>I'll go to Idumaea.
THE BAPTIST=>But be careful. The desert's full of sweet voices and death.
JESUS=>Thank you Baptist.
JESUS=>His tongue felt like a burning coal in my mouth.
JESUS=>I'm not going to leave this circle. I won't leave until you talk to me. No hums. No thunder. No headaches. Just talk to me in human words. Whatever path you want, I'll take. Love or the ax or anything else. Or if you want me to stay here and die I'll do that too. But you have to tell me.
JESUS=>I don't want... I don't want to be alone.
SERPENT=>I felt sorry for you. You were lonely. You cried, so I came.
JESUS=>I didn't call you. Who are you?
SERPENT=>Your soul.
JESUS=>My soul.
SERPENT=>You're afraid of being alone. Just like Adam. He called me and I reached into his ribs and gave him a wife.
JESUS=>You're here to trick me.
SERPENT=>Trick you? To love and care for a woman? To have a family -- this is a trick? Why are you trying to save the world? Aren't your own sins enough for you? What arrogance to think it's your duty to save the world. The world doesn't have to be saved. Find love.
JESUS=>I have love.
SERPENT=>Look into my eyes, look at my breasts...
SERPENT=>...Do you recognize them? Say the word. Nod your head and we'll be in my bed together.
SERPENT=>Oh, Jesus.
JESUS=>After ten days the hunger went away.
LION=>Welcome, Jesus. Congratulations. You've overcome the small temptations of a woman, a family. We're both bigger than that. A woman's not enough, we need the whole world.
JESUS=>Who are you?
LION=>I'm you. I'm your heart. Your heart is so hungry. It pretends to be humble but it secretly wants to conquer the world. I will set my four feet down, one in Babylon, one in Jerusalem, one in Alexandria, the last in Rome.
JESUS=>I've never wanted a kingdom on earth. The Kingdom of Heaven's good enough for me.
LION=>You're a liar. You've always wanted power. When you were making crosses for the Romans in Nazareth, your head was exploding with dreams of power. You said it was God, but you really wanted to rule others. Now you will. Any country you want. All countries. You will rule Babylon. You will rule Jerusalem. You will rule Alexandria. You will even rule Rome.
JESUS=>Liar! Step into my circle so I can pull out your tongue.
JESUS=>Archangel... go farther back. You're blinding me.
ARCHANGEL=>I'm the one you've been waiting for. Remember when you were a child, you cried, 'Make me a God. God, make me a God.'
JESUS=>But I was just a child then.
ARCHANGEL=>Adonai. You are God. The Baptist knew it. It's time you admit it. I salute you, Son, only Son of God. Join me in power. We will rule together over the living and the dead. You'll give life and take life. You'll sit on the throne and I'll sit at your hand. Imagine how strong we could be together.
JESUS=>Satan!
ANGEL=>We'll see each other again.
THE BAPTIST=>Don't be afraid. You are the One. I was the one who came before you. My work is finished. Now I can die. The Lord wants me to tell you to stand up, his day is here. Take the ax. Run and carry the message to men.
JESUS=>I'm a foreigner. From Galilee. I need rest. The door was open. Excuse me... I...
MARY=>We're alone. Our brother Lazarus is out.
MARTHA=>What difference does that make? Come in. Don't listen to her. She's afraid of her own shadow. I'm Martha and this is my sister, Mary. There's not much here, but you're welcome to it. Who are you?
JESUS=>Jesus of Nazareth.
MARTHA=>A good man?
JESUS=>Yes, good.
JESUS=>...I do my best.
JESUS=>Martha. Mary. I swear to you if there's another flood and if it's up to me to invite you into the ark, I'd do it. You'd both be on it. Because tonight a stranger came to your door. You fed him, dressed him, made him comfortable, spoke kindly to him, and the Kingdom of Heaven came down and went in his heart.
MARY=>Go on.
JESUS=>What should I say? Silence is good, It says everything.
MARY=>It doesn't say everything to me. A kind word now and then helps.
MARTHA=>Do you have a wife?
JESUS=>No.
MARY=>If you only knew what goes through a woman's mind when she weaves. You'd pity her, Jesus.
JESUS=>I do know. I was once a woman, in another life, and I used to weave.
MARY=>And what did you think about?
JESUS=>God. And you?
MARTHA=>God. But we think about men more.
MARY=>God is a man after all. And men can be husbands.
JESUS=>You know the Baptist? He died, didn't he?
MARY=>He was killed... by Herod. You didn't know?
JESUS=>No... I knew.
MARTHA=>They say the King was drunk and cut off his head to satisfy a little girl... It happened in his palace in Jerusalem.
MARY=>No, at his palace in Tiberias.
JESUS=>Jerusalem.
MARTHA=>Is that where you're going, to Jerusalem?
MARY=>I envy you.
JESUS=>Not now. Eventually.
JAMES=>Now they say they're going to kill everyone who was baptized.
PHILIP=>Nobody told you to get baptized.
PETER=>You were baptized too. You begged for it. So be quiet.
JAMES=>I can just imagine Galilee right now. The sea... I hear the fishing is so good that you just touch the nets and the fish jump in.
NATHANIEL=>Don't talk about fish. It reminds me of my sheep. I don't know what's happened to them.
PETER=>Maybe we should wait for him in Galilee.
JAMES=>We promised the Master we'd wait here for him.
NATHANIEL=>That was a month ago. He talks to the Baptist, then disappears.
JOHN=>Brothers. I don't understand you. Think of the last words the Baptist said. He said 'Jesus of Nazareth, leave the desert. I am finished. Return to mankind!'
PHILIP=>How do you know the Baptist really said that?
JOHN=>Everybody says he did. But even if he didn't say it, those words are important because people believe them. I don't want to blaspheme, but what if our Master... what if he's the one?
JAMES=>What one?
JOHN=>The one.
PHILIP=>But we don't know if the Baptist really said that. I mean, what if...
JUDAS=>We're waiting here!
PETER=>I don't know now. I don't think we should go to Galilee. We should wait here, maybe.
JUDAS=>Changed your mind when you heard what John said, uh? 'The one?' That's what I like about you Peter, nobody can change your mind. Not you. What good are you?!
JOHN=>Master.
PETER=>Rabbi. John heard your foot-steps in his heart... in a way... and we were just preparing to welcome you.
JESUS=>Were you baptized?
PETER=>Yes.
JESUS=>John baptized with water and they killed him. Now I'll baptize with fire.
JUDAS=>Is that what the Baptist told you?
JESUS=>I have an invitation for you.
PETER=>Is there a celebration?
JESUS=>No, I'm not inviting you to a celebration. I'm inviting you to a war.
JESUS=>This is my heart. Take it. I lead the way to the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God's inside us. It's the Devil's kingdom that's outside, all around us. We'll turn an ax against the Devil's kingdom, against the world. If you have sheep, give them away. If you have nets, let them rot. If you have a family, children, leave them behind.
JESUS=>I once believed in love, now I carry this. Who's with me?
JUDAS=>Adonai!
JESUS=>Satan! Leave them! Get out!
JESUS=>Moses, Elijah, Isaiah -- touch my mouth, touch my lips.
JESUS=>Go to the temple. Let the high priests see you.
OLD MAN=>You don't belong at a wedding. We're here to celebrate purity.
JESUS=>Listen to me. What do you think the Kingdom of Heaven's like? It's like a wedding. God's the Bridegroom and Man's soul is the Bride. The wedding takes place in Heaven and everyone's invited. God's Kingdom is large enough for everybody.
OLD MAN=>Nazarene, that's against the law.
JESUS=>The Law is against my heart.
JAMES=>Nathaniel, what's wrong.
NATHANIEL=>I didn't buy enough wine. More people came and stayed late and now we've run out.
JESUS=>What's in those?
NATHANIEL=>Water.
JESUS=>No. It's wine.
NATHANIEL=>No, no. It's water.
JESUS=>Go over there and make sure. It's wine, I'm telling you.
NATHANIEL=>You're right. It is wine.
JAMES=>It's another miracle.
JESUS=>Brothers! Sisters! My old friends! Listen to me! Listen to me.
JESUS=>The prophet was talking about me. God talked to me in the desert. He gave me a great secret and told me to bring it to you -- didn't you hear me coming? I ran here first -- to Nazareth -- where I grew up -- to give you the news. The Lord's Kingdom is here.
JESUS=>The Messiah doesn't need miracles. He is the miracle. The Day of the Lord is here. Are you ready? I've come to tear down the world around you. The old world will be replaced by the new world. The Kingdom of Heaven! The Kingdom of God! So call the poor and give them your food. What do you care about your possessions? Your gold and silver will rust and their rust will eat your flesh like fire. Flood and fire will come down, and the new Ark will float above the flames. I hold the keys and I open the Ark and I select. My brothers of Nazareth, you're the first I invite. Come and enter.
JESUS=>What are you laughing at? Everything you have will burn!! Soon! Leave your homes! Come with me to Jerusalem!
JESUS=>This is my home!
PETER=>What are you doing that for? That's a shame.
POOR VILLAGER=>Don't touch him! God's Kingdom is for the poor. It's our Kingdom!
JESUS=>If I could touch every stone, breathe on every twig, they would rise up and join me! Come with me! Jerusalem is falling. I can feel it!
JESUS=>See these misfits. They're crippled, they're blind, they're poor. That's our army. They shout and the Old Jerusalem will fall.
JUDAS=>We'll need more men than this.
JESUS=>God will provide them. We're going to build a New Jerusalem.
MARY=>Son. Please. Come back with me.
JESUS=>Who are you woman?
MARY=>You know who I am. Don't you recognize me? I'm your mother.
JESUS=>I have no mother. I have no family. Only my father who's in heaven. Get away from me.
WOMAN=>Mary... why are you crying? Didn't you see them?
MARY=>See what?
WOMAN=>When he spoke to you, thousands of blue wings, behind him, I swear to you Mary, there were armies of angels.
MARY=>I didn't see anything. What good are angels to me? I wanted children and grand-children behind him, not angels.
MARTHA=>Rabbi, forgive us. Our brother Lazarus is very sick.
MARY=>We heard you've healed the sick, made cripples walk, that you preformed miracles...
JESUS=>Take me to him.
JESUS=>When was he buried?
BETHANY WOMAN=>Three days ago.
JESUS=>Roll the stone away.
JESUS=>What can I do? How much can I do?
JESUS=>Lazarus! In the name of the prophets, in the name of Jeremiah and my Father, in the name of most Holy God, I demand that you rise and come out!
LAZARUS=>Adonai.
JESUS=>Is the power of God so strong? If it can raise the dead, can it also move mountains? Can it destroy Rome? Tear the world in half? God help me.
JESUS=>We came here to pray. What is this?
PETER=>The money-changers? Its' for the temple tax... for the feast.
JESUS=>How's the exchange today? Making a good profit?
MONEY-CHANGER=>Fair. Can I help you?
JESUS=>This is my Father's house. It's a place for worship, not a bank, or a market.
RABBI=>Nazarene, what are you doing?
JESUS=>God doesn't need a grand house. He doesn't need cyprus and bloody animals. He doesn't need shekels.
RABBI=>You expect people to pay the tax in Roman coins? They have images of false gods on them. You want pagan gods in the temple? All foreign coins have to be changed to shekels. That the law.
JESUS=>I abolish the law. I give a new law and a new hope!
RABBI=>What, did God change his mind about the old law?
JESUS=>No, no. He just thinks our hearts are ready now to hold more.
RABBI=>This chaos is your new law? How can you presume...
JESUS=>How can I presume? Because I am the fulfillment of the old law and the beginning of the new.
SADDUCEE=>Watch what you're saying.
PETER=>Maybe we should go...
JESUS=>When I say, 'I,' Rabbi, I am saying 'God.'
RABBI=>That's blasphemy!
JESUS=>Didn't you hear? I'm the Saint of Blasphemy. Don't make any mistakes. I haven't come to bring peace, I've come to bring a sword.
SADDUCEE=>Talking like that will get you killed.
JESUS=>I'm sick of all of you. This temple will be destroyed in three days. One stone won't be left standing on another. You think God belongs only to you?! He doesn't! God's an immortal spirit and belongs to everybody -- to the whole world. You're not special! God is not an Israelite!
JESUS=>Get away. You sicken me. You're selfish! You're full of hate! God won't help you.
JESUS=>You don't demand from God!
ROMAN OFFICER=>You, all of you stop. Which one of you is Jesus of Nazareth?
JESUS=>I am.
ROMAN OFFICER=>Come with us. The Procurator wants to see you.
SAUL=>We need you. What are you doing with this magician? First you were supposed to kill him. Now he acts like a prophet and you follow him.
JUDAS=>What are you saying? Didn't you just hear him?
SAUL=>I heard him. He talks about a new law, he talks about using a sword. But we took an oath to use the sword against Rome. I don't see anything against Rome here. All I see here is Jew against Jew.
PILATE=>Are you Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews?
JESUS=>I'm no king.
PILATE=>You aren't the Messiah? They say you are. You say you are.
JESUS=>My kingdom's not on this earth.
PILATE=>Oh? Where is it then? In the air, maybe?
JESUS=>In heaven.
PILATE=>Good. Keep it there. They tell me you do miracles. Is this good magic or bad magic? Can you do a trick for us?
JESUS=>I'm not a pet. I don't do tricks.
PILATE=>That's disappointing. I was hoping to see something.
JESUS=>The prophet Daniel had a vision. A huge statue had a gold head, and silver shoulders...
PILATE=>Don't tell me stories. I'm not a dumb Jew.
JESUS=>Listen. Learn.
PILATE=>Go ahead. Teach me something.
JESUS=>The stomach was bronze, the legs were iron, the feet were clay. A stone was thrown. The clay feet broke and the statue collapsed.
PILATE=>Is that it?
JESUS=>God is the thrower. I'm the stone. Rome is the statue.
PILATE=>Clearly. But that's how you're going to bring down the Roman Empire? One stone? Only you?
JESUS=>God, give me the answer. I don't know what to say.
PILATE=>No answer?
JESUS=>Please speak to me. I need words.
PILATE=>You're not a stone. You're excrement. Get him out of here.
PILATE=>And my wife dreams about you. She should see you now.
VOICE=>Lazarus. Lazarus.
SAUL=>Feeling better?
LAZARUS=>I like the light.
SAUL=>What was it like? Which is better, life or death?
LAZARUS=>Well, I was a little surprised. There wasn't that much difference...
SAUL=>Well, let me help you make up your mind.
JUDAS=>I've been looking all over for you. For two days. We're really worried about you. I have to tell you. They killed Lazarus.
JESUS=>Who?
JUDAS=>Zealots.
JESUS=>Your people. Why?
JUDAS=>Because he was the living proof of your power. Zealots say you're paid by the Romans to tell the people only heaven is important. Not their life now. Not being dominated by Romans. That's very dangerous.
JESUS=>Yes. It make everything clearer.
JUDAS=>Clearer? What are you talking about, clearer? It just makes everything worse. We want a revolution, the Zealots want a revolution but now they're against us. We can't let that happen. We need them.
JESUS=>Do you want to join them, then?
JUDAS=>No. They're my brothers, but you're my master.
JESUS=>You are the strongest, aren't you? Of all my friends, you're the strongest. I have to tell you something.
JUDAS=>Tell me whatever you want. You can depend on me.
JESUS=>You know why I came to Jerusalem?
JUDAS=>This is where we're going to fight. This is where the revolution's going to happen.
JESUS=>Last night Isaiah came to me.
JUDAS=>What did he say?
JESUS=>He opened his book and I read in giant letters: 'He has borne our faults; he was wounded for our transgressions. He was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. Despised and rejected by all, he went forward without resisting, like a lamb led to the slaughter.'
JUDAS=>So? What does that have to do with you?
JESUS=>Judas. I'm the lamb. I'm the one who is going to die.
JUDAS=>What do you mean, die? Die? Did you change your mind again.
JESUS=>No.
JUDAS=>Then what are you talking about? That can't be. If you're the Messiah, why do you have to die?
JESUS=>Don't shout. You'll understand soon. At first I didn't understand myself.
JUDAS=>Every day you have a different plan. I can't believe it. First it's love, then it's the ax, now you have to die. What good could that do. We need you alive.
JESUS=>I can't help it. God only talks to me a little at a time. He only shows me as much as I have to know. Now I finally understand. All my life. All my life I've been followed. By footsteps. By voices. By headaches. By shadows. And you know what the shadow is? It's the cross. I have to die on the cross. And I have to die willingly... We need courage, Judas. We need faith. I'm the fulfillment of the prophecy. The cross is the way I have to take.
JESUS=>So we go to Jerusalem. We go back to the temple. Whatever happens there will put me on the cross.
JUDAS=>And after you die on the cross? What happens then?
JESUS=>I'll come back to judge the living and the dead.
JUDAS=>I don't believe you.
JESUS=>If you don't believe, nobody will. You have to believe. You're the strongest.
JAMES=>I'm worried he's going to change his mind again.
JUDAS=>No he won't. We're taking the temple.
JAMES=>What if we don't.
JUDAS=>We'll die.
JAMES=>There aren't many of us. And nobody back there looks like a soldier.
JUDAS=>God will provide.
NATHANIEL=>What do you want?
PHILIP=>What do you mean?
NATHANIEL=>When we build the New Jerusalem and set up the new government.
PHILIP=>Well, I guess I'd like more sheep. You know, my other sheep, I don't even know where they are now. This time I want a large herd. I'd hire other shepherds to take care of them. You know, Laban, that man who has a large farm north of Tiberias? I'd like one like that.
NATHANIEL=>Yeah.
PHILIP=>How about you?
NATHANIEL=>First, I'd like to be able to worship in the temple. I mean really worship -- without Roman banners and soldiers standing around.
PHILIP=>Of course. But what else?
THOMAS=>I'm not afraid.
JOHN=>Then don't act like it.
THOMAS=>I'll do anything the Master asks... anything but get crucified.
ANDREW=>You're a coward.
THOMAS=>Call me a coward after you've been hanging up there for two days and the crows come and suck out your eyes.
JOHN=>I made my decision. If you can't make yours, leave now before we enter the Kingdom.
THOMAS=>I'm ready. I have my knife.
PETER=>I've been talking with the others, and listening, and a lot of us are a little concerned, we're wondering... well... will you have legions of angels meeting us there? Or anyone? Besides who's here?
JESUS=>Get out! Away!
JESUS=>Lord, I hope this is what you want. Please let it happen quickly, while I have the strength.
JESUS=>I am here to set fire to the world! In the desert The Baptist said, 'Repent, Repent! The day of the Lord is coming!' but I'm saying it's too late to repent. The Day of the Lord's already here! I am the Day of the Lord. I come with the baptism of fire!
PETER=>Let's go! Now's the time!
JUDAS=>They're all with you! They're waiting for your signal! Give it!
PETER=>Come on! Now!
JESUS=>Please. I'm waiting too. Put the ax in my hands. Not the cross. Let me die like this.
JOHN=>If you don't give the sign now, we're finished. We'll be killed for what we did today.
PHILIP=>We came here to fight, not to die!
JUDAS=>Master, we knew they would be strong! We knew it would be like this.
JESUS=>Judas. Come beside me.
JESUS=>Stay by my side.
JUDAS=>There's got to be something else you can do.
JESUS=>I wish there was. At the temple I prayed. I prayed to die. But it's not God's will. I have to die on the cross. I prayed out of weakness and I'm weakening even more. You've got to give me strength.
JUDAS=>I won't let you die.
JESUS=>You've got to. There's no other way. The world around us is Satan's world. It will be destroyed! The world of God will come! But only by my dying! By my sacrifice on the cross! Forget everything else! Understand that.
JUDAS=>No I can't. I'm not strong enough.
JESUS=>You are. You're the strongest. You're part of God's plan too. You once made me a promise. You said if I ever strayed, if I ever shied away from revolution, you would kill me. Remember?
JESUS=>I've strayed, haven't I?
JUDAS=>Yes.
JESUS=>Then you have to keep your word. You have to kill me.
JUDAS=>If God wants that, then let God do it. I won't.
JESUS=>He will do it. Through you. The Temple Guards want to arrest me where there aren't any crowds. Tonight we'll be in Gethsemane. Arrange for them to find me. It will be terrible. But only for three days. Only three days! Then I'll come back. We'll all be together in triumph.
JUDAS=>No.
JESUS=>You've got to! Don't abandon me now. Without you, the world can't be saved, There'll be no redemption. Without us together, the sacrifice can't be made.
JUDAS=>Could you betray God? If you were me, could you betray your Master?
JESUS=>No. That's why God gave me the easier job... to be crucified.
JESUS=>Our ancestors in Egypt celebrated Passover before they escaped to the freedom of the desert. On this Passover we come out of another kind of slavery and enter another kind of freedom.
PHILIP=>Oh, please. We're hiding here like criminals, we can't go out the door, and even if we could we wouldn't want to because we've been so humiliated, we'd like to respect you...
JOHN=>Respect him? We love him.
PHILIP=>...yes, alright, yes, we love him, that goes without saying, but at least he could...
JESUS=>First... first... first we drink salt water to remember the tears and pain our ancestors suffered in the land of Israel.
JESUS=>Tonight we go further. This passover celebrates the passage from death to eternal life. I'll lead the way, you will follow. John, you know the prophets. Isaiah says, 'He had neither beauty nor luster that we should turn our eyes to him. He was despised and rejected by men...'
JOHN=>'...But he took on himself all our pains. He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our inequities, and with his stripes we are healed.'
JESUS=>'...He was scourged and he was afflicted. Yet, like a lamb led to the slaughter, he opened not his mouth.' My dear, wonderful friends. I am the lamb. And I won't open my mouth. They've been leading me to the slaughter ever since I was born.
PETER=>If you die, I'll die first. Because I'll be at your side.
JESUS=>Be quiet. What did you have before I found you? All of you. Nothing. Now you have God's love -- and eternal life. Don't worry. You won't die yet. There's still a lot of work to do. We haven't come to rule, but to serve. In three days I'll rise from the dead to lead you.
JESUS=>Eat, this is my body. Drink, this is my blood. I will be in you always.
PETER=>Judas, where are you going? Where's he going?
JESUS=>Don't get in the way. Tonight we'll go to Gethsemane to pray.
JESUS=>Wait for me here.
JESUS=>Father, Father in heaven. Father on earth. The world you created that we can see is beautiful. But the world you created that we can't see is beautiful too. I don't know -- forgive me -- Father, I don't know which is the more beautiful.
JESUS=>This is my body too. Together we will die.
JESUS=>Abba, Father, we've been together a long time. I never asked to be chosen, but, I always obeyed. You've done many miracles for others. You opened the Red Sea for Moses. You saved Noah. You took Elijah directly to heaven in a fiery chariot. Now you ask me to be crucified. Can I ask you one last time? Do I have to die? Is there any other way? Do I have to drink from this cup? Can't you take it away from me?
JESUS=>Is this your answer?
JESUS=>Your will be done. I only ask for strength.
JESUS=>Couldn't you stay awake with me for just an hour?
PETER=>I'm sorry.
JESUS=>It doesn't matter. It's too late.
JUDAS=>Welcome, Rabbi.
JESUS=>No. You live by this, you die by it.
JESUS=>Welcome. You're the messengers of God. Let's go.
PILATE=>You're back. Hello. So now you're a king. Is that right?
PILATE=>Don't look in the air. Look at me. Answer me. I can crucify you. You know that? Now... are you a king?
JESUS=>Some say so.
PILATE=>Ah yes. Well last time you took that line with me, you fooled me. I don't like to be fooled. What you did in the temple makes it very clear. You're just another of these religious revolutionaries making difficulties. You take the people into the desert, you talk about God, love, mercy and the new kingdom, but you're just the same as the Zealots. You all promise glory and bring death. There's a new Messiah every week and a new one dies every week and Rome continues.
JESUS=>Remember the statue. And the stone. And the clay feet.
PILATE=>How could I forget. Still think your kingdom will replace Rome?
JESUS=>No. My kingdom is not on earth.
PILATE=>No, it wouldn't be. You're a little smarter than the others. After all, what's a revolution on earth compared to a revolution in people's hearts?
JESUS=>It's a revolution that will come with love, not by the sword.
PILATE=>Either way it's dangerous. It's against Rome. It's against the way the world is. And either way, I don't care. Sword or love, it's all the same. I don't care how you want to change things. We don't want them changed. So you know what has to happen. We have a small space for you up on Golgotha. Right next to the bones of your predecessors. Three thousand skulls there, very likely more by now. Maybe you people should go out and count them sometime. Maybe then you'd learn your lesson. But probably not.
PILATE=>Do you gentlemen have anything to add?
SADDUCEE=>We can't condone the killing of any Jew. But everything this man does and everything he says could lead to revolution. We don't want revolution. Action against a power like Rome is hopeless. It invites reprisals that would mean the extinction of the Jewish people. It's the death of one man against the death of millions. There's no alternative for us.
PHARISEE=>Many of our own people believe this man is being paid by Rome anyway.
PILATE=>Fine. It's agreed. But just so people appreciate your rank, we'll write it all out for them. "King of the Jews."
BEGGAR=>I've seen you. You're one of his followers.
PETER=>No. It must be somebody else.
BEGGAR=>No, it's you.
PETER=>You don't know what you're talking about.
JESUS=>Mother? Magdalene? Where are you?
JESUS=>Forgive me for being a bad son.
FIRST SOLDIER=>Alright, You Majesty, on your throne.
JESUS=>Don't dessert me here. Don't leave me.
JESUS=>Father, forgive them.
JESUS=>Eli, Eli...
JESUS=>Who are you?
JESUS=>Are you my father?
ANGEL=>No, but I was sent by him. I'm the angel who guards you.
ANGEL=>Your father is the God of Mercy, not punishment. He saw you and said, 'Aren't you his Guardian Angel? Well, go down and save him. He's suffered enough.' Remember when he told Abraham to sacrifice his son? Just as Abraham lifted his knife, God saved Isaac. If he saved Abraham's son, don't you think he'd want to save his own? He tested you, and he's pleased. He doesn't want your blood. He said, "Let him die in a dream. But let him have his life." Come with me.
JESUS=>All this pain is a dream?
ANGEL=>Just a dream.
JESUS=>I don't have to be sacrificed.
ANGEL=>No. No you don't.
JESUS=>I'm not the Messiah.
ANGEL=>No. No you're not.
JESUS=>Thank God.
JESUS=>What about all the others?
ANGEL=>Don't look behind, God gave you the gift of life. Look ahead.
JESUS=>But what about the people? What will happen?
ANGEL=>They can see you crucified. Or they'll see you dead. Or they can see you any way they want.
JESUS=>What happens later if they see me alive?
ANGEL=>They'll see any one you want them to see. Even you. If you want.
JESUS=>Where are the disciples?
ANGEL=>Oh, they were frightened and ran away.
JESUS=>Is this the Kingdom of God I spoke about?
ANGEL=>No, this is earth.
JESUS=>Why has it changed so much?
ANGEL=>It hasn't changed, you have. Now, you can see its real beauty. Harmony between the earth and the heart, that's the Kingdom of Heaven. Maybe you'll find this hard to believe. But we angels often look down on man and envy you.
JESUS=>What is this?
ANGEL=>A wedding ceremony.
JESUS=>Who's getting married?
ANGEL=>You are.
JESUS=>What's wrong? Why are you crying?
MAGDALENE=>I'm thanking God for bringing you here.
MAGDALENE=>We can have a child.
JESUS=>Yes.
ANGEL=>Bless you, children.
MAGDALENE=>Death is kind.
JESUS=>Magdalene...
ANGEL=>Where are you going?
ANGEL=>Who are you going to kill, Jesus?
ANGEL=>God. Are you going to kill God?
ANGEL=>It was God who killed her.
ANGEL=>God took her at the height of her happiness. Now she's immortal. She won't see her love fade or her flesh rot away. Can she be happier? I was there the whole time he was killing her and I saw what happened.
JESUS=>But it wasn't right... it wasn't right for him to kill her.
ANGEL=>You didn't question God when he let you live. You can't question why he let her die. Be patient. Trust in God's way. Listen, only one woman exists in the world, one woman with many faces. This one falls, the next one gets up. Mary Magdalene died, Mary, Lazarus' sister lives. She's Magdalene with a different face. She's carrying your greatest joy inside her. Your son. Come with me.
ANGEL=>This is the way the Savior comes: gradually -- from embrace to embrace -- from son to son. This is the road.
JESUS=>I understand...
MARTHA=>Oh, Mary look!
MARY=>Rabbi, I want to see if it's really you.
MARTHA=>It's real flesh -- like us. Don't you see? And look, there's a shadow on our doorstep.
JESUS=>Come in.
ANGEL=>Come here.
ANGEL=>Master, I'm sorry about Magdalene. I'll never leave you alone again. I'll always protect you. I don't want you to take the wrong road again and get lost.
MARTHA=>You must be hungry. I'll cook for you and your friend.
MARTHA=>Rabbi, I like your friend.
JESUS=>Nothing was enough for me before. And now look at this. Can you believe it? A small house is big enough for me, some bread, some friends. I'm not going to fight with God anymore. I'm not going to build crosses anymore. I'm going to build cradles and beds.
ANGEL=>Are you satisfied with me? Do you have any complaints?
JESUS=>None. I'm ashamed when I think of it.
ANGEL=>Of what?
JESUS=>What a twisted road I took to find God.
ANGEL=>Don't worry. I won't leave you. I like you.
JESUS=>Where's Mary?
MARTHA=>In the olive groves. She won't be back until this evening.
MARTHA=>Let's go inside. It's too hot out here.
MARTHA=>Come inside.
ANGEL=>There's only one woman in the world. Go inside.
JESUS=>Watch the children.
JESUS=>Don't forget to thank God for the food and make sure you save me some.
ANGEL=>Aren't you going to dinner?
JESUS=>I'll be back soon. I want to hear what he's saying.
ANGEL=>You don't have to go there...
PAUL=>I used to be a sinner. The worst sinner. I did everything. Whored, drank, murdered. I killed anyone who violated the Law of Moses. Then, I was struck by a burning light and a voice called to me, 'Saul, why are you persecuting me? Why are you against me?' 'Who are you?' I said. 'Jesus,' the voice said, and he gave me my sight. I opened my eyes and I was baptized and became Paul. I bring the good news to every country.
PAUL=>I bring this news. About Jesus of Nazareth. He wasn't the son of Mary, he was the son of God. His mother was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came to earth and put God's seed in her womb. That's how he was born. He took on our sins, he was tortured, crucified -- but three days later he rose again and was taken up to heaven. Death was conquered, praise God! Death was conquered, sins were forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven's now open to everyone.
JESUS=>Did you ever see this resurrected Jesus of Nazareth? I mean, with your own eyes?
PAUL=>No. But I saw a blinding flash of light and I heard his voice.
JESUS=>You're a liar!
PAUL=>His disciples saw him. They were hiding in an attic with the doors locked when suddenly he appeared. Only one, Thomas, wasn't convinced but he put his fingers in his wounds and gave Jesus some fish, which he ate.
JESUS=>Liar! He's a liar!
JESUS=>You're a liar! I'm Jesus of Nazareth. I was never crucified. I never came back from the dead. I'm a man like everyone else. Why are you spreading these lies?
ANGEL=>Quiet.
PAUL=>What are you talking about?
JESUS=>I'm the son of Mary and Joseph, who preached in Galilee. James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were my disciples. We marched on Jerusalem, they brought me before Pilate, but God saved me.
PAUL=>No he didn't!
JESUS=>Now I live like a man. I have a family. I eat, work, have children. Do you understand what I'm saying? Don't go around the world spreading these lies about me. Because, I'll tell everyone the truth.
PAUL=>Look around you! Look at these people. Do you see the suffering and unhappiness in this world? Their only hope is the Resurrected Jesus. I don't care whether you're Jesus or not. The Resurrected Jesus will save the world -- that's what matters.
JESUS=>The world can't be saved by lies.
PAUL=>I created the truth. I make it out of longing and faith. I don't struggle to find truth -- I build it. If it's necessary to crucify you to save the world, then I'll crucify you. And I'll resurrect you too, whether you like it or not.
JESUS=>I won't let you. I'll tell everyone the truth.
PAUL=>Shout all you want. Who'll believe you? You started all this, now it can't be stopped. The faithful will grab you and call you a blasphemer and throw you in a fire.
JESUS=>No, that wouldn't happen.
PAUL=>How do you know? You don't know how much people need God. You don't know what a joy it is to hold the cross, to put hope in the hearts of men, to suffer, to be killed -- all for the sake of Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God. Messiah.
PAUL=>Not you. Not for your sake. I'm glad I met you. Now I can forget you. My Jesus is much more powerful.
JESUS=>Don't ever leave me. I'm happy here.
JESUS=>Remember when Mary and I planted these vines -- how many years have we been eating these grapes?
ANGEL=>I don't remember.
JESUS=>In my hands her hair became white... Mary, white... in my hands... she became white.
ANGEL=>You know, this will all have to pass soon.
JESUS=>Why? Are you leaving me?
ANGEL=>Yes. We have to go on. You've grown old. You've done well. We've both done well.
JESUS=>What is it?
MARTHA=>They're burning Jerusalem. The city is destroyed.
MARY=>The Romans are killing everyone.
JESUS=>Let's go inside.
PETER=>Let us through. We're sent by God. He told us you would show yourself to us. He said you were dying.
JESUS=>Is that Peter? I can't tell. That is Peter. What happened to you?
PETER=>The years.
JESUS=>The years? This one I know. No matter how old you get, I know. This is Philip. You were the best of all shepherds, because you had no sheep. They were all in your head.
PHILIP=>Have I changed so little in all this time?
JESUS=>Only for the better, I hope.
JESUS=>And you? They cut out your eye, your ear. Your face... who are you?
JOHN=>Rabbi.
JESUS=>John!
JOHN=>The Romans tortured me and cut away my face. I saw Jerusalem burn. I saw the Ark of the Covenant taken from the temple.
JESUS=>The ark?
PHILIP=>The Temple's destroyed, just as you predicted.
PETER=>There's somebody else. Outside.
PHILIP=>Him you'll know. Be careful, he's still angry.
JESUS=>Judas! Judas, come in. Do you hear me? I've missed you so much.
PETER=>He hears you. He's just not going to say anything.
JOHN=>He's been fighting in Jerusalem. Look at his hands. There's still blood on them.
PHILIP=>Judas...
PETER=>Judas, the Master is speaking to you. Answer him.
JUDAS=>Traitor!
JUDAS=>Traitor. Your place was on the cross. That's where God put you. But when death got too close you ran away, you got scared and ran away and hid yourself in the life of some... man. We did what we were supposed to do. You didn't. You're a coward.
PETER=>Don't you have any respect.
JUDAS=>For him? He was supposed to save man. But all he did is save himself.
JESUS=>No. You just don't understand...
JUDAS=>Understand? Rabbi, you broke my heart. Sometimes I curse the day I ever met you. We held the world in our hands. Remember what you said to me? You took me in your arms, do you remember? And you begged me. "Betray me, betray me. I have to be crucified. I have to be resurrected to save the world."
JUDAS=>"I am the lamb," you said. "Death is the door. Judas, my brother, don't be afraid. Help me go through the door." And I loved you so much I went and betrayed you. But you... you... what are you doing here? What business do you have here? With women, with children... what's good for a man isn't good enough for God. Why weren't you crucified?
PETER=>Look at his wounds, Judas. He's bleeding. You're hurting him, that's enough.
JUDAS=>He was going to be the New Covenant. Now there's no more Israel.
JESUS=>But my Guardian Angel...
JUDAS=>Your Guradian Angel! Look at him!
JUDAS=>Satan.
JUDAS=>If you die this way, you die like a man. If you die like that, you deny God. Your Father. Then there's no sacrifice. Then there's no salvation.
DEATH FIGURE=>I told you we would meet again.
DEATH FIGURE=>There's nothing you can do. You lived this life. You accepted it. It's over now. Just finish it and die like a man.
JESUS=>Abba, father, will you still listen to me? Are you still there? Will you listen to a selfish, unfaithful son? I fought you when you called. I resisted. I thought I knew more. I didn't want to be your son. Can you forgive me? I didn't fight hard enough. I want to take your hand; I want to save my fellow men. Father, take me back. Make a feast. Welcome me home. I want to be your son. I want to pay the price. I want to be crucified and rise again. I want to be the Messiah.
JESUS=>...lama sabachthani!
JESUS=>It is finished.
