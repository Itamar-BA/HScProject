NARRATOR=>A city has many faces --
NARRATOR=>It's one o'clock in the morning now --
NARRATOR=>And this is the face of New York City --
NARRATOR=>-- when it's asleep --
NARRATOR=>-- on a hot summer night --
NARRATOR=>Does money ever sleep, I wonder?
NARRATOR=>Does a machine become tired?
NARRATOR=>Or a song?
NARRATOR=>Does stone ever feel weariness?
MAN'S VOICE=>Some people think it's easy to be a bank teller. Oh brother!
MAN'S VOICE=>I wonder how many stitches in a dress? I'll have to count 'em sometime.
WOMAN'S VOICE=>I wonder how many meals I've cooked in my life? And how many dishes I've washed?
NARRATOR=>A city asleep --
NARRATOR=>-- or as nearly asleep --
NARRATOR=>-- as any city ever is.
NARRATOR=>The pulse of a city like the pulse of a man --
NARRATOR=>-- can be felt in sleep, slow and steady --
NARRATOR=>For some men earn their bread at night.
JOCKEY'S VOICE=>It starts hot and it ends gutty. Let's go.
OPERATOR'S VOICE=>Wonder what the ol' lady made me for lunch tonight? If it's liverwurst again she's got a divorce.
WOMAN'S VOICE=>From where I stand this world's made up of nothin' but dirty feet.
BUM'S VOICE=>Hey, buddy, do they pay you for that or -- -- whoops!
NARRATOR=>And while some people work and most sleep, others are at the close of an evening of relaxation --
NARRATOR=>And still another -- is at the close of her life.
BACKALIS=>Let's go.
GARZA=>Don't be a fool. This has to be sure. Lift her up.
BACKALIS=>Whatcha gonna do?
GARZA=>It's a hot night. We'll give her a bath.
NARRATOR=>A hot night working its way toward dawn. And everything is as usual --
NARRATOR=>Jersey lettuce for New York markets --
NARRATOR=>Tonight's fricassee is somewhat reluctant --
NARRATOR=>Everything as usual --
NARRATOR=>-- and even this, too, can be called routine in a city of eight million people --
BACKALIS=>I done a lot of things but I never killed nobody... Gonna stay drunk for a long time... Don't know what I'm gonna say to God when my time comes. He's got a big heart, I'm told, but He don't like --
GARZA=>I thought you were off the liquor? Liquor is bad. Weakens your character -- fuzzes your brain -- turns you soft. How can a man like me trust a liar like you? I can't!
NARRATOR=>How many things this sky has seen --
NARRATOR=>-- that man has done to man.
NARRATOR=>And now it's morning.
MOTHER'S VOICE=>Some babies are eight o'clock babies. Some babies are seven o'clock babies. Why do you have to be a six o'clock baby?
NARRATOR=>We wake up variously --
NARRATOR=>-- each to his taste.
NARRATOR=>We've washed and we've shaven and it's breakfast time.
OLD MAN'S VOICE=>Milk! Isn't there anything else for ulcers except milk?
MULVEY=>After the ball was over, After the ball was done, da-da-da-da-, da-da- da...
NARRATOR=>And it's time to go to work.
HALLORAN=>Goodbye, Mrs. Halloran.
MRS. HALLORAN=>Goodbye, Mr. Halloran.
HALLORAN=>See you tonight, Mac.
BOY=>So long, bud.
MAN'S VOICE=>Gonna be a scorcher today.
GIRL'S VOICE=>If it's as bad as yesterday, I'll die, I'll be prostrate.
FIRST GIRL'S VOICE=>I went to Jones Beach last night. Had a picnic.
SECOND GIRL'S VOICE=>With the boy friend?
FIRST GIRL'S VOICE=>Yeah.
SECOND GIRL'S VOICE=>Did he get fresh again?
FIRST GIRL'S VOICE=>Yeah.
SECOND GIRL'S VOICE=>Gee -- you was born with a silver spoon.
NARRATOR=>For this woman, the day will not be ordinary --
NARRATOR=>Martha Swenson, forty-two years old, a widow --
NARRATOR=>-- lives a quiet life as a house worker --
MARTHA=>Miss Dexter?
MARTHA=>Help me... Someone help me...
OPERATOR=>Yes, sir. What's your name, please? ...Thank you.
OPERATOR=>One-nine-eight West Six-nine Street. Apartment 4-D.
FIRST PATROLMAN=>Apartment 4-D. Got it.
FIRST PATROLMAN=>20th Precinct. What's out?
SECOND PATROLMAN'S VOICE=>Two-oh-six and one-five-nine.
OPERATOR=>Cars two-oh-six -- and one-five-nine -- Cars two-oh-six -- and one-five-nine -- Proceed to one-nine-eight-West --
DONAHUE=>I don't understand this boy Del Vecchio.
MULVEY=>I do, Sam... I think.
DONAHUE=>Do you make any sense out of what he did?
MULVEY=>No -- but I see eighteen years of feeling lonely and beaten. So he -- exploded.
DONAHUE=>Maybe... Sometimes I wonder what the human heart's made out of.
MULVEY=>My wife, rest her soul, always said she'd rather look into a man's heart than into his head -- that you could tell more about him.
MILLER=>This just came in, Captain. Morning, Lieutenant.
MULVEY=>Morning, Ben.
DONAHUE=>You're free, aren't you, Dan?
MULVEY=>I haven't had a hard day's work since yesterday.
DONAHUE=>Woman drowned in a bathtub. Your assignment.
MULVEY=>Who's to do my leg work?
DONAHUE=>How about young Halloran again?
MULVEY=>All right. I like the boy.
DONAHUE=>How's he doing?
MULVEY=>He's makin' the same mistakes I made at his age.
DONAHUE=>Too bad. I thought he showed promise.
HALLORAN=>-- but that's the point, Ben. In the first six months of a baby's life, the father can't get to know it unless he takes care of it physically. The idea is to do things for the kid -- like bathing it.
MILLER=>But I'm scared to bathe mine. Looks like it'll break.
HALLORAN=>Then learn how to change it. Is it a bottle baby?
MILLER=>Not mine, he's...
MULVEY=>Begging your pardon -- is this the Board of Directors of the Diaper Institute?
HALLORAN=>Hi, Dan.
MULVEY=>We're on a case, you baby experts.
HALLORAN=>What sort of a case? Something hot?
MULVEY=>Dead woman in a bathtub. Something cold.
PATROLMAN=>This way, Lieutenant.
MIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN=>Detectives! You see! I told you it was a murder. I knew!
LITTLE GIRL=>I wanna go to the park. I wanna see the seals.
MIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN=>I have the finest crime library in the world... with pictures.
LITTLE GIRL=>I wanna see the seals.
NURSEMAID=>You saw the seals yesterday. This is a murder. It'll educate you.
MULVEY=>Who's in charge here?
DETECTIVE=>Me, sir -- Detective Sergeant Shaeffer, 20th Precinct.
MULVEY=>What's the story?
SHAEFFER=>The dead woman's name is Jean Dexter. Twenty-six years old, unmarried. She used to be a dress model at Madge Livingston's, on Fifth Avenue. Her parents live in Lakewood, New Jersey. Their name is Batory -- that's Polish. Her name used to be Mary Batory until she came to New York. The ambulance doctor says she died of drowning... that's all I have.
MULVEY=>Got it?
MULVEY'S VOICE=>This her?
SHAEFFER'S VOICE=>Yeah.
SHAEFFER=>Martha Swenson, the woman's housekeeper. She found the body. Mr. Harvey, the house superintendent. He called headquarters.
MULVEY=>Where's the body?
SHAEFFER=>In there.
MULVEY=>Didn't this woman drown in a bathtub, doctor?
DOCTOR=>She was on the bed when I got here.
MULVEY=>Who moved the body?
MARTHA=>When I came in and... saw her like that in the tub... I called Mr. Harvey, here. He -- helped me.
MULVEY=>You should've waited for the police! Both of you should have known better.
MARTHA=>I was so upset...
HALLORAN=>There's a bottle of pills under the bed, Dan. Looks like sleeping pills.
MULVEY=>Let me see 'em.
HALLORAN=>I left 'em there.
MULVEY=>Why, thank you for that, Jimmy. This is moving day around here. I thought maybe you caught the fever.
HALLORAN=>About those pills... maybe the dame took an overdose?
MULVEY=>Jimmy, it's our obligation to wait for the medical examiner. He's a learned physician employed by the city to determine the causes of mysterious deaths. Let the good man earn his money.
DR. HOFFMAN=>No accident and no suicide. There are bruises on her throat, shoulders and arms. Those slight burns around her mouth and nose were caused by chloroform. She was chloroformed after a struggle, then dumped into the tub alive.
HALLORAN=>How can you tell that, Doctor?
HOFFMAN=>By the white foam around her mouth. It's proof she drowned. New?
MULVEY=>New.
PHOTOGRAPHER=>Okay, Lieutenant?
MULVEY=>Okay, Doctor?
DR. HOFFMAN=>The body's yours.
MULVEY=>Start working, gentlemen.
HALLORAN=>Dan... these were in the laundry hamper. No laundry marks and no label.
MULVEY=>Real fancy. You don't get these for three ninety-five. Pick up these pajamas on your way out, Nick. I want 'em under your X- ray machine.
NICK=>Right.
MULVEY=>Who belongs to these?
MARTHA=>I -- I don't know, sir. I'm so unstrung.
MULVEY=>I know you are. But I think you'd like to help us.
MARTHA=>I would -- I would. Such a sweet girl, she was. A little wild, by my standards maybe, but live and let live, I say. Always treated me swell.
MULVEY=>The pajamas, Martha.
MARTHA=>I'm all in pieces. I...
MARTHA=>They could belong to Mr. Henderson. This is awful. I might be getting someone in trouble.
MULVEY=>We don't want to get the wrong person in trouble either... What's his first name?
MARTHA=>Philip, I think. He lives in Baltimore. That's what she told me. I only saw him once or twice. I only know he was an admirer of Miss Dexter's.
MULVEY=>Seems likely.
MARTHA=>Oh, I'm all in little pieces. What a nightmare!
MULVEY=>You're being a big help to us, Martha... How old would you say Mr. Henderson is?
MARTHA=>Oh... fifty about.
MULVEY=>What does he look like?
MARTHA=>Oh -- he's real distinguished, real. About as tall as him. Got grey hair. And strong-looking for his age. No corporation on him, if you know what I mean.
MULVEY=>Uh-huh. Got it? Do you know Henderson?
HARVEY=>Never saw him.
MULVEY=>Shoot a wire on this to Baltimore.
HOFFMAN=>Here's the ring she was wearing. I'll phone you after the autopsy... Have fun.
MULVEY=>Likewise.
MARTHA=>Sir... that ring... it's a black star sapphire... very rare. She said her brother sent it from India.
MULVEY=>Did she have any other jewelry?
MARTHA=>Oh -- a lot. Valuable. She kept it in a jewel box, locked.
MULVEY=>Let's go get it. Please.
PHOTOGRAPHER=>Okay... You can pick up that bottle under the bed now.
NICK=>Check.
MULVEY=>Nick -- can we open a drawer in that table?
NICK=>Yeah. I've gone over them.
MARTHA=>What are you doing to the furniture?
NICK=>Investigating it.
MULVEY=>Come on, Martha.
MARTHA=>She had bracelets and rings... diamond rings... They're all gone. It must have been thieves that killed her.
MULVEY=>Another detective. Could you describe the jewelry?
MARTHA=>Most of it, I think.
MULVEY=>Fine. Go in and rest yourself now.
NICK=>Looks like Seconal.
MULVEY=>Jimmy -- I want to start questioning those two in there. You start your leg work. Get the number of this prescription, see the druggist. From him go to the doctor. Then go to the dress shop she worked at.
HALLORAN=>Right.
POLICEMAN=>Lieutenant -- the newspaper men are here.
MULVEY=>Okay, I'm coming. Getting any fingerprints, Nick?
NICK=>Nothing good so far. Half prints, quarter prints -- that's all.
MULVEY=>Looks to me like a heavy case -- a heavy case.
NARRATOR=>An investigation for murder is under way now in the city of New York. It will advance methodically, by trial and error, by leg and brain work, by asking a thousand questions to get one answer. Ever look for a needle in a dark house? You can find it -- if you're patient enough. Just get down on your knees, examine every inch of every floor of every room -- and you'll find it. The Homicide Squad, my friends, is made up of patient men. Ever work a jigsaw puzzle? Ever try to find a murderer? Ever play button-button?
DRUGGIST=>Dr. Lawrence Stoneman -- office in the Squibb Building. Confidentially -- a doctor in the dough -- high class.
HALLORAN=>Do you happen to remember Miss Dexter?
DRUGGIST=>A one-shot customer.
HALLORAN=>Not even by the fact you made up sleeping pills for her?
DRUGGIST=>Confidentially, half the people in this city can't sleep without pills. Hurry up... hurry up... too much hurry up.
HALLORAN=>Thanks. You've been a help.
NARRATOR=>Ask a question, get an answer, write it down...
MULVEY=>Did she have any other men friends?
MARTHA=>None I know of, sir. Just this Niles man. Robert Niles -- a lovely man.
MULVEY=>How are you doing, Nick?
NICK=>Not too bad. Found two grey hairs on the rug.
MULVEY=>Grey, eh?... How about fingerprints?
NICK=>No good ones yet.
MULVEY=>Don't you mind me. Just admirin' your hair.
NARRATOR=>Ask a question and take a walk. Hop a bus and ask a question. Jimmy Halloran's an expert with his feet. He pounded a beat in the Bronx for a year as a cop... during the war he walked halfway across Europe with a rifle in his hand. Ever play button- button in a city of eight million people --
HALLORAN=>Is Dr. Stoneman in?
NURSE=>Do you have an appointment?
HALLORAN=>I'm from the Police Department. It's quite important.
NURSE=>Just a moment.
NARRATOR=>There's the layout, Jim. The man who killed Jean Dexter is somewhere down there. Can't blame him for hiding, can you?
NURSE'S VOICE=>Dr. Stoneman'll see you.
DR. STONEMAN=>Yes sir. What can I do for you? Have a seat.
HALLORAN=>I want to ask you about a patient of yours -- Jean Dexter.
DR. STONEMAN=>Dexter? Are you sure she's my patient?
HALLORAN=>You wrote a prescription for her two weeks ago -- Seconal.
STONEMAN=>Yes, a blonde girl. Very handsome, I remember now... Dexter. What department are you from, Officer?
HALLORAN=>Homicide.
STONEMAN=>Oh? Don't tell me that girl murdered someone?
HALLORAN=>Someone murdered her.
STONEMAN=>What? My goodness... when...
HALLORAN=>Last night sometime.
STONEMAN=>What do you want to know?
HALLORAN=>Whatever you can tell me about her.
STONEMAN=>She needed a good spanking. Took Benzedrine by day, needed sleeping pills at night. I told her to slow up -- but no. Life was too short for her. Burned out now. All her fresh, young beauty on a scrap heap. Excuse me, Officer, but I'm a doctor because I'm interested in people. I hate to see human beings waste themselves.
HALLORAN=>Can you tell me anything else about her? Her life -- her friends?
STONEMAN=>No. Nothing. I only saw her that one visit.
HALLORAN=>I guess that's all, Doctor. Thank you.
FIRST GIRL=>Imagine me in that!
SECOND GIRL=>I can't imagine.
FIRST GIRL=>In the Sert Room of the Waldorf Astoria. With Frankie singing.
SECOND GIRL=>I can't imagine.
FIRST GIRL=>Gosh, I'd commit murder for a dress like that. It's a pome by Shakespeare, that's what it is. Lookit that feller. What do you suppose he's buying?
SECOND GIRL'S VOICE=>I can't imagine.
FIRST GIRL'S VOICE=>Oh, you -- you're so uncooperative I could slam you.
MRS. LIVINGSTON=>...and somewhere in the back of her pretty head there was a fixed notion that she couldn't be happy without being rich. I don't think Jean ever would have married unless the man had money -- real money.
HALLORAN=>Why did you fire her?
MRS. LIVINGSTON=>Gentlemen sometimes come here with their wives. When Jean Dexter modeled, many of them left my shop a little too interested in her. Their wives didn't like it -- and neither did I.
HALLORAN=>I see. Can I talk to her friend now -- the model you spoke about?
MRS. LIVINGSTON=>Ruth Young? Yes. I'll call her.
FIRST GIRL=>You see -- he's gonna buy something. Oh, I can't bear it.
SECOND GIRL=>It's getting late. We better go.
FIRST GIRL=>So what if we're late?
SECOND GIRL=>The boss'll holler.
FIRST GIRL=>Let him holler. Strengthen his lungs. Oh, lookit.
FIRST GIRL=>Oh, I can't bear it. Oh, I'm going. What a dress. It's a pome.
SECOND GIRL=>A pome. By you everything's a pome.
FIRST GIRL=>Oh, Millie -- you got no imagination.
HALLORAN=>Miss Young -- I understand you modeled with Jean Dexter?
RUTH=>We're friends, too. Is she in trouble, Mr. Halloran?
HALLORAN=>Well... She is kind of wild, isn't she?
RUTH=>Oh, no... Maybe Mrs. Livingston would call her wild, but I wouldn't. She's full of fun... wonderful company.
HALLORAN=>Do you know anybody who has cause to dislike her?
RUTH=>No...
HALLORAN=>How about Mrs. Henderson?
RUTH=>Who's she?
HALLORAN=>Well, Miss Dexter and Mr. Henderson are very friendly, aren't they?
RUTH=>She never told me about a man named Henderson.
HALLORAN=>Are you sure?
RUTH=>Really, Mr. Halloran -- Jean's my friend -- I don't think I want to answer any more questions unless you tell me why you're asking them.
HALLORAN=>She was found dead this morning.
HALLORAN=>Sit down... Rest a moment. I'm sorry.
NARRATOR=>Learn anything, Halloran? How does it add up? Button, button, where's the button?
BOY=>I'm a whale. Lookit... Lookit me... I'm a whale.
BOY=>I'll moider you. I'll cut your head off.
FIREMAN=>Such language.
NILES=>In front of a police station, too.
MILLER=>The janitor's story of his whereabouts last night is being checked. Ditto the maid. No report yet on fingerprints. Constentino is on his way to Lakewood to see the girl's parents.
PERELLI=>Got Robert Niles, Lieutenant.
MULVEY=>Have him in.
MULVEY=>Thank you for coming down, Mr. Niles. I'm Lieutenant Mulvey. Make yourself comfortable. This is Sergeant Miller.
NILES=>How do you do... I've never been in a police station. Why'd you want to see me, Lieutenant?
MULVEY=>Just a routine check on something. Did you ever run across a girl named... ...Dexter?
NILES=>Jean Dexter? Why, yes... we're good friends.
MULVEY=>How long have you known her?
NILES=>A little over a year. She helps me out in my business occasionally. She's a model.
MULVEY=>What business is that?
NILES=>Merchandising consultant. I help out-of-town buyers get woolens, dress goods... Anything in the textile line.
MULVEY=>Do you pay Miss Dexter a salary?
NILES=>No... just a... bonus from time to time when she does something.
MULVEY=>Like what?
NILES=>Modeling... entertaining somebody for me.
MULVEY=>When did you see her last?
NILES=>Yesterday. We had lunch together. Why?
MULVEY=>You haven't seen her since?
NILES=>No. Is anything the matter?
MULVEY=>She's dead. Murdered.
HALLORAN=>Mulvey back yet?
FOWLER=>Inside. Talking to a guy.
HALLORAN=>Dan? Jimmy. Got a girl here -- Ruth Young. Friend of Dexter's. Model at Livingston's.
MULVEY=>Hold it. I'll buzz.
NILES=>This is terrible. I feel sick over it.
NILES=>My hands haven't trembled like this since I was in the South Pacific.
MULVEY=>What happened to you there?
NILES=>Oh... my first time in combat...
MULVEY=>What outfit were you in?
NILES=>Seventy-seventh...
MULVEY'S VOICE=>I think I had a cousin in that one. It's a New York division, isn't it?
NILES'S VOICE=>Yes.
MULVEY=>Corporal James Dennis...
NILES=>Don't remember him. I was a Captain.
MULVEY=>We want to find the person who murdered Jean Dexter, Mr. Niles.
NILES=>Anything I can tell you!
MULVEY=>Anyone you know who might've had a reason to kill her?
NILES=>Everyone liked Jean.
MULVEY=>Do you happen to know a friend of Miss Dexter's called Ruth Young?
NILES=>Ruth Young? No, I... Oh, yes... a model, isn't she?
MULVEY=>I think so. How well do you know her?
NILES=>I've met her once or twice at parties Jean gave.
MULVEY=>And how long did you know Miss Dexter?
NILES=>About a year.
MULVEY=>See her often?
NILES=>Why, yes, I...
RUTH=>Robert, why are you here?
NILES=>Why, hello, Ruth.
RUTH=>You don't think he could've been involved in Jean's death? He hardly knew her.
MULVEY=>How do you know?
RUTH=>Well, of course I know! Robert and I are engaged.
MULVEY=>Congratulations.
NARRATOR=>The items that make up this murder are being compiled now...
NARRATOR=>They'll be listed in a folder marked Dexter, Jean... along with some questions...
NARRATOR=>Is Henderson the murderer? Did a taxicab take him to the Pennsylvania Railroad Station?
NARRATOR=>Who is Henderson? Where does he live? Who knows him?
PERELLI=>Do you know Niles?
JANITOR=>Sure. I keep tabs on everybody. I'm sharp.
PERELLI=>What kind of a business does he run?
JANITOR=>He don't run any.
PERELLI=>How do you know?
JANITOR=>I'm sharp. Nobody comes to see him. No secretary. Nothing to clean out of his waste basket. Don't spend much time here himself. He's a bust.
JANITOR=>See... told you I was sharp.
MULVEY=>I might be wanting to see you again.
RUTH=>Any time you say. Jean was my friend.
MULVEY=>You won't leave town without letting me know?
RUTH=>Oh? All right... Good-bye.
MULVEY=>'Bye. Lovely girl, isn't she? Lovely.
FOWLER=>Yeah!
MULVEY=>Lovely long legs.
FOWLER=>Yeah -- yeah.
MULVEY=>Keep looking at 'em.
FOWLER=>A pleasure.
MILLER=>Thanks.
MILLER=>Couple of things. One: Medical examiner called in. Dexter died between one and two A.M.
MULVEY=>I see.
MILLER=>And here are a few interesting items on our friend inside.
MULVEY=>Mr. Niles...
NILES=>These things happen, Lieutenant. I told you I didn't know Ruth Young very well. Now you know we're engaged. Can't blame a man for wanting to keep his fianc�e out of a murder case, can you?
MULVEY=>I never had a fianc�e in a murder case. And just between ourselves... you never told your fianc�e what good friends you and Miss Dexter were -- did you?
NILES=>Ruth's a bit jealous, Lieutenant. You understand...
MULVEY=>Uh huh... I wonder now... is there anything else you told me that isn't... strictly true?
NILES=>I have no reason to lie to you, Lieutenant.
MULVEY=>I've got a report in front of me says you never were in the South Pacific, Mr. Niles. You weren't in the 77th Division. You weren't an officer. You weren't in the Army.
NILES=>I suppose you think I'm a heel... I didn't even wait for the draft. I tried to enlist. They wouldn't take me. I've got a trick knee from college football. I just couldn't get in.
MULVEY=>That's all right with me... but why lie about it?
NILES=>I don't know. Stupid pride, I suppose.
MULVEY=>How did you spend the war years, Mr. Niles?
NILES=>I was in Chicago. Same business I have now.
MULVEY=>Been at it long?
NILES=>Six or seven years. Since college.
MULVEY=>Doing pretty well?
NILES=>Very good these days.
MULVEY=>Is Perelli back? Send him in.
MULVEY=>What can you tell us about Mr. Niles's business?
PERELLI=>He ain't got a business. It's a dodge. No credit rating. Dropped from his university club for nonpayment of dues. Still owes a food and liquor bill of $110.83.
MULVEY=>I've been thirty-eight years on the force, Mr. Niles. I've been a cop on the beat, I've been with the Safe and Loft Squad, I've been twenty-two years in the Homicide Division. But in a lifetime of interrogatin' an' investigation', you are probably the biggest an' most willing liar I ever met.
NILES=>All right, I'm a liar. I'm a circus character altogether. But I didn't kill Jean Dexter. I told you where I was last night. Why don't you check on that?
MULVEY=>We're doing that right now.
NILES=>Okay then. That's fine. I'm sorry. I'm not angry at you, Lieutenant. You're just doing your job. The truth is I'm ashamed of myself. My family used to have money and position. Since I got out of college, I haven't been much of a success. I'm trying to keep up a front... But I'm only a small-time liar, Lieutenant. Believe me. On important things I'm straight as a die.
MULVEY=>Every man to his taste.
NILES=>Ask me anything you want. Jean was my friend. I want to help you.
MULVEY=>You spent close to fifty dollars last night at the Trinidad Club. Where'd you get the money?
NILES=>I play a sharp game of bridge with Park Avenue friends. I take a flier on the stock market. On inside tips. When I'm hard up, I borrow money... That's the truth.
MULVEY=>Thank you... Now about this man Henderson. You say you only met him once in Miss Dexter's apartment. Would you describe him to me?
NILES=>Well... medium height; husky; blonde hair; wore glasses... looked to be about thirty-five...
MULVEY=>Uh... huh...
MULVEY=>Lieutenant Mulvey... Yes... Yes... Oh... All right. Well, Mr. Niles, after telling me a lot of stories about a lot of things, you apparently told me an accurate story of where you were last night. Four witnesses put you at the Trinidad Club at the time Jean Dexter died. I guess you're in the clear, Mr. Niles.
NILES=>I told you I never lie about important things... Any more questions?
MULVEY=>I guess not.
NILES=>You know -- I'm not as much of a heel as I sound. I'm trying to catch on to a good job in industry. One of these days I will.
MULVEY=>I wish you the best.
NILES=>Good-bye, then.
MULVEY=>Good luck.
MULVEY=>Keep two men on him in three shifts.
MULVEY=>I don't want a thing said to the newspapers about Niles. He's not even in this case.
MULVEY=>Spent fifty dollars last night, he said. On that much a week I supported a wife and raised two kids.
HALLORAN=>Sure, but you were brought up on the wrong side of the tracks.
MARTHA SWENSON NED HARVEY RUTH YOUNG ROBERT NILES=>PHILIP HENDERSON
MILLER=>The only good fingerprints we got were of the maid and Jean Dexter... The Baltimore police say they can't locate anyone so far who answers Henderson's description... The pajamas in Dexter's apartment show nothing under the X-ray. They're an English import and never been washed. All stores that carry the line are being checked. That's it, Captain.
DONAHUE=>Very little to go on. This man Niles... how's his alibi for last night?
MULVEY=>He seems in the clear. So does everybody else we've connected with so far.
HALLORAN=>So Henderson's our only suspect...
MULVEY=>How about this man?
HALLORAN=>Who's he?
DONAHUE=>McGillicuddy is Dan's name for any unknown party in a case.
HALLORAN=>You mean two men did the murder?
MULVEY=>Maybe there were five. All I know is there was more than one.
HALLORAN=>How do you know?
MULVEY=>This is a bed... For a moment, I'm an attractive little lady. How would you chloroform me, Mr. Henderson?
HALLORAN=>I guess the best way'd be if I stood behind you.
MULVEY=>Correct -- that's the way one man would do it.
MULVEY=>We just got the photographs. They show finger marks on both arms.
MULVEY'S VOICE=>That means a man stood behind her and held her arms with both hands, while Henderson or someone else chloroformed her. A strong man, with thick, strong fingers.
MULVEY=>And that man was my old, old friend, Joseph P. McGillicuddy.
DONAHUE=>You're right, Dan.
HALLORAN=>Now we have to find two men.
DONAHUE=>You have to find them. I'm busy on half a dozen other cases. Good night, gentlemen.
ALL=>Good night.
MILLER=>Need me any more?
MULVEY=>A heavy case... Why is Niles such a liar? What's in his heart? Is he just a blowhard or...? A heavy case...
MILLER=>Say... there's an old dame outside says she can crack the Dexter case.
OLD LADY=>Are you the officer in charge of the bathtub murder?
MULVEY=>Yes, M'am.
OLD LADY=>This one?
MULVEY'S VOICE=>Yes, M'am.
OLD LADY=>I can help you solve it.
MULVEY=>Yes?
OLD LADY=>My gran'daddy is Sheriff of Tuckahue County, Mississippi. He's...
HALLORAN=>Your gran'daddy?
OLD LADY=>Yes... I'm only in my twenties, you know.
MULVEY=>And very handsome you are, too.
OLD LADY=>Yes, I know. So many men are crazy about me, I don't know what to do. 'Bye now. Oh yes -- about the murder. I almost forgot. We'll have to get a front tooth from a hound dog.
MULVEY=>Yes, M'am.
OLD LADY=>Bury it fifty feet from the grave. On the third day after the first full moon, the murderer will confess.
MULVEY=>Thank you, M'am.
OLD LADY=>Prices are awfully high these days, aren't they?
MULVEY=>Yes, M'am.
OLD LADY=>I had to decide whether to spend a nickel on an apple for my supper -- or spend it on the subway to come up here.
MULVEY=>Please.
OLD LADY=>You're sweet. I'll put you down in my diary tonight. 'Bye now.
MULVEY=>'Bye.
HALLORAN=>How much of that have you had in thirty-eight years?
MULVEY=>I couldn't count it. Every time there's a headline case. We'll be lucky if there isn't a lot more.
HALLORAN=>'Bye now.
MULVEY=>'Bye.
NARRATOR=>The day's work is over now...
NARRATOR=>...and several million people...
NARRATOR=>...are on their way home...
NARRATOR=>...tired and hot...
NARRATOR=>Six A.M. tomorrow will come awfully soon.
NARRATOR=>Must've been a hard day behind that counter, honey...
NARRATOR=>...but don't bite your nails. Harry won't like it. And besides, this isn't how the murder was really committed.
STOUT GIRL=>Read about that bathtub murder?
YOUNG MAN=>I'll say. Some figger that dame had. I wouldna minded being the wash rag in her bathtub. Haw! Haw!
NEWSBOY=>Evening paper... Sensational... Tibet Report... Bathtub murder... Hitler reported hiding in... Artist's Model... Get your paper...
HALLORAN=>Anybody home?
JANEY'S VOICE=>Hello, honey.
JANEY=>Bet it was hot in Manhattan today.
HALLORAN=>I was too busy to be hot. On a new case. The subway was a furnace, though.
JANEY=>You too warm to say hello?
HALLORAN=>Yup.
JANEY=>Got you a nice, cool supper. Jellied tongue.
HALLORAN=>Swell. I'm hungry. Stop holding on to me. Let's go, I'm starved.
HALLORAN=>Where's Billy?
JANEY=>I put him to bed. Listen, dear, I'm sorry to tell you but you've got a nasty job to do before supper.
JANEY=>Billy has to have a whipping.
HALLORAN=>Why?
JANEY=>He walked right out of the yard, crossed Stillman Avenue all by himself and went to the park.
HALLORAN=>Well... I'll give him a real talking to.
JANEY=>No you won't, you'll give him a real whipping, with a strap.
HALLORAN=>Just a minute, honey...
JANEY=>I know -- I know -- you don't believe in whipping a child. Neither have I until now. But do you want Billy run over by a truck?
JANEY=>I've reasoned with him, I've pleaded with him, I've threatened him. But the minute my back is turned, he's off.
HALLORAN=>Well... he's a spunky kid, Janey.
JANEY=>I don't want him to be a dead kid.
HALLORAN=>No...
JANEY=>Go ahead then. Get it over with.
HALLORAN=>Yeah, I guess I will... right after supper.
JANEY=>Jimmy --
HALLORAN=>I can't just go in there and take a strap to that boy. I've got to work up to it a little bit.
JANEY=>You'd think I was asking you to kill him.
HALLORAN=>If you think it's so easy, you whip him.
JANEY=>Me? That's not a woman's job.
HALLORAN=>Why does it have to be a man's job?
JANEY=>It's always the man's job.
HALLORAN=>Who says so? ...Hello. Oh... sure, Dan... yeah, right away.
HALLORAN=>Got a call. I have to meet Mulvey right away.
JANEY=>Without any supper?
HALLORAN=>Save it for me... I'll grab a hamburger meanwhile.
JANEY=>I wish you were an ice cream salesman or something. I don't like this night work and I don't like it every time you strap on that gun.
HALLORAN=>If I were an ice cream salesman, I'd get fat. Then you wouldn't like me.
JANEY=>I don't like you now.
HALLORAN=>Oh, yes you do.
JANEY=>Remember -- you've got a job before you leave this house.
HALLORAN=>What?
JANEY=>Billy.
HALLORAN=>I can't stop for that now.
JANEY=>Halloran -- you're a coward.
HALLORAN=>'Bye now.
JANEY=>Jimmy.
JANEY=>I'll wait up for you.
HALLORAN=>Good deal.
JANEY=>Where you going?
HALLORAN=>To see a pretty girl.
JANEY=>Some place exciting, huh?
HALLORAN=>Yes, dear. To the morgue.
CONSTENTINO=>This is Lieutenant Mulvey. Mr. and Mrs. Batory, the girl's parents.
MRS. BATORY=>I told her! I knew she'd turn out no good. All these young girls... so crazy to be with the bright lights. There's no bright lights for her now, is there?
MULVEY=>She's at rest now, Mrs. Batory.
MRS. BATORY=>No -- her kind of dead don't rest! And how 'bout us? The scandal -- God in Heaven! My husband's a gardener. He works for a banker, a highly respectable gentleman. He'll get fired now. Oh, I hate her, I hate her.
MR. BATORY=>Paula...
MRS. BATORY=>Never mind... I hate her. I say it out straight. So fancy she was. Even had to change her name. Hah!
MULVEY=>We'd better go in now. If you'll please follow the nurse.
MRS. BATORY=>I do hate her, I do. I warned her. A million times I warned her.
MRS. BATORY=>I hate her. I hate her for what she done to us.
MULVEY=>Please tell me if she's your daughter.
MR. BATORY=>That's her...
MRS. BATORY=>My baby! Oh, my baby!
MRS. BATORY=>I feel better now. The walk was good for me.
MULVEY=>Are you sure you want to go home tonight? We can get you a hotel room.
MR. BATORY=>We'll go home. We don't like this place... ...this fine city.
MRS. BATORY=>You don't know... who done it, huh?
MULVEY=>Not yet.
MULVEY=>Did you ever see this?
MULVEY=>Your daughter told someone it came from her brother, in India.
MR. BATORY=>We only had her -- no other kids -- no boy.
MULVEY=>I see... And did your daughter ever mention a man named Henderson?
MRS. BATORY=>We don't know any Henderson. We haven't seen Mary even for six months. She was too busy to come see us. Who knows what she ran around with?
MR. BATORY=>She's dead, momma, don't... A good girl, I swear it! It's my fault maybe I didn't do better for her. When she was fifteen she was working already, the five and ten cent store. Oh it was hard, depression time, hard.
MRS. BATORY=>So what? She's the only one didn't have it easy? Other people had it worse! Was that a reason to leave home -- to change your name? Wanting too much, that's why she went wrong. Bright lights and theaters and furs and night clubs. That's why she's dead now. Dear God, why wasn't she born ugly? What a heartache! You nurse a child, raise it, pet it, love it... and it ends like this.
MULVEY=>I've had my own children, Mrs. Batory. They turned out all right, thank goodness, but who's to know why or how? I've seen a lot of human misery in my work. I don't know where people start to go wrong.
MRS. BATORY=>We did our best. It wasn't our fault.
MULVEY=>Of course it wasn't. And maybe not even hers. When you think it over, I guess it was everybody's fault. People get so pounded and pounded in this life. It's a jungle, a city like this. Eight million people struggling for life, for food, for air, for a bit of happiness. Seems like there ain't enough of everything to go around... and so sometimes it breaks out in... violence.
MULVEY=>...an' we call it homicide...
NARRATOR=>Six A.M. -- Summer day -- work day.
NARRATOR=>This time yesterday, Jean Dexter was just another name in the phone book...
NARRATOR=>...but now she's the marmalade on ten thousand pieces of toast... all around the town...
MULVEY=>East Side, West Side, all around the town...
DRUGGIST=>So I says to that detective: 'Confidentially,' I says, 'that Dexter girl used to come in here night after night and pour her heart out to me -- ask my advice.' That'll be twenty- five cents, please. And I told her 'marry and settle down, have a couple kids,' I said! But it's too late now. Keep it confidential, bud, willya?
MRS. STONEMAN=>Lawrence!!
STONEMAN=>Uh-huh?
MRS. STONEMAN=>This Dexter murder case! It says she was your patient.
STONEMAN=>Not really. I only saw her once.
MRS. STONEMAN=>She was beautiful, wasn't she?
STONEMAN=>Quite.
MRS. STONEMAN=>What was she like?
STONEMAN=>Just one of those sad creatures who want more than life can give them. Coffee?
PUBLISHER=>This Dexter case. Give it an editorial today. 'What's the matter with the police? What's the matter with the Mayor?' Slam into 'em. Pin their ears back.
MANAGING EDITOR=>How about saying the whole city's in the grip of a crime wave?
PUBLISHER=>Listen -- as long as this administration's in office, we're suffering from a perpetual crime wave.
MANAGING EDITOR=>Check.
MANAGING EDITOR=>How do you want me to handle the Dexter case editorially?
PUBLISHER=>You know our policy. Watch how the Tabloid handles it. You do the opposite.
MANAGING EDITOR=>Check.
FIRST MAN'S VOICE=>Hey, Mac -- what's doin', why all the people here?
SECOND MAN'S VOICE=>What's doin? Whatsamatter, you live in Canarsie or somethin'? This is the dump where that model was killed.
FIRST MAN'S VOICE=>You don't mean it! The bathtub girl, eh? So why didn't she take showers?
THE MAYOR=>That's all for this morning, gentlemen. Any questions?
A REPORTER=>Since Commissioner Wallander's here, do you have any statement on the Jean Dexter case?
THE MAYOR=>I don't. Do you, Commissioner?
COMMISSIONER WALLANDER=>A case is a case. If it happens to lend itself to sensationalism, that's your good luck. But to the Homicide Squad, it's just another job.
THE MAYOR=>I'll tell you this: As Mayor of New York I expect criticism -- not only of me but of the Police Department. But as an ex-cop, I know a tough case when I see one. Not many murders go unsolved -- but it takes more than twenty-four hours to handle a case like this.
COMMISSIONER WALLANDER=>For that -- thanks.
THE MAYOR=>Don't mention it.
NARRATOR=>The sun isn't too hot as yet. And it's pleasant to walk along Madison Ave...
NARRATOR=>...there are shady doorways to rest in... for patient men who are not in a hurry.
NARRATOR=>It's pleasant on an early summer morning to listen to an old song...
NARRATOR=>...it whiles away the time.
NARRATOR=>...So pleasant to dive into the East River even though sometimes the water is littered with a city's trash: a half-eaten apple... a chip of wood... a lady's hat...
BOY=>Look! Hey, look!
NARRATOR=>...a chip of wood... a lady's hat... and other things...
MULVEY=>This is Dexter's address book. Contact every name listed in it. Keep asking if they heard her talk about Henderson.
MULVEY=>Start in on this ring of Dexter's. Canvass every expensive jewelry shop in the city... maybe Henderson bought it for her.
HALLORAN=>Oh, my poor feet.
MULVEY=>Be glad you're not a horseback cop.
MULVEY=>What's with you?
PERELLI=>Niles sold this about an hour ago to a jeweler on Madison Avenue. Got six hundred dollars for it.
MULVEY=>Well! Where's the list of stuff that was stolen from Dexter?
MULVEY=>It isn't on here. It's a man's item anyway.
MULVEY=>That's an interesting man, that Niles. He operates very strange.
PERELLI=>Say -- how about I check this cigarette case with the Department list of all jewelry stolen in the last year or so?
MULVEY=>All right... I don't think you'll get anything, though. He'd be crazy to pawn a stolen item in the middle of a hot case like this.
PERELLI=>Maybe he is crazy.
MULVEY=>Not that one.
NARRATOR=>Button, button, who's got the button?
NARRATOR=>Relax, Constentino, your wife does this, too.
NARRATOR=>...How about a permanent, bud? How about a mud-pack for your complexion? Ever have your eyebrows plucked? What? Don't you even get your nails manicured? Hey, Constentino, wait! You could get to like it here.
JEWELER=>No, I never saw this ring. It's an odd one. Hard to forget.
HALLORAN=>Thanks. You've been a help.
NARRATOR=>How are the feet, Halloran? Would you care for some arch supporters? Would you be interested in knowing that there was a confession in this case only ten minutes ago?
NARRATOR=>What's your hurry, Mulvey? You're supposed to be a patient man. Why get so excited?
NARRATOR=>Calling all members of the Homicide Squad, Officer. There was a confession in the Dexter case at 11:50 A.M.
NARRATOR=>Hey, Constentino -- why don't you throw that address book away? This case is all washed up -- it's finished -- got a confession --
POLICEMAN=>Here he is, Lieutenant. I caught him trying to get in the kitchen by the back door. He's a grocery boy in the neighborhood.
BISBEE=>Yes, I did it -- I killed her. I want to be punished. I'm guilty. My hands are stained with her blood.
MULVEY=>Why did you kill her?
BISBEE=>She deserved it. For months I've been watching her. I'd come up with packages and there she'd be -- in her negligee -- beautiful -- but no soul -- immoral. So I did it. I rid the world of her.
MULVEY=>The knife you stabbed her with. What did you do with it?
BISBEE=>You'll never find it -- never. I buried it -- I buried it.
MULVEY=>Call Bellevue Hospital... Psychiatric Department.
NARRATOR=>It's seven-thirty in the evening now. It's been a great day on the Dexter case: Developments -- none; new clues -- none; progress -- none. Ever try to catch a murderer? It has its depressing moments.
DONAHUE=>I can't see you've missed anything.
MULVEY=>Boss, I can always trust you to comfort a man.
DONAHUE=>Any word today from Baltimore?
MULVEY=>No... and Henderson's pajamas were bought last week in a store on 34th Street -- but not by Henderson -- by Jean Dexter.
DONAHUE=>A heavy case...
MULVEY=>It's that.
PERELLI=>This cigarette case Niles sold this morning -- it's hot. It was stolen from Dr. Lawrence Stoneman.
DONAHUE=>Dexter's physician?
PERELLI=>Yeah. He reported a robbery in his apartment in March. Twenty-eight hundred dollars worth of stuff. None of it has ever shown up... Here's the Department list of stolen jewelry for the past year.
PERELLI=>That's not all -- Niles bought a plane ticket for Mexico City -- one way.
MULVEY=>Leaving when?
PERELLI=>Tomorrow noon... Want me to pick him up?
MULVEY=>No. What else did he do today?
PERELLI=>...Had lunch with Ruth Young. They held hands for an hour. She went back to her shop -- he went to the Park Central and had a swim. He's at Toots Shor's now.
DONAHUE=>Buying a plane ticket -- pawning a stolen cigarette case -- that's not smart. What is this man -- an amachoor or something?
MULVEY=>That's what's in his heart! Now I know! He's had no experience at being a crook. He's a scared college boy way out in deep water. He's starting to thrash around now, he's in a panic.
DONAHUE=>A panic over what?
MULVEY=>I don't know, yet, Sam.
DONAHUE=>And how does this Stoneman figure? Why should Niles pawn a cigarette case belonging to him?
HALLORAN=>Dan -- I got something, maybe.
MULVEY=>About what?
HALLORAN=>The black star sapphire Dexter was wearing when she was killed -- it didn't belong to her. She didn't buy it, Henderson didn't buy it for her. It belongs to a Mrs. Hylton, 482 Park Ave. I found a jeweler who repaired it for her.
DONAHUE=>We started in a murder case and we're up to our necks in stolen jewelry.
PERELLI=>Mrs. Edgar Hylton -- there it is.
MULVEY=>Black star sapphire -- part of a sixty-two-hundred-dollar robbery of her apartment. Did you see this Mrs. Hylton?
HALLORAN=>I thought you might want to see her.
MULVEY=>Now that was considerate of you, Jimmy. We'll telephone the lady and we'll both go to see her.
MULVEY=>Have a beer on me, Sam. An' throw a pinch of salt over your shoulder. This case is starting to move.
NARRATOR=>Ever watch a hound dog tracking A police sedan stops at the curb. Mulvey and Halloran get out, walk toward entrance. down a rabbit? It sniffs -- and sniffs -- and suddenly it begins to run...
MAID=>Mrs. Hylton's waiting for you.
MAID=>Lieutenant Mulvey, M'am.
MRS. HYLTON=>As you see, I'm crazy about rhumba music. Imagine, at my age! My, what a nice-looking young man! You're the Lieutenant who telephoned me, aren't you? Did you get my jewels back?
MULVEY=>Is this one of 'em?
MRS. HYLTON=>Yes it is! Oh, wonderful, you wonderful men. Where's the rest?
MULVEY=>This is all we have.
MRS. HYLTON=>I'm so disappointed! But this is wonderful. I gave it to my daughter when she graduated from college. She was heart-broken when -- Isn't it precious? I love to glitter. It's a fixation. My, you're nice looking. Sit down, gentlemen, get comfortable.
MULVEY=>Mrs. Hylton -- is your daughter here? I'd like to talk to her.
MRS. HYLTON=>She's due any minute for dinner -- it's her night with Momma. One of those career girls -- has her own apartment -- works. That's what you get when you send them to Vassar.
MULVEY=>If she doesn't live with you, how is it her ring was stolen from here?
MRS. HYLTON=>That was last December. She was living with me then.
MULVEY=>I see... Now... ah... I wonder if by any chance...
GIRL'S VOICE=>Mother? I'm here.
HALLORAN=>Niles -- he's the connection!
MULVEY=>Easy, lad. You told me your name was Ruth Young -- not Hylton.
MRS. HYLTON=>Ruth's my daughter by a first marriage. She kept her father's name. How do you know these men?
RUTH=>They're investigating Jean Dexter's murder. Jean modeled with me at the shop, Mother.
MRS. HYLTON=>Imagine! Look, darling.
RUTH=>My ring!
MRS. HYLTON=>They brought it. Aren't they wonderful?
RUTH=>How did you get it?
MULVEY=>Your friend was wearing it when she was murdered.
RUTH=>Jean?
MRS. HYLTON=>How did she get it?
MULVEY=>I was hoping your daughter would tell us that.
RUTH=>I have no idea. It was stolen with the other things. What did you mean before when you said, 'Niles -- he's the connection?'
RUTH=>What did you mean? Please...
MULVEY=>He was just wondering, Miss... how your ring came to be on her finger.
RUTH=>You don't think Robert...? But that's silly. He hardly knew Jean.
MULVEY=>That ring on your hand now... is it your engagement ring?
RUTH=>Yes.
MULVEY=>Might I see it?
MULVEY=>A pearl in an old-fashioned setting. Unusual.
MULVEY=>Jimmy --
RUTH=>What are you doing?
MULVEY=>I'm sorry, Miss. We're checking your ring to see if it was stolen.
RUTH=>You don't mind if I feel rather insulted, do you?
MULVEY=>I'd expect you to.
MRS. HYLTON=>I'm sure you have to question everyone who knew Miss Dexter -- but this is fantastic.
RUTH=>Do you honestly think either Robert or I had anything to do with her murder?
MULVEY=>Just earning my salary, Miss.
HALLORAN=>When did Niles give you this ring?
RUTH=>About six weeks ago.
HALLORAN=>On January 8th, Mrs. Charles Franklyn, 382 Fern Ave., New Rochelle, reported the loss of this ring in a robbery.
RUTH=>Mother, if you don't mind, I won't have supper with you tonight.
MRS. HYLTON=>Of course, dear. Robert, a thief? But he's so educated. He studied philosophy in college...
MULVEY=>Miss Young.
MULVEY=>Where are you going?
RUTH=>Whatever you're thinking, I know the sort of man Robert is. There's some explanation of this, and he'll give it to me.
MULVEY=>Okay -- but we'll have to go with you.
RUTH=>Oh! That's quite all right... Good-bye, Mother. I'll call you.
MULVEY=>Good night, M'am.
MRS. HYLTON=>Upsetting... everything's always so upsetting.
MAID=>Isn't Miss Ruth staying to supper?
MRS. HYLTON=>No... no, she isn't... I'll eat alone... Put on some music, Margaret... a rhumba.
MULVEY=>Is Niles in?
PERELLI=>Went in about half an hour ago.
MULVEY=>Alone?
PERELLI=>Yeah.
PERELLI=>Apartment 7 E. Building on the corner.
MULVEY=>You can go home now.
PERELLI=>Thanks... I'm dead. S'long.
MULVEY=>Good night.
MULVEY=>Niles!
MULVEY=>Stand back.
MULVEY=>The window!
MAN'S VOICE=>What's going on here?
A WOMAN'S VOICE=>Police -- somebody call the police.
MAN=>What's going on there? What's the matter?
HALLORAN=>Police! Did you see a man run out of here?
MAN=>That way! Around the corner!
HALLORAN=>Police emergency! Is there any way of stopping that train at the next station -- keeping the doors locked?
ATTENDANT=>The train that just pulled out? Well, yes, I -- I guess there is. Let's see now. I'd have to call the main office first... ...or maybe I better call the 86th Street station. Which do you think?
HALLORAN=>Never mind. Thanks just the same.
A WOMAN'S VOICE=>Isn't anybody going to call the police?
A MAN'S VOICE=>What for? Somebody found somebody else in the wrong apartment, that's all.
MULVEY=>Listen to me, everybody -- this is Lieutenant Mulvey of the Police Department talking. The trouble's all over. Get quiet now and go back to sleep.
RUTH=>Darling, darling... Robert, Robert. Maybe some whiskey would help.
MULVEY=>Whiskey's not the thing to mix with chloroform. Suppose you go into the kitchen and see if there's a spot of coffee on the stove. It'll do fine, even if it's cold.
MULVEY=>Come on now, my sleepin' beauty... wake up. That's the sweet lad.
RUTH=>I found some cold tea.
MULVEY=>That'll do fine. He's waking up now.
RUTH=>Robert, darling.
NILES=>Hello, Ruth.
MULVEY=>A touching scene. The cold tea'll do him more good.
HALLORAN=>He got away. On the subway, I think.
MULVEY=>Get a look at him?
HALLORAN=>No. He was a big man -- that's all I got. What do I smell in here?
MULVEY=>Chloroform. I think this is our friend McGillicuddy again.
HALLORAN=>Oh!
MULVEY=>You awake?
NILES=>I've got a head like a beehive.
NILES=>Is that towel wet?
RUTH=>Want any more tea, darling?
NILES=>No.
MULVEY=>While you're thinking up a nice story about what didn't happen -- suppose you tell us what did?
NILES=>I don't know.
MULVEY=>Complete blackout, eh?
NILES=>I was packing a bag and... I thought I heard a noise. Just as I started to turn I got hit -- ...I remember falling to my knees -- and... that's all.
MULVEY=>Listen, Niles -- you came very close to not waking up at all. The party that killed Jean Dexter tried the same business on you. Who was it?
NILES=>How on earth would I know?
MULVEY=>If you're afraid, I'll guarantee you police protection.
NILES=>If I knew, I'd tell you. I'm not a fool. Do you think I enjoyed this?
MULVEY=>Got any guess who it was?
NILES=>It must've been a burglar. Came in by the fire escape, I suppose.
MULVEY=>A burglar? Maybe he stole something.
MULVEY=>He got it -- didn't he?
NILES=>No... no... there's nothing missing. I don't have any valuables.
MULVEY=>What were you just looking for so hard -- your B.V.D.'s.?
NILES=>I thought... I forgot this was in my pocket.
NILES=>It's my one valuable -- I only got it two weeks ago -- it's expensive.
MULVEY=>Jimmy --
NILES=>What are you doing?
NILES=>Why'd you come down here anyway?
NILES=>You want to know something, Lieutenant? You're going to have a lawsuit on your hands. You can --
HALLORAN=>Forrest C. Broughton, 85 West 68th Street, reported the loss of this cigarette lighter three weeks ago. Night robbery.
NILES=>What kind of a deal is this?
MULVEY=>You tell us.
NILES=>If you think I'm a thief, you're crazy. Honey, this is the craziest thing I ever heard of.
RUTH=>Sweetheart -- this is a terrible thing to ask you right now, but... my engagement ring -- where'd you buy it?
NILES=>What?
RUTH=>Robert, darling -- please -- where'd you buy it?
NILES=>It was from a private party.
RUTH=>Who, Robert?
NILES=>I can't tell you.
RUTH=>Please, sweetheart, you must. Don't you understand? --
MULVEY=>Where'd you get the cigarette case you sold this morning?
ROBERT=>What?
MULVEY=>How'd you get this cigarette lighter?
RUTH=>Robert -- tell them -- please, tell them.
MULVEY=>Why'd you buy a plane ticket for Mexico City?
NILES=>Why, I --
RUTH=>What ticket? When?
MULVEY=>He was supposed to leave tomorrow noon.
RUTH=>Is that true?
RUTH=>Robert -- is it true?
NILES=>A business trip --
RUTH=>We had lunch today. Why didn't you...?
NILES=>Something came up this afternoon.
MULVEY=>You're lying -- you bought the ticket in the morning.
NILES=>You've got the wrong man if you think I stole those things. I wouldn't steal a piece of bread if I was starving. That isn't how I was brought up. I come from a decent family.
MULVEY=>Congratulations.
NILES=>I got this lighter as a present. You can't send me to prison for that.
MULVEY=>Who gave it to you?
NILES=>Jean Dexter. Now you prove she didn't.
MULVEY=>And the cigarette case you sold this morning?
NILES=>The same.
RUTH=>And my engagement ring?
NILES=>Sure -- Jean gave me that too.
RUTH=>My engagement ring?
NILES=>You heard me.
RUTH=>No, no, darling, don't say a thing like that. That would be horrible. And I know it's a lie. You hardly knew Jean --
NILES=>I'm sorry, Ruth.
RUTH=>I don't believe you. Robert, I love you. I'll marry you now -- tonight. But say you're lying about Jean. If you're a thief, I'll stand by you, I'll --
NILES=>And go to prison? In a pig's eye I will. Those things were presents -- presents -- your ring was a present -- from Jean --
RUTH=>Robert --
RUTH=>You're lying. You're lying. You're lying.
MULVEY=>Niles -- you're under arrest.
NILES=>Arrest me all you like. But try to prove something against me -- try it -- just try it.
GIRL=>Mother, Mother, I am ill; Call the doctor over the hill;
GIRL'S VOICE=>In came the doctor, in came the nurse, In came the lady with the alligator purse --
GIRL=>I don't want the doctor, I don't want the nurse. I don't want the lady with the alligator purse.
HALLORAN'S VOICE=>Dan...
HALLORAN=>I'm not sure but I think maybe I've found a connection between these jewel robberies and the Dexter murder.
MULVEY=>Oh?
GIRL'S VOICE=>Out went the doctor, Out went the nurse, Out went the lady with the alligator purse.
HALLORAN=>Have you read this autopsy report on Peter Backalis?
MULVEY=>Not yet.
HALLORAN=>Yesterday morning some kids swimming in the East River found a body. Medical examiner says he died of drowning -- had a head injury and was full of whiskey. His verdict is accidental death.
MULVEY=>Well?...
HALLORAN=>But look at this: Jean Dexter died between one and two A.M. Monday morning. This guy Backalis died between three and six A.M. the same morning.
MULVEY=>Show me that it's more than a coincidence.
HALLORAN=>I can't show you, Dan... but the man had a record. He served two years in Sing Sing for stealing jewelry.
MULVEY=>Now look -- Niles and Dexter were dealing in stolen jewelry, sure. But it was society stuff. What does Backalis's record show?
HALLORAN=>I didn't think of that. It was small time -- a pawn shop robbery in Queens.
MULVEY=>Y'see? I'm afraid these two cases are miles apart. If we drag every petty jewelry thief into this, we'll go crazy. But you're not convinced, are you?
HALLORAN=>I don't know, Dan. Trouble is, where are we on the Dexter case?
MULVEY=>This morning I sent out photos of Niles and Dexter to every Police Department on the East Coast. They'll check all jewelers.
HALLORAN=>Where can that lead?
MULVEY=>That's how you run a case, lad... from step to step.
HALLORAN=>Do me a favor, Dan. Let me waste some time on this Backalis angle.
MULVEY=>Okay, lad. Phone in once a day.
HALLORAN=>Thanks.
MULVEY=>By the way...
MULVEY=>This is only the third day now on the Dexter murder. The Department never calls a case unsolved in less than twenty years. Don't get impatient.
HALLORAN=>Good deal. Twenty years from now, I'll put my kid on it.
NARRATOR=>Button, button, who's got the button?
CLERK=>Backalis's parole officer was Charles Freed. County Courthouse in the Bronx.
HALLORAN=>Well, tell me this, Mr. Freed... Do you think Backalis could get so drunk he'd fall down on a pier, hurt himself and topple into the river?
FREED=>I doubt it. He seemed like one of those steady, all-day drinkers -- always with a load on, but never wobbly.
HALLORAN=>Who was the arresting officer?
FREED=>Patrolman Albert Hicks -- Queensboro Precinct Station, Long Island City.
HALLORAN=>Right on my doorstep! What do you know...
HALLORAN=>About two and a half years ago you arrested Peter Backalis on a pawnshop entry.
HICKS=>That's right.
HALLORAN=>Did he do that job alone?
HICKS=>No -- there was another guy with him -- a feller he called Willie.
HALLORAN=>What happened to him?
HICKS=>He got away by the neatest trick I've ever seen. I nailed Backalis in the back alley. He yelled "Beat it, Willie," and this other customer throws a chair through a plate glass window -- dives right after it -- and comes up on his feet like an acrobat. Then he's off like a streak.
HALLORAN=>How was this fellow built?
HICKS=>Big -- like an all-American fullback... And listen... something funny about him. One of the things the owner reported missing was a harmonica. Now there's no resale value in a thing like that. So I always figured he must've liked to play one.
HALLORAN=>Maybe you're right. Much obliged.
MULVEY=>A big man who's an acrobat, eh? Jimmy, I don't know where you're going -- but I'm gonna start in and help you. I'm giving you Fowler and Constentino, starting tomorrow morning. Right.
HALLORAN=>'Bye, Dan.
NARRATOR=>His name is Willie -- maybe. He might've been a professional acrobat -- maybe. He might be the man we're looking for... maybe. Oh, yes -- he's a big man. Only half a million big men in New York.
BOOKING AGENT=>...Not that I can remember. I been booking vaudeville acts, circus acts, night club acts, for thirty years. Lot of queer eggs among 'em -- but a acrobat who played the harmonica? That queer I never saw one.
HALLORAN=>Okay... thanks.
STILLMAN=>A harmonica player? No, sir, brother. A character like that I wouldn't even let work out here.
CONSTENTINO=>Who runs this joint?
TRAINER=>I do. What do you want?
CONSTENTINO=>Police.
CONSTENTINO=>Any of you guys ever know a wrestler who liked to play the harmonica?
TRAINER=>Sure -- Willie the harmonica player -- Willie Garza -- I teached him to wrastle.
WRESTLER=>You didn't teach him so good. I kokalized him in Scranton five years ago.
CONSTENTINO=>Where's he now?
TRAINER=>Don't know -- don't care. He borrowed thirty-eight bucks from me once, never paid it back. A lousola.
CONSTENTINO=>Where'd he used to live?
TRAINER=>Don't know.
WRESTLER=>In Staten Island -- with his brother.
CONSTENTINO=>What's his brother's name?
WRESTLER=>Garza. All brothers got the same names.
CONSTENTINO=>I mean his first name.
WRESTLER=>I dunno.
CONSTENTINO=>Okay.
FOREMAN=>Hey, Garza -- Eddie --
FOREMAN=>These guys are police -- want to talk to you.
EDDIE GARZA=>Something happen to my wife?
HALLORAN=>Oh, no. We just saw her. That's how we found out where you work.
EDDIE GARZA=>What is it?
HALLORAN=>We're looking for your brother -- Willie.
EDDIE GARZA=>Me an' my brother Willie ain't got nothing to do with each other. He's no good.
CONSTENTINO=>When'd you see him last?
EDDIE GARZA=>Three months ago about. Tried to sell me a diamond ring for my wife. I told him to go blow.
HALLORAN=>Any idea at all where he lives?
EDDIE GARZA=>He had a room somewhere around the Williamsburg Bridge. That's all I know.
CONSTENTINO=>You got a picture of him?
EDDIE GARZA=>No. But when he was wrestlin' the newspapers printed his mug a few times.
HALLORAN=>Okay.
EDDIE GARZA=>If you send him up, do me a favor... throw the keys away.
HALLORAN=>The first guy to get a lead report to Mulvey.
NARRATOR=>Lady -- did you ever see a man looked like this?
NARRATOR=>Hey, buddy, ever see a man looked like this?
NARRATOR=>How's your memory for faces, Mac?
NARRATOR=>Here's a chance to get a promotion, men. Just spot this guy out of half a million people.
NARRATOR=>Another day...
NARRATOR=>...work day...
NARRATOR=>...hot summer day...
HALLORAN=>Hello, Dan... Jimmy. No... nothing so far. Sure, I'll keep going. What's doing at your end?
MULVEY=>Doing fine here. I'm talking to that clean-cut young American beauty again. I think he's going to tell us something this morning. Okay -- report in.
NILES=>I've told you everything I know.
MULVEY=>No, you haven't, sonny. But you will.
MULVEY=>Come in, Mr. McCormick.
MULVEY=>Recognize this man?
MCCORMICK=>I certainly do.
MULVEY=>Sit down. If there's any more of that, you'll get yourself in trouble. Getting quite a slapping around these days, aren't you?
MCCORMICK=>I came all the way down from Boston to do that. That smooth-talking crook came to me with an introduction I had to honor. He gave me a song and dance -- his sister was terribly sick -- needed an operation -- he was trying to sell her jewels. I paid him over three thousand dollars. Now it turns out to be stolen property.
NILES=>Are you paying him to say that, Mulvey? You still can't prove anything.
MCCORMICK=>I can. I run my business with great care. This is the letter of introduction he brought with him.
MULVEY=>Dr. Lawrence Stoneman!
MCCORMICK=>He treated my mother some years ago. I had to honor his letter.
MULVEY=>Will you wait outside, Mr. McCormick?
MULVEY=>How do you get a letter of introduction from a man like Stoneman? You're going to the penitentiary, Niles. But from now on in, the length of your sentence depends on you. Stealing jewelry is one thing -- but murder is different.
NILES=>You know I didn't kill her! I was at the Trinidad Club. There are witnesses.
MULVEY=>Then who did kill her?
NILES=>I don't know.
MULVEY=>Who's Henderson?
NILES=>I don't know.
MULVEY=>Listen, young fellow... you'll get five years for stealing jewelry. But you'll get another ten years for obstructing justice... and ten years more for being an accessory after the fact. Now that's the way it is, sonny boy... and you know I'm not bluffing. Who's Henderson? Who's Henderson?
NILES=>Stoneman... He's Dr. Stoneman.
HALLORAN=>You got any cold root beer?
PROPRIETRESS=>Like ice.
HALLORAN=>Ever see this man?
PROPRIETRESS=>He's a box fighter?
HALLORAN=>A wrestler.
PROPRIETRESS=>Boxing, wrestling, what do I know? Five cents, pleez.
PROPRIETRESS=>Pleez.
PROPRIETRESS=>He's a feller likes to play the whatchamacallit?
HALLORAN=>The harmonica! Yes!
PROPRIETRESS=>Sure, I know him -- Willie!
HALLORAN=>Where does he live?
PROPRIETRESS=>This street someplace.
HALLORAN=>What house?
PROPRIETRESS=>Down the street someplace. I dunno.
PROPRIETRESS=>Who you, Mista?
PROPRIETRESS=>You from a collection agency, maybe?
HALLORAN=>Ben? This is Jimmy. Dan there? When he gets back, tell him I've located Garza. Somewhere on Rivington between Delancey and Essex. 'Bye.
PROPRIETRESS=>Pleez, Mista -- by me Willie's a nice feller. A man likes kids, he's nice. Any little kid asks him, Willie plays his whatchamacallit. I don't want I should make trouble for him.
HALLORAN=>Don't worry, lady.
PROPRIETRESS=>You don't want your root beer, Mista?
HALLORAN=>Does Willie Garza live here?
WOMAN=>He'sa not live here.
HALLORAN=>You sure?
WOMAN=>My hoosband he'sa janitor. I'm positive.
HALLORAN=>Thanks.
MULVEY=>Nobody gets by you.
MULVEY=>I'm Lieutenant Mulvey of the Police Department. Is Dr. Stoneman in?
NURSE=>He's with a patient.
MULVEY=>I want you to do exactly as I say, Miss. Tell the patients who are waiting that they have to leave.
NURSE=>But --
MULVEY=>Do what I say, Miss --
HALLORAN=>Do you kids know a man who lives on this street by the name of Willie Garza?
HALLORAN=>He plays the harmonica.
GIRL=>I know him. Willie.
HALLORAN=>Where does he live?
GIRL=>Across the street -- corner house, I think -- or the next one.
HALLORAN=>Good girl.
NURSE=>This is really unheard of.
MULVEY=>I know, M'am. Sit there. Don't say anything.
MULVEY=>Tell Dr. Stoneman somebody out here has to see him. Tell him to leave his patient and come out right now. And don't tell him anything else.
NURSE=>I'll lose my job over this. Doctor -- There's someone here. He has to see you. You have to come right out. You must, doctor, right now, you must.
STONEMAN=>What are you doing here?
STONEMAN=>Who are you?
MULVEY=>Lieutenant Mulvey of the Homicide Squad. Do you go by the name of Henderson?
STONEMAN=>Yes.
MULVEY=>You're under arrest for the murder of Jean Dexter.
STONEMAN=>No! I couldn't do anything like that. If anyone did it, it was him! Finished -- I'm finished now...
MULVEY=>What was your relationship to Niles and Dexter?
STONEMAN=>A lamb led to slaughter! An idiot robbed of self-respect, of manhood, of decency! I loved that girl the way a sick man loves alcohol or a narcotic. There was nothing right about it or good about it, only a sick hunger. I saw her a year ago in that dress shop. And from then on I was drunk with her, lost. For six months now I've known they've been using me. I was their tipster -- me -- Stoneman.
MULVEY=>What do you mean?
STONEMAN=>It wasn't enough I poured money out on her. Jean was twisted inside, too, like me. What does life do to people that it can set up such unnatural hungers in them -- me for a woman like her -- and she for money? She was a common thief. Both of them. They used my social connections. My wife is a partygiver. Jean'd find out from me who was to be there. And it was only after months that I realized that when someone came to my house, his apartment was robbed the same night.
MULVEY=>Why didn't you go to the police?
STONEMAN=>Why doesn't a drug addict stop taking drugs? She kept promising me each time was the last. I believed her because I wanted to believe her. I believed her because I was afraid to go to the police -- afraid of the scandal. You can read about sick people like me in medical literature. Here I am. Look at me. I'm contemptible.
MULVEY=>Did you arrange the robbery of your own apartment?
STONEMAN=>Yes. I even came to that. I was frightened and I had to wallow in my own filth. Oh, I'm so glad you came. Prison is much better than insanity -- and I'm half mad already. Oh, Stoneman, what have you become?
MULVEY=>What proof have you that you didn't kill Dexter?
STONEMAN=>Proof? I was someplace else -- Miss Owen -- my date book -- yes -- a birthday party -- at the Broughtons.
MULVEY=>Will you testify in court that Niles and Dexter did these robberies?
NILES=>I never did!
MULVEY=>Shut up.
STONEMAN=>No, they were the fixers, the smart ones. They used me one way -- they hired other men for the actual robberies.
MULVEY=>Who?
STONEMAN=>I don't know. Miss Owen -- my practice -- Oh, don't cry... You'll call Dr. Grenard. Only don't let me have to see anyone... Not my wife... no friends... no lawyer. Just lock me up and hide me away. Me? Stoneman? It's impossible. I won't have it.
STONEMAN=>I won't have it!
MULVEY=>Grab him!
MULVEY=>I don't know much about medicine, doctor -- but I'm pretty sure that's one prescription never cured anything. Thanks, Niles. And as long as you finally made up your mind to cooperate, why not go all the way? You're not stupid. You're hooked now, and you know it. So why not spill the rest? Who did the jobs for you? Who was it?
NILES=>Willie Garza. He and Backalis. They wanted more of a cut from the robberies. Garza killed Jean; then later that night he killed Backalis. I loved Jean. I didn't have anything to do with it. It was Garza... Garza... Garza...
MAN'S VOICE=>You must practice more -- practice --
GARZA'S VOICE=>Come on in!
GARZA=>I thought it was the janitor for the rent. Who're you? Don't mind me. Just having a little work-out.
HALLORAN=>My name's Hawkey -- I work up at Bellevue Hospital. Are you Willie Garza?
GARZA=>That's me. Ever see me wrestle? I wasn't so bad.
HALLORAN=>No, I never did. There's a patient at the hospital gave me your address -- asked me to see you.
GARZA=>Yeah. Who?
HALLORAN=>Backalis his name is.
GARZA=>Pete? What's he doin' in the hospital?
HALLORAN=>He almost got drowned. Fell in the river when he was plastered. Some guy on a tug boat fished him out.
GARZA=>You don't say? Oh, that Pete. Can't let the booze alone. So what does he want from me?
HALLORAN=>He says he wants to see you.
GARZA=>You know what he wants? He wants money.
GARZA=>Some condition I'm in, hey, brother? Don't smoke, don't drink. So Pete wants money again? You know what you can tell him, buddy?
GARZA=>Lay still or I'll snap your arm like a wishbone.
GARZA=>Copper, ain't you?
HALLORAN=>Yeah.
GARZA=>Just because I'm big, everybody thinks I'm dumb. I'm not dumb, I'm smart. Now how did I know you were a copper? Because nobody knows where I live -- not even Pete Backalis.
HALLORAN=>If you're smart, you'll come down to headquarters with me.
GARZA=>Ha-ha -- that wouldn't be smart. You know why? 'Cause Backalis ain't in Bellevue, he's in the morgue. Turn around.
HALLORAN=>Don't be a fool.
GARZA'S VOICE=>I'll prove I'm smart, copper. You know how? You're scared right now I'm gonna rub you out. But I ain't -- 'cause I'm smart. Ain't nobody can prove I rubbed out Backalis. So why should I knock you off? Rub out a cop an' you'll really get the chair. All I need to do is put you to sleep. Then I'm off. Try an' find me. This is a great big, beautiful city. Just try an' find me.
GARZA'S VOICE=>That was a rabbit punch, Copper. It's strictly illegal.
MULVEY=>Yeah, he signed it. Wait a minute, Ben. Keep Niles away from the newspaper men. And listen, Ben -- when Halloran calls in -- or Fowler or Constentino -- tell 'em that Willie Garza may be the gimmick in this case. So -- When did Halloran call in? Was he alone? Now get this -- send out an emergency! Rush every available squad car. Block off the street. Surround it.
PATROLMAN=>Emergency!
OPERATOR=>Emergency... All squad cars on the East Side of 14th Street to the Williamsburg Bridge, from 1st Street to 5th Avenue, proceed immediately to Rivington Street between Essex and Delancey. Block off and surround both sides of the street. Institute immediate house-to-house search for --
OPERATOR'S VOICE=>-- two men -- Detective James Halloran and William Garza. Halloran is twenty- eight years old...
MULVEY=>Jimmy!
HALLORAN=>This way.
MULVEY=>Hold all bridge traffic. Stop traffic on the Brooklyn end.
NARRATOR=>It's two o'clock in the morning now...
NARRATOR=>This is the city...
NARRATOR=>...these are the lights...
NARRATOR=>...that a child born to the name of Batory hungered for... Her passion has been played out now...
NARRATOR=>...her name, her face, her history, were worth five cents a day for six days...
NARRATOR=>...and tomorrow will be sold by the bale...
NARRATOR=>She is not quite forgotten, however...
NARRATOR=>...not altogether...
NARRATOR=>...not entirely...
NARRATOR=>...and now there is violence once again in the city...
NARRATOR=>...but of another sort.
NARRATOR=>...naked and innocent he comes into this world...
NARRATOR=>...comes to meet the city... naked into a naked city...
NARRATOR=>What will he be at twenty?
NARRATOR=>What will her boy be...
NARRATOR=>who was born at two o'clock in the morning...
NARRATOR=>...on a hot summer night...
NARRATOR=>...at the time of a shooting star?
