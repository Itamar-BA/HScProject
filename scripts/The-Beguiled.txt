MCBURNEY=>Are you frightened?
MCBURNEY=>Can you hold on just a bit, while I get my breath?
AMY=>Amelia Dabney.
EDWINA=>Yes, Miss Martha.
EMILY=>Is he breathing?
EDWINA=>Yes, Miss Martha.
AMY=>It’s about six.
MISS MARTHA=>Tell me, Miss Amy, did you find any mushrooms when you were out collecting soldiers?
MCBURNEY=>That’s very logical.
EDWINA=>Get to your work.
MCBURNEY=>Did you want to see me about something?
MCBURNEY=>Thank you very much.
MCBURNEY=>Tell, me Miss Morrow, what’s your biggest wish, if you could have anything, what would it be?
MISS MARTHA=>As dedicated Christians, let us ask the Corporal to join us in our evening prayer.
EDWINA=>Why did they come?
MISS MARTHA=>Would you care to join me for a brandy, Corporal?
MISS MARTHA=>It must be devastating.
MISS MARTHA=>Good evening, Corporal.
JANE=>Have you got it?
ALICIA=>I made apple pie.
JANE=>Oh, Miss Martha!
ALICIA=>It was terrible the way he rushed in, I was frightened half to death, and then Edwina came out and began fighting with him.
MARIE=>What did he want?
ALICIA=>How should I know?
MISS MARTHA=>What is going on here?
MCBURNEY=>You didn’t tell me it was a house of mad women. Vengeful bitches...
ALICIA=>How are you doin’?
MISS MARTHA=>Then hurry right back.
MISS MARTHA=>Won’t you come inside with me? We have one more bottle of bourbon in the cellar.
EDWINA=>Get out of my way.
MISS MARTHA=>Do you think you could do that, Amy? Find some mushrooms for the corporal?
MISS MARTHA=>You’ll have to be very careful that he doesn’t notice you leaving the house.
MCBURNEY=>What about you, Miss Morrow?
MCBURNEY=>Mmmm... Miss Amy, you picked these yourself?
