SUPERTITLE: SUN CITY, ARIZONA=>We are floating through America’s premiere master-planned retirement community -- a geriatric Eden. As this living brochure continues, we catch glimpses of: -- THE GOLF COURSE where a FEMALE SENIOR tees off as TWO GOLFERS stand by. THWACK! -- THE FIRING RANGE OLD MEN hold rifles and shoot at targets. -- THE POOL A GROUP OF ELDERLY WOMEN in bathing caps rehearse a SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING ROUTINE a la Esther Williams. -- ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET A handsome ELDERLY COUPLE on A BICYCLE BUILT FOR TWO. As soon as the bicycle has cleared frame, the CAMERA PICKS OUT A HOUSE and begins to MOVE SLOWLY toward the drawn curtains of the front window. This is one of Sun City’s more humble model-home offerings. Eventually we are transported into --
A BEDROOM=>Through the door we see an obstructed view of DORIS METZGER, 80, a frail woman sitting on the side of her hospital-style bed, staring into space. She is being attended to by a home- health-care worker, EDUARDO, 45, in green surgical scrubs and a hair-net. He WALKS IN AND OUT of VIEW as he prepares Doris for her day.
EDUARDO=>Somebody forgot something in the bathroom!
EDUARDO=>Take care of your business in the bathroom, Mr. Savage.
SUPERTITLE: NEW YORK CITY=>The camera comes to rest on A PARTIALLY OPEN WINDOW with blowing sheer curtains that looks out over the streets of New York City’s East Valley on a wintery night.
A LOUD BUZZER BUZZES.=>Wendy, slightly startled, clicks the machine off and, still holding the can of cat food, heads to the door. THE CAMERA stays behind, PANNING OFF of Wendy and PUSHING INTO A CLOSE UP OF THE ANSWERING MACHINE still blinking ominously. AT THE DOOR -- Wendy presses her eye to the peephole. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE -- LARRY, an attractive middle-aged guy, stands in the hall. With a quick fluff of her hair, Wendy opens the door.
WENDY=>No, come on Larry. LARRY
LARRY=>What’s the matter?
JON=>What’s going on?
ANSWERING MACHINE=>Aloha, Wendy? This is Nancy --
PITCHED CHIPMUNK SOUND.=>Jon holds his head in his hand like it’s going to explode.
THE SCREEN DOOR=>Jon pushes the DOORBELL. No response. Wendy presses her face up to the screen and looks inside. WENDY’S POV of THE FOYER -- Her eyes land on an ALUMINUM WALKER. Jon KNOCKS lightly on the screen.
JON=>What do you mean? BILL
JON=>Dad! Dad! Stop.
JON=>Well, what then?
WENDY=>Like Aunt Gertie. JON
WENDY=>What kind of place?
WENDY=>How’re you feeling? LENNY
THWAK! SPLAT!=>ON THE DRIVER’S SIDE WINDOW -- A HAND APPEARS, wiping away the snow and frost to reveal a frantic Wendy.
WENDY=>Where’s the view?
JIMMY=>Good to meet you. LENNY
WENDY=>Jon, what’s Zocor?
WENDY=>Hey, I take that. The administrator looks up.
ADMINISTRATOR=>The only other thing missing is the paperwork regarding funeral arrangements. We’ll need to know about your father’s burial or cremation plans.
JON=>Would you want a breathing machine to keep you alive?
KASIA=>Sorry to scare you. WENDY
WENDY=>Was it emotional?
JON=>No. Not really.
JON=>Hook it to this.
JON=>Wendy! Give me my mail.
JON=>The Guggenheim?
WENDY=>I just found out. JON
WENDY=>Will you please -- LARRY
LARRY=>No problem... Wen? WENDY
COUNSELOR=>There’s plenty of room up front.
WOMAN=>You must be the Savages.
WENDY=>It’s someone else. Sorry, he’s kind of...
AIDE=>That’s alright. It’s Howard, Mr. Savage. I’m here to put you in bed. Thursday is Jimmy’s night off.
WENDY=>I better get going. Good night. Dad.
WENDY=>Hello bundle. Hello beast. Did you remember her papers?
WENDY=>I’ll see you later.
WENDY=>Is that my ficus?
WENDY=>What do you think? LARRY
LARRY=>You're thirty-nine.
WENDY=>You're fifty-two. LARRY
LARRY=>The professor character in “The Blue Angel,” the film.
LARRY=>Why do you do this? WENDY
JON=>What’s going on with that?
SIMONE=>What's it look like?
WENDY=>Big. Red. Pillow.
WENDY=>Here you go, Dad.
JON=>Wendy, forget it. LENNY
HIS BEAT UP VAN=>He opens the passenger side door and quickly clears off the seat by tossing some of the junk into the back. He helps Wendy in and hands her the cat carrier.
JIMMY=>Like Shakespeare? WENDY
WENDY=>Why, do you think? JIMMY
WENDY=>Jon, it’s locked.
WENDY=>You were policing me. You're sick. That's sick, Jon.
MUTED HAZE.=>A small expression of relief comes over Lenny’s face as he drifts into what looks like a state of content resignation. His eyelids get heavy. He looks at Jon and Wendy. They continue to argue, but THE WORDS ARE MURKY. They might be saying something like this:
JON=>That's not true.
JON=>Feema? Feema... FEMA. Federal Emergency Management?
JIMMY=>I read your play. WENDY
JIMMY=>It’s good to cry.
JIMMY=>No. You’re great...you’re funny and I like your play...
LITTER BOX.=>The trunk lid pops open, momentarily hiding Jimmy. And then it’s slammed shut and Jimmy reappears. He waves. Wendy waves back as the car pulls away.
JON=>Excuse me for one minute.
LARRY=>I saw you come in.
LARRY=>I’m sorry about your Dad.
A THEATER=>The kitchen is a set in a little downtown space. The boy and the father are actors in a play. We are witnessing some kind of TECHNICAL REHEARSAL. A LIGHTING DESIGNER is programming cues. Wendy is there in the nearly empty house. She, responds not to the actor on stage, but to the DIRECTOR who is seated beside her.
WENDY=>Thanks for coming.
JON=>It’s good, Wendy.
JON=>Wish me luck on my paper.
WENDY=>What’s it called? JON
JON=>You didn’t ask.
