BACK:=>The Comtess whispers behind her fan to her husband:
BACK:=>Philippe nods and a worried sort of expression comes over his face--He replies:

BACK STAGE.=>LONG SHOT
BACK:=>Joseph rewards Simon with a grateful smile - smacks his lips and ambles off with Simon watching after him, with brotherly interest and affection. When Simon turns casually and looks toward dressing room corridor, he starts in annoyance, as he sees:

BACK:=>Carlotta bursts into scornful laughter - she'll show them --they won't put anything over on her so clumsy as all that.
BACK:=>The girl finishes speech and lends the glasses to her eager and interested companion who looks as directed by the other.

BACK:=>Philippe gasps in surprise first - then he too becomes angry and he answers:
BACK:=>Raoul's eyes light up with a dangerous light - Philippe sees this and shrugging his shoulders, goes back into the box. Raoul hesitates for a second, to cool down, then follows.
BACK:=>Everyone recoils in horror and dismay - the Persian lets out a deep sigh and exits - they all look
