SALESPERSON=>Ladies, I need you to keep it down in there. We do have other customers.
SARAH=>Can’t be around people crying. !All sad and stuff -- LAINE
FLASH OF LIGHT.=>Laine takes a ‘snapscan’ of the photo with her iPad. !She opens up the image in her photo app and ENLARGES THE PICTURE. She scrolls around. !Down to the Ouija board. !That WEIRD GLARE. Laine taps -- blows the photo up even more. !The glare seems to perfectly highlight the word GOOD BYE at the bottom of the Ouija board.!! Off of Laine’s puzzled expression cut to -- EXT. DEBBIE’S HOUSE - DAY Debbie’s house sits in late afternoon shadows. Curtains drawn. Trevor’s car pulls up in front. Laine gets out and heads around the side of the house.
LAINE=>Mrs. G? Hello?
LAINE=>Somebody there?
PLASTIC HANGING BAGS.=>Laine startles, as --
SARAH=>Wait. What? -- LAINE
LAINE=>She’s spelling something.
TREVOR=>It’s not her --
LAINE=>How's your hand?
LAINE=>299. !300. !301.
TREVOR=>That was her last entry... written the day she died. And you’re sure she never says a name of who she’s playing with...
NONA=>These girls...
...SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH.=>Trevor stops. Silencing the clicking of his bike so he can hear better. The SCRATCHING gets louder... like nails on a chalkboard echoing in this concrete corridor.
HIP PODCAST GUY=>...and you can take part in the world’s biggest Ouija game ever...
SARAH=>So what? !I don't see anyone taking their hand away.
LAINE=>Not everything. Pete’s not here. Maybe because there were five of us who made initial contact... something about our collective energy.
TREVOR=>It’s okay, Iz. Laine, go ahead. Invite him over.
PETE=>'Finish game.'
UNDER THEIR FINGERS!=>Isabelle is the first to bail. She yanks her hand away and scrambles back from the board. All of them now pull their hands away... backing away as blinding light fills the room. Laine’s the last one at the board. She pulls her hand away -- -- AND THE PLANCHETTE IS STILL MOVING. BY ITSELF! It’s like a living thing twitching on the floor.
LAINE=>Iz, it’s okay --
PETE=>No. It’s over.
LAINE AND DEBBIE=>As friends we’ve gathered, hearts are true. Spirits near, we call to you.
DEBBIE=>That’s not me --
LAINE=>-- yeah, right.
DEBBIE!=>Her name? !Laine. Hey. You know the future, D.Z. Right? Will we be friends again... me and Laine?
DEBBIE=>That’s not me --
LAINE=>-- Yeah, right.
TREVOR=>You made us play.
IN THE HALLWAY.=>Laine sees how panicked her sister is. The tears on her face. And Sarah keeps looking back at the classroom door.
LAINE=>C’mon... almost there.
COLLIDING RIGHT INTO LAINE!=>Laine’s light finally settles to see that it’s Sarah. Her eyes are dazed. She looks totally disoriented. Traumatized. Laine holds her sister. Brushing the hair out of her face. Sarah’s so scared, trying to get the words out --
SARAH=>Don’t leave me. LAINE
LAINE=>But I’m here. I’m ready.
