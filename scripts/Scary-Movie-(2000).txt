DREW=>Hi Bill. Look, I can't talk right now.
V.O. BILL=>Aw, come on. It took two bottles of Wild Turkey to get Hillary to sleep. Can't you just talk for a minute?
DREW=>I'm sorry. I can't. I got company coming any second.
V.O. BILL=>Alright, well give me a kiss.
DREW=>Pervert.
DREW=>Look Bill, I told you�
SCARY VOICE=>Who's Bill? Is that your boyfriend?
DREW=>Who is this?
SCARY VOICE=>Tell me your name and I'll tell you mine.
DREW=>I don't think so.
SCARY VOICE=>What's that noise?
DREW=>Oops, I farted, I didn't think you would hear me.
SCARY VOICE=>No, that popping noise.
DREW=>Oh, I'm making popcorn. I'm getting ready to watch a video.

DREW=>Oh my God! You can see me? I haven't even finished putting on my make-up!
SCARY VOICE=>Don't ever hang up on me again!
DREW=>What do you want?
SCARY VOICE=>To see you split up the middle.
DREW=>Sorry, I don't do G-strings.
DREW=>Look you asshole. My boyfriend's gonna be here any second, and he plays football, and he'll kick the shit out of you.
SCARY VOICE=>Oh, really? Turn on the porch lights.
DREW=>That's not my boyfriend. I fucked him a couple of times. But that's all.
DREW=>Look, I'm calling the cops.
SCARY VOICE=>Aren't you going to answer the door?
DREW=>Please�stop�
SCARY VOICE=>Answer it.

LITTLE BOY=>I can't feel my legs�
KILLER=>Hello Drew.
OF=>HER BODY.
LEAKING=>BREAST IMPLANT.
DREW=>Daddy, mommy, help! Help me!
MOM=>Did you hear something?
DAD=>Nah, I didn't hear nothing.
DAWSON CAST MEMBER=>Sorry, wrong set.
CINDY=>Bobby, what are you doing? My dad's in the other room.
BOBBY=>It just occurred to me I never climbed in your window before.
CINDY=>Well, now that you got it out of
DAD=>What's going on in there?
CINDY=>Can you knock?
DAD=>I thought I heard screaming.
CINDY=>No, you didn't.
DAD=>Must have been those 'shrooms I had earlier. Look, I gotta leave town. A recent business venture went bad, some money came up missing. I gotta lay low for a while. If a man named Tito calls, tell him to page me. If they raid the place�
CINDY=>I never heard of you.
DAD=>And don't forget�
CINDY=>�to flush your stash.
DAD=>If you need some money, I left a little something in the coffee can. Be sure to cut it or somebody's gonna O.D.
CINDY=>Have a good trip.
DAD=>Sleep tight sweetie.
CINDY=>That was close.
BOBBY=>I was home watching "The Exorcist", and it got me thinking of you.
CINDY=>If this is about the time I puked green slime and masturbated with a crucifix, it was my first keg party.
BOBBY=>No, the movie was edited for T.V. All the good stuff was cut out.
CINDY=>So you thought you would just climb through my window and we would play bump bump?
BOBBY=>Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked but I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some "on top of the clothes" stuff.
CINDY=>Okay, just for a minute.
BOBBY=>I see.
CLIMBS=>OUT THE WINDOW.
CINDY=>Okay stud, you have to go now.
CINDY=>I appreciate the romantic gesture.
BOBBY=>See what you do to me?
CINDY=>Hey, would you settle for PG-13?
CINDY=>Goodnight�
BRANDY=>Come on, girl, move your tired white ass.
CINDY=>I'm coming.
BRANDY=>Move your pasty white, milk chalky, bologna smelling, cracker devil, honky bit�
CINDY=>Hello?!
BRANDY=>I'm sorry girl. I rented "Amistad" last night. I got issues. It's cool. Come on, we're gonna be late.
CINDY=>Wait, there's Buffy.
BRANDY=>I don't know why you hang out with her. She's such a ho.
CINDY=>Why do you say that?
BRANDY=>Cause I've seen her. My friend Sean had a pool party this summer.
CINDY=>Sean?
BRANDY=>You know, Puff Daddy.
BRANDY=>Anyways, everybody was drinking Crystal champagne. Then it started to get wild, people was getting freaky in the pool and stuff. I looked over and there was your girl getting buck wild in the Jacuzzi.
CINDY=>So?
BRANDY=>With a backup dancer! That's lower than a security guard! At least security can get you backstage.
CINDY=>I think Buffy is sweet.
BRANDY=>She's as fake as press on nails.
BRANDY=>Hey girl, what's up?
BRANDY=>Hey, lookin' good, love your hair!
BUFFY=>Thanks, just got it done.
CINDY=>Bye Mr. Gilmore!
BUFFY=>Is he gone?
CINDY=>Yes.
BUFFY=>I love this color!
CINDY=>Let me see that.
CINDY=>You guys shouldn't use this brand.
BRANDY=>Why not?
CINDY=>Because they test their make-up on animals.
BRANDY=>So?
CINDY=>Have you seen what they do to those poor animals?
BUFFY=>I'd rather help my fellow man than some animal.
HOMELESS MAN=>Spare a dollar?
BUFFY=>Get away from me you bum!
CINDY=>Buffy!? Can't you see that he's just hungry?
CINDY=>Here you go. A nice sandwich.
HOMELESS MAN=>I said a dollar bitch!
BUFFY=>God, look at this place, it's a circus!
GAIL HAILSTORM,=>syndicated talk show host and author.
GAIL=>A brutal killing spree that left one teen dead.
GAIL=>Correction, two teens dead.
WHITE MALE REPORTER=>Police are searching for clues.
BLACK MALE REPORTER=>Reporting live for Black TV. White folks are dead, and we are about to get the hell out of here! Let's roll, Jack.
BRANDY=>Do you believe this?
CINDY=>What happened?
BUFFY=>Didn't you hear? Drew Decker got killed last night.
BRANDY=>Was she a friend?
CINDY=>No, I was gonna cheat off her test today. Now I'm like fucked! Do they know who did it?
BRANDY=>Clueless.
BUFFY=>They showed a picture of her body on the news. It was pretty scary.
CINDY=>All the blood?
BUFFY=>No, she was wearing a Gucci sweater and Payless shoes! That's such a fashion disaster! Do you think the press is going to interview us?
BRANDY=>No way. The press only want to interview the most ignorant person they can find.
REPORTER=>Can we have a word with you?
SHORTY=>Oh shit, I'm on TV. I wanna give a shout out to Shane and dem! Peace to my peeps, much love to the east and west, Tasha, wake up, the baby's daddy is a staraah!!
REPORTER=>What can you tell us about Drew Decker?
SHORTY=>She got a fat ass, kid! Ya know what I mean?
SHORTY=>Yo, son, I'm with you. Just do that shit.
SHORTY=>Yo, son, that's fucked up that Drew got killed.
SHORTY=>I didn't even get to fuck her.
SHORTY=>I'm just glad that it wasn't one of us.
SHORTY=>Yo, son, don't you know? A brotha' never lasts long in these types of situations.
SHORTY=>Kid, in the most successful horror flicks, most niggas don't even make it to the credits, yo.
SHORTY=>That's why we as a people have to come together and show up to the movies on time if we want to see our black people die. If you stop to get a forty, you could miss the whole thing.
SHORTY=>'Cause you know they ain't gone never let us play the homeopathic killer.
SHORTY=>Oh, sure there's that one cat, Candyman, but they don't even let that brotha wear a mask. Why not? Jason, Michael Myers, even the Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry covers half his face.
SHORTY=>But see, the thing is, they don't fit a description. On the other
SHORTY=>And tell me this, why he always got to be on C.P. time?
SHORTY=>You've got to call the brotha' repetitiously before he even shows up. Candyman! Candyman! Candyman! Nigga' you hear me callin you. Bring your pimp lookin ass on. Off chasing white girls. That's what got your hands cut off in the first place. Which brings me to my point, son.
SHORTY=>Yo, it all started with a white girl. So you know what that means.
SHORTY=>Drew's dead. We black. Candy. Man. It's so obvious, kid.
SHORTY=>I've got the munchies like a mutha' fucka'.
V.O.=>Hey ladies!
CINDY=>Hi Shorty.
BRANDY=>Talk to the hand.
SHORTY=>Cindy?
CINDY=>Can't Shorty.
SHORTY=>Oh well, you force me to open it up to hundreds of other girls who would die for the opportunity, but just because I like you guys, I'm gonna wait till lunch before I go public. See ya at the fountain.
BUFFY=>Whatever! What a geek!
CINDY=>I think Shorty is cute. If I wasn't dating Bobby, I would go out with him.
BRANDY=>Shit girl, Bobby lives in a trailer. Dating Shorty would be a step up.
CINDY=>If how much money a guy has is so important, why are you dating Ray?
BRANDY=>First of all, look at him. He's 100% man.
RAY=>Yo, man, this shirt make me look gay.
GREG=>Nah.
RAY=>How about now?
BRANDY=>Besides, the boys got potential, girl. Ray runs a 4.4 40, has a 3.5 GPA and he's being scouted by every major college in the country. If he stays healthy, we're talking multi million dollar contract and that's not including endorsements. Now Greg on the other hand, that's somebody else's mess.
BUFFY=>I'll admit, the pro's is a long shot for Greg. He's been injured twice and he's not that bright.
BUFFY=>And the only way we'll see him in prime time in on "Cops". But for now, he's the hottest guy in the school and even if I don't want him, I'm not going to let anyone else have him.
BRANDY=>Hey baby.
BUFFY=>What's the matter, honey?
GREG=>I got my report card.
BUFFY=>At least you got one "A".
GREG=>Yeah, I did huh?
CINDY=>Anybody seen Bobby?
RAY=>Nah. That kid is late every day. I don't get it. He lives so close.
BOBBY=>Hey guys. Hey Cind.
BOBBY=>You guys see all the reporters out there? They say that girl Drew Decker got killed last night.
RAY=>I think I knew her. She had a brother named Steve, pretty eyes, long hair, perfect ass.
BOBBY=>Yeah, that was her.
RAY=>No, I was talking about Steve. Whatever happened to him?
BOBBY=>I don't know.
CINDY=>Hey, do you guys think it's strange that she got killed exactly one year after we, you know, killed that guy?
GREG=>Hey, it was an accident.
CINDY=>Was it?
GREG=>Hey dude. Nobody drives my car but me! Well, except for that big black guy that car jacked me last month, he drove it, but other than that, nobody drives my car but me. Okay, there was that one time the dope man had it for a week because I owed him for a bag of weed, but other than
CINDY=>You know cars are only to make guys feel more secure about the size of their penises.
GREG=>What's that supposed to mean?
BOBBY=>She's kidding, come on.
GREG=>Why did you tell Cindy about it?
BUFFY=>I didn't say anything.
GREG=>Then why did she make that comment?
BUFFY=>Greg, you know I would never tell anyone our little secret.
RAY=>Here, put this on.
RAY=>Hey, it's a classic.
GREG=>Let's put on the radio.
GREG=>Now that's more like it. Yeah.
GREG=>AYOO!!!
BOBBY=>Look at what they're doing.
CINDY=>Bobby, keep your eyes on the road.
BOBBY=>When are we gonna do stuff like that?
CINDY=>One day.
CINDY=>What are you doing?
BOBBY=>I just want you to touch it.
BOBBY=>Oh yeah.
BOBBY=>Oh yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
GREG=>Look out!
BOBBY=>Oh my God!
BOBBY=>What was that?
CINDY=>I think we hit something.
BUFFY=>Oh my God! We hit a boot!
CINDY=>Ahh! It's a body!
RAY=>Is he alive?
BOBBY=>I don't know.
BUFFY=>Let me check�
BUFFY=>Hey mister, you want a blow job?
BUFFY=>He's dead. What are we gonna do?
CINDY=>We have to call the police.
RAY=>No way, I ain't going to jail.
CINDY=>We have to.
GREG=>Do you know what happens to a young boy in prison? All those sex starved convicts just waiting for a fresh piece of meat.
RAY=>You're right. Maybe we should call the police.
MAN=>That's not necessary. I'm fine.
BOBBY=>Think about it, Ray. If you do that you ruin the rest of this movie. This
RAY=>White girls?!
RAY=>What do we do first?
BOBBY=>We'll hide the body.
CINDY=>I won't have anything to do with this.
MAN=>I guess I'll be going now.
BUFFY=>What about the alcohol?
GREG=>We'll get rid of it.
GREG=>Now let's get him in the trunk. Move the car closer.
BOBBY=>We'll throw him in the ocean.
BOBBY=>We'll go down to Steveson and dump him in there. The sharks will take care of the evidence.
CINDY=>Wait. Shouldn't we check his wallet?
BUFFY=>For what?
BRANDY=>Shit, he might have some money. We already committed murder. Might as well rob his ass.
BOBBY=>Good idea. I'll take credit cards.
BRANDY=>I want the jewelry.
RAY=>I'll take his underwear.
GREG=>We must never mention this again.
GREG=>The guy we just killed.
CINDY=>Well, you just mentioned it.
GREG=>Starting now.
BOBBY=>That's all behind us now, Cindy, we have to move on.
GREG=>Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
BUFFY=>Greg's right, Cindy. I mean what do you think we're in, a horror movie?
CINDY=>Yeah, if it were, they'd probably cast some ding-bat like Jennifer Love "Huge-Tits" to play me.
GAIL V.O.=>I'm putting on my make up.
GAIL=>Close the goddamn door!
GAIL=>Sheriff, can I get a statement?
SHERIFF=>No comment.
GAIL=>Hi, Gail Hailstorm, field reporter, Hard Story.
DOOFY=>Special Officer Doofy.
GAIL=>Is there a problem on campus?
DOOFY=>Not while Doofy's on the job.
GAIL=>Well, of course not, handsome.
DOOFY=>You shouldn't be here.
GAIL=>I know. I should be on my knees covering the next presidential election. But who knew?
DOOFY=>Excuse me.
GAIL=>You look awfully young to be a police officer.
DOOFY=>I'm twenty-five and a half years old. That's this many.
GAIL=>You know, I prove to be most popular with males eleven to twenty-four. And most prison lesbians. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve. Except for that big head and glazed over look in your eyes. Ooh, look a little drool.
DOOFY=>Yeah, sometimes I forget to swallow.
GAIL=>Don't worry, I never do.
GAIL=>Remind me not to do that again.
PRINCIPAL V.O.=>Hello, due to the recent events, a curfew has been placed effective immediately.
GAIL=>Sounds like we've got a serial killer on our hands.
DOOFY=>That's official police business.
DOOFY=>I can't say mama.
GAIL=>I say, that's a mighty big night stick you got there.
DOOFY=>My mom says I can't play with it cause I might poke someone's eye out.
GAIL=>I can see how that could happen. Say, what do you say we go back to my van and get to know each other a little better?
DOOFY=>Ok.
CINDY=>You see? This is the kind of cruelty I'm talking about. What's an animal doing in here?
STUDENT=>He's our mascot. We adopted him.
CINDY=>No way. This animal is supposed to be free and spread his wings.
STUDENT=>What are you doing?
CINDY=>Fly, little birdy, soar little fella.
STUDENT=>You asshole, his wings were broken. We were nursing him back to health!
CINDY=>Oops! My bad.
MISS TATE=>A terrible tragedy and an unbearable loss. It's days like today we need prayer in school.
MISS TATE=>Here, go to your daddy.
MISS TATE=>Okay class, we've been discussing the constitution this week. Who would like to give their oral presentation first?
MISS TATE=>Okay, Heather.
HEATHER=>My presentation is on the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech.
HEATHER=>That's whats so important about the First Amendment. It gives us the right to say what we want without fear of retaliation
MISS TATE=>Aw, shut the fuck up and sit down.
MISS TATE=>Cindy, you're next. The sheriff's ready to see you.
SHERIFF=>So, who's next?

SHERIFF=>What's that God awful smell?
DOOFY=>I go poopy.
SHERIFF=>Get him outta here.
PRINCIPAL=>Doofy, it's time to go back to special ed. Maybe the sheriff will let you play later, ok.
DOOFY=>Ok.
SHERIFF=>So, how are you Cindy?
CINDY=>Fine, Sheriff and yourself?
SHERIFF=>Bloated, constipated, got a boil on my ass the size of a walnut, you know, the usual. So we wanna ask you a few questions about Drew Decker.

RAY=>Hey Greg, you comin'?
GREG=>In a minute, I'm gonna work out first.
RAY=>Okay� Alright, guys, last one in is a rotten egg.
GREG=>Where are you?! Who did this?! This isn't funny, all right? � a small dick's like a disability, man! Would you make fun of somebody in a wheelchair? Huh? Would you, you sick fuck?
GREG=>Where are you, you chicken shit?
BRANDY=>Hey girl, you okay?
CINDY=>Yeah, just that some strange things have been going on today.
BRANDY=>Hello. Who is this? What do you want from me? No please stop! I'm gonna call the police if you don't stop calling me!
BRANDY=>It was him again! He keeps harassing me, sending me notes, calling me on the phone. I'm so scared!
CINDY=>The killer?
BRANDY=>No, M.C. Hammer!
BRANDY=>Aw, shit, I hope that tramp ain't coming over here.
CINDY=>Who, Tanya?
BRANDY=>I don't like her cause she's phoney. I'm talking faker than a swap meet hair weave.
BRANDY=>What's happenin'? Girl, I ain't seen you in ages.
TANYA=>Right, since the video. Listen, I just wanted to know if you guys were coming to the pageant tonight.
BRANDY=>Aw, I can't. I gotta study.
TANYA=>Cind?
BUFFY=>She's going to cheer for me.
TANYA=>Oh, I see. Well, whatever. Good luck, Buff.
BUFFY=>Slut.
TANYA=>Ho.
CINDY=>The police asked me a whole lot of questions.
BRANDY=>Yeah, my brother Shorty is still in there.
SHORTY=>Yo, yo , what's up?
RAY=>How'd it go with the police?
SHORTY=>They tried to intimidate a brother but I told them I don't talk to pigs and I ain't dropping dime on nobody. I just told them where they could shove it.
BOBBY=>They asked me if I knew how to hunt.
BUFFY=>That's funny, they asked me if I like it doggie style.
CINDY=>It's a shame how she died. She was such a nice girl.
BUFFY=>You know she used to babysit my brother Doofy. He had the biggest crush on her.
SHORTY=>Hey, didn't Greg used to go out with her?
BUFFY=>What are you saying? Greg killed her?
SHORTY=>No, but it makes him a suspect.
BUFFY=>Oh, yeah, where were you last night?
SHORTY=>I was chillin' at the crib watching an ill kung fu flick called Tae Bo. There was this ugly ass brother and he looked like a burnt up Keenen Ivory Wayans but the
SHORTY=>What did you do last night?
BUFFY=>I was in bed all night.
SHORTY=>Can you prove it?
BUFFY=>Sure I can, right guys?
BUFFY=>Here comes Greg. Now let's see what he thinks of your suspect theory.
GREG=>Ray, you're a dead man!
BOBBY=>Easy Greg. What's the problem?
GREG=>I'll tell you the problem!
BOBBY=>Oh, wow! This is you? Oh fuck!
GREG=>Hey, the shower was cold!
BRANDY=>Let me see.
BRANDY=>My God, how do you even give him head?
BUFFY=>I don't. I just use it to pick my teeth.
GREG=>My nuts are big, they just make my dick look small.
CHINESE GUY=>Now that's a little dick.
GREG=>It's a Polaroid! There's no dimension!
GREG=>All of you can go to hell!
CINDY=>Greg, you're not the only one who got one.
GREG=>Bobby's got a baby dick too?
CINDY=>No, I was talking about the note.
CINDY=>Somebody knows.
GREG=>Bullshit. Somebody's just trying to fuck with us.
CINDY=>I think we should go to the police.
GREG=>You talk and I'll kill you myself.
BOBBY=>Greg, chill, you're hurting her.
SHORTY=>Somebody want to tell me what that was all about?
CINDY=>Forget it, Shorty. You've already heard too much.
M.C.=>And now for our finalists. Aren't they beautiful, except for that motley looking one? Hot damn, where's the muzzle?
M.C.=>This is the swimsuit portion of the show, giving our judges one final look at the contestants.
GREG=>Whoa! That's my girl!
CINDY=>Hey, I'm gonna go downstairs so I can get a closer seat. I'll see you guys when it's over.
BOBBY=>Hey man, I'm gonna run to the head real quick. Want me to bring you back anything?
GREG=>Nah, I'm cool. Just hurry back.
BOBBY=>Don't worry, I'll be back.
M.C.=>And now for the question in the spirit of Mother Theresa. What will be your contribution to society contestant #1?
TANYA=>I will heal the sick, feed the poor, and never change my dress.
MISS THANG=>Like Martin Luther King once said, "Can't we all just get along?"
BUFFY=>I thought we discussed this last night in your hotel room. You said if I�
M.C.=>Let's go to the talent portion of the show. Let's welcome contestant #3, Buffy Gilmore.
M.C.=>Okay, Buffy, tell us what is your talent this evening?
BUFFY=>Acting. I'll be doing a dramatic reading.
GREG=>Yeah, baby, yeah!
M.C.=>Miss Buffy Gilmore doing a dramatic reading.
BUFFY=>Look out Greg! Look behind you! It's him! It's the killer!
BUFFY=>Oh my God! Somebody do something! He's killing him!
BUFFY=>You fucking bastards! Why won't anyone help?! Someone call an ambulance! Greg hold on!
TANYA=>You have to go back on stage!
BUFFY=>I have to get to Greg.
TANYA=>But you won! They're calling your name.
BUFFY=>I won?
CINDY=>Buffy, what happened? What about Greg?
BUFFY=>Fuck Greg! I won!
TANYA=>Congratulations.
BUFFY=>Outta my way, loser.

BUFFY=>I guess you blew the wrong judge.
MISS THANG=>I'm so happy for you.
BUFFY=>No you're not.
M.C.=>There she is, Miss Teen 99�
BOBBY=>There's no sign of him anywhere.
CINDY=>He could have taken the body.
BOBBY=>Impossible. There's no blood. Nothing.
BUFFY=>It's probably Greg pulling one of his dumb jokes. I'm sure he'll turn up. He's probably at my house waiting for me!
BOBBY=>Well, I'm gonna look around some more.
CINDY=>No problem. Call me later. Be careful.
BOBBY=>Don't worry. I will.
CINDY=>Hello?
V.O.=>Hello Cindy.
CINDY=>Who is this?
V.O.=>It's me, Bobby. You know, your boyfriend?
CINDY=>Sorry, guess I'm just a little jumpy. Any sign of Greg?
V.O. BOBBY=>No. Do you want me to come by?

DOOFY=>I'll give you a ride.
GAIL=>Kenny! Camera! Now!
GAIL=>Who is that? Is he a suspect? Is anyone dead? Sheriff, can I get a statement?
BOBBY=>Cindy! Come on Cind! You know me!
SHERIFF=>How's she doing?
SHERIFF=>Okay, I'll take it from here.
SHERIFF=>I know you've had a rough night Cindy, so I'm not going to keep you. I just want you to look at some photo's and tell me what you think.
SHERIFF=>Okay, you're free to go. Do you have someone picking you up?
CINDY=>Yes.
DOOFY=>Yes.
DOOFY=>What's that?
DOOFY=>Hey, smell my finger.
DOOFY=>My ass.
BUFFY=>Doofy, mom said get home now.
DOOFY=>Tell mom I'm on official police business.
BUFFY=>Hey, Cind, you okay?
DOOFY=>Hey, no talking to the witness.
BUFFY=>Go get in the car Doofy. She's coming with us.
DOOFY=>Does mom know?
BUFFY=>Yeah, Doofus.
DOOFY=>Mom says when I wear this badge your supposed to treat me like a man of the law.
BUFFY=>Yeah, well mom also said for you to stop sticking your dick in the vacuum cleaner. Now let's go.
GAIL=>Okay roll in 5, 4, 3�
GAIL=>What now? Don't tell me you can't count. Let's see if I can make it easy for you. This little piggy went to market, this little
KENNY=>We're live.
GAIL=>Hi, Gail Hailstorm here in front of the police station where I'm going to try to get a glimpse of Cindy Campbell, the young woman who was attacked earlier this evening.
GAIL=>Cindy, your ass looks fat.
BUFFY=>Do you really think Bobby did it?
CINDY=>I don't know but he was there.
BUFFY=>I knew there had to be something.
DOOFY=>Here, a little something for your hand.
DOOFY=>Sorry. I better get something for your head.
CINDY=>That's okay Doofy.
DOOFY=>I'll be in the next room if you need me.
CINDY=>Thanks. Good night Doofy.
CINDY=>Say, I didn't know you ate stuff like that.
BUFFY=>Oh, I'm on this new diet. I can eat all the junk food I want and not gain a pound!
CINDY=>Really?!
MRS. GILMORE=>Cindy, telephone.
CINDY=>Who is it?
MRS. GILMORE=>I'm just guessing but I'd say a psychotic killer.
CINDY=>Hello?
V.O. KILLER=>Hello, Cindy. Poor Bobby boy. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
CINDY=>No!
MRS. GILMORE=>Doofy! Doofy!
CINDY=>Who are you?
V.O. KILLER=>You'll find out soon enough.
DOOFY=>What?
DOOFY=>Hello?
MUSH=>ON TO THE PLATES. EACH WORKER GETS PROGRESSIVELY UGLIER.
THE=>LAST IS A SEA CREATURE IN A UNIFORM AND HAIR NET.
CINDY=>Hey guys.
BRANDY=>How you doin' girl?
CINDY=>Ok. He got Buffy.
SHORTY=>What?! She's dead too?
CINDY=>No, she's fine, just a little bent out of shape.
RAY=>We gotta get this guy.
CINDY=>I think we should all just stick together. After school, everyone grab some stuff, meet at my house and invite some friends too. There is safety in numbers. Anyone seen Bobby?
RAY=>I heard he was let out this morning.
CINDY=>If you see him, tell him I'm sorry. I'll see you guys tonight.
CINDY=>Why are they doing this?
CINDY=>Oh my�
BOBBY=>It's okay. It's just me.
BOBBY=>Whoa, whoa, wait. You don't still think it's me?!
CINDY=>No, no, not at all. It's just that someone did try to kill me.
BOBBY=>The police said I scared him away.
CINDY=>I know. He called last night.
BOBBY=>See? It couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
BOBBY=>What? My girl would rather call me a killer then touch me?
CINDY=>That's not true.
BOBBY=>Then what is it?
CINDY=>What is it? Bobby, she's gone and she's not coming back.
BOBBY=>It's been a year Cindy.
CINDY=>But Ginger was such an important part of the Spice Girls.
BOBBY=>You have to move on, Cind.
CINDY=>I'm sorry if my complicated life is an inconvenience to your perfect existence.
BOBBY=>Stupid.
SHERIFF=>Let me just say the killings of these teenagers have been tragic but with every cloud there is a silver lining. Thanks to all the press, tourism is at an all time high. Any of you folks visiting, I'll be selling souvenir t-shirts right after the conference.
SHERIFF=>Only fifteen bucks each. Get one for the whole family.
GAIL=>Sheriff..Hi, Gail Hailstorm, author of 101 Ways to Milk a Tragedy. Sheriff, let me ask you, do you think the killer will strike again?
SHERIFF=>We have no evidence of that. This is just a precaution.
GAIL=>Have you located Cindy Campbell's father?
SHERIFF=>No.
GAIL=>Is he a suspect?
SHERIFF=>That's classified. Where are you getting your information?
GAIL=>My source is strictly confidential.
DOOFY=>Hey, anybody wanna smell my finger?
BUFFY=>Can you believe it? There's a killer out there.
BUFFY=>I don't believe her.
BUFFY=>I think she's just trying to get attention. Just a case of virginal delusions.
BUFFY=>That Tammy. She's been left back so many times it ain't funny.
BUFFY=>Watch this.
BUFFY=>Hello, who is this? What? You want to kill me? Hold on� Cindy, it's for you.
MISS MANN=>Alright, knock it off Buffy. Now as all have heard, there is a killer in our town and the police have asked us to give you all the following safety tips. Stay in well lit areas, do not travel alone whenever possible and don't accept rides from anyone you don't know. I understand this is a difficult time for you young ladies, so if anyone wants to come to my office to talk, I'm here for you.
BUFFY=>What a crock of shit.
CINDY=>It's not! He's out there! I'm telling you he's real!
BUFFY=>Oh right, cause you saw him. Sure. What are you gonna come up with next? Let me guess..The faculty are really aliens?
CINDY=>Miss Mann?
MISS MANN=>Come right in, dear. Have a seat. Take off your bra if you like.
MISS MANN=>What can I do for you dear?
CINDY=>I need to talk.
MISS MANN=>Go ahead, my dear.
CINDY=>Well, you see, I have this problem and I don't know who to tell. This is really hard.
MISS MANN=>Not feeling so fresh?
CINDY=>Huh?
MISS MANN=>Feminine odor and itching got you down?
CINDY=>No, not that.
MISS MANN=>Oh.
MISS MANN=>I see. Well, Cindy, we all have our little secrets.
MISS MANN=>Sometimes we do things we're not proud of.
MISS MANN=>Some for money, others to gain an athletic edge against the competition.
MISS MANN=>Sometimes those little secrets come back to haunt us in the most unpredictable ways. You know what I mean?
CINDY=>Yes I do. Thanks for your time. I gotta go to class.
MISS MANN=>Anytime, dear.
BUFFY=>Very funny. But you better get out of here before Miss Mann sees you.
BUFFY=>Oh, so what movie is this from, "Die Cheerleaders Die"? So wanna play psycho killer?
BUFFY=>Can I be the helpless cheerleader? Let's see� Please don't kill me, mister killer�
BUFFY=>Oh, is this the part where I beg for my life?
BUFFY=>Oh, please mister killer, don't kill me!
BUFFY=>Oh is this where I'm supposed to bleed? Oh, look, I'm bleeding. EEK! EEK! Oh yeah, I'm supposed to run, right? Ha ha, okay, if it makes you happy.
BUFFY=>I'm running, I'm running. Help! Now here is where I fall and break my leg, leaving me helpless.
BUFFY=>There ya go, mister scary killer. I'm panicking now. God, somebody please help me!
BUFFY=>So, I suppose this is where my guts get ripped open? Whatever�
BUFFY=>Oh, look at me. I'm all dead.
BUFFY=>I'm a gross scary severed head. Come on, Pul-leeze!
FACULTY MEMBER=>Phil! What are you doing?! Come back in here!
PHIL=>No, I've had it! I can't take this job and these stupid kids
FACULTY MEMBER=>Be reasonable.
PHIL=>There's nothing for me to live for. I'm jumping.
FACULTY MEMBER=>Wait! Just hold on, we're getting help.
BRANDY=>The killer's just fucking with us.
RAY=>I don't get it. Why?
CINDY=>What does he want with us?
CINDY=>What are you waiting for, huh?
CINDY=>What are you waiting for?!
PHIL=>She's right. What am I waiting for?
SHORTY=>Yo, kid. You got that ill chronic. I told you that shit would make you fly.
BRANDY=>Ray, I don't think this party is a good idea. What if Shorty is right?
RAY=>Promise.
SONG V.O.=>Every where I go, I see the same ho, in every video, I see the same hooo�
BRANDY=>Hey, that's my song. You know they gave me a shout out on the album.
RAY=>You know, you look really sexy in my jersey.
BRANDY=>You think so?
RAY=>Yeah, put these on with it.
RAY=>And these too.
RAY=>Yeah, and this too.
RAY=>Yeah, that's hot. Wait. One more thing.
RAY=>That's what I'm talkin' about. Come here, you sexy thing you.
BRANDY=>I don't know why we got to go see this movie. They just insult my intelligence.
RAY=>What are you talking about? You just got your GED.
BRANDY=>All I know is these movies is about white people doing white things in white places. There ain't never no black people in them.
RAY=>That's cuz it's Shakespeare.
BRANDY=>Whatever. Why can't we go see a horror movie or something?
RAY=>Look, why don't you just chill
BRANDY=>Alright. I'm sorry. I do appreciate you takin' me out.
RAY=>Look, why don't you go get some seats? I'm gonna get some refreshments.
BRANDY=>Ray! Hey Ray-Ray! Down here!
RAY=>You want some popcorn?
BRANDY=>I brought my own food.
BRANDY=>Ooo, yeah, do that shit!
BRANDY=>This sound system is the bomb. I need one of these in my car.
RAY=>Watch my seat. I have to go to the bathroom.
LITTLE PERSON=>Hey, I'm in here.
RAY=>My bad.
BRANDY=>Don't go in there!
BRANDY=>This is some scary shit! Run, Shakespeare, run!
MAN=>Will you keep it down!?
BRANDY=>Excuse me! I paid my money like everyone else.
BRANDY=>That ain't no man!
BRANDY=>You can see her real hair under that wig. Look right there!
WOMAN=>Do you mind?
BRANDY=>Hey Ray, you came back just in time. Yeah, this movie is good.
BRANDY=>She's about to get it on with Shake-a-spear; he found out she's a girl. This is just like an episode of Jerry Springer.
BRANDY=>Aw, shit. The fightin'! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
OLD LADY=>Shut up!
MAN=>For Christ's sake, shut your trap!
BRANDY=>I don't know why y'all trippin'. My girlfriend saw the movie and she said they don't even stay together in the end.
SHORTY=>Here it comes..SPLAT!
JILL=>How can you watch this over and
SHORTY=>It's great promotion for Miramax.
TEEN=>When does LL get killed?
SHORTY=>He doesn't. LL Cool J is one of the only black guys to survive a horror movie. Him and Duane Martin from Scream 2. That's because they followed the rules.
JILL=>What are you talking about?
SHORTY=>There are certain rules a black person must follow in order to survive a horror movie.
JILL=>Where's Brandy?
SHORTY=>Probably dead. The sassy black best friend of a white virgin is always sacrificed first. It's like being the black guy with the red shirt in the Star Trek landing party when Kirk says "Johnson, go check it out". You know he ain't coming back.
JILL=>I'm going to the kitchen. Anybody want anything?
TEEN=>More popcorn.
JILL=>Can I help with anything?
CINDY=>Sure, can you get some more beers out of the fridge in the garage?
JILL=>Sure.
JILL=>Oh, kitty, you scared me.
JILL=>Oh horsey! You scared me too!
JILL=>Who's there? Hello? Is anyone there?
JILL=>Oh my God! Please don't! I'm just a day player!
TEENS=>Go! Go! Go! Go!
TEEN BOY=>Whoa!
BOBBY=>Somebody looking for me?
CINDY=>Hi. You had me worried there for a minute. I thought the killer got to you before I could.
BOBBY=>Could what?
CINDY=>Why don't we go ahead upstairs and whatever�
CINDY=>So�.
BOBBY=>So, here we are again.
CINDY=>Yeah.
BOBBY=>And if your not ready still, I'll understand.
CINDY=>But I am ready.
BOBBY=>You are?
CINDY=>Yeah, I figured out that I have to live my own life and I can't keep fighting my urges. I have to give in and let them flow.
BOBBY=>This is like a scene in a movie.
CINDY=>Only this is real life, it's not a movie.
BOBBY=>Sure it is..There's the sound man and the script supervisor..
CINDY=>What I mean is in real life you have to enjoy each moment.
CINDY=>You know, I've never really done this before.
BOBBY=>It's okay. It's just like sucking a tootsie pop.
BOBBY=>That's it, that's right. Just like that.
CINDY=>I never could wait to get to the chewy middle.
BOBBY=>Come here, let me.
CINDY=>Here, let me.
CINDY=>To the left! Faster! Higher! Wait!
CINDY=>I want sex.
BOBBY=>Okay, let me just get my pants off.
BOBBY=>Are you sure?
CINDY=>I want it now!
BOBBY=>Oh my God! I can't hold it..OOOOO!!!
TEEN=>Dude, where did you get this? It's fuckin' awesome
KILLER=>Good shit.
TEEN=>Fuckin' a dude, I'm wasted.
KILLER=>You hear that?
KILLER=>Ching, ching, ching, ching, cha, cha, cha, cha. I'm just bullshitting. Hey you guys want to have some fun?
KILLER=>What's your favorite scary movie?
TEEN=>Who was the killer in Friday the Thirteenth?
CINDY=>That was wonderful. I really felt something special happen between us. Like this bond that can only be between two people who truly love one another, you know?
BOBBY=>Yeah, I got that ass. Tore it up!
CINDY=>Bobby! Did you hear anything I said?
BOBBY=>Yeah, sure, can you make me a sandwich? I'm a little hungry.
SHORTY=>Hello? What? No way!
SHORTY=>Hey everybody, they found Tanya hanging from the goal post.
CINDY=>Bobby, where were you tonight?
BOBBY=>Huh?
CINDY=>I was just curious. What took you so long to get here?
BOBBY=>Why so curious?
CINDY=>Well, I just thought it would fit the 90's horror clich� if you turn out to be the killer.
BOBBY=>You think I killed Buffy and Greg?
CINDY=>Buffy and Greg are dead?
CINDY=>Bobby! Look out! He's behind you!
CINDY=>Oh my God! Bobby no!!!
CINDY=>Ray! I'm so glad you're okay! The killer is here! He got Bobby! We gotta get away!
BOBBY=>Cindy! Help!
CINDY=>Bobby!!!
CINDY=>Ray, what are you doing?
CINDY=>What?!
BOBBY=>We all go a little crazy sometimes. Billy Loomis, Scream part 1.
CINDY=>No, it can't be!
BOBBY=>Yes Cindy, it's true.
CINDY=>But I thought you loved me.
BOBBY=>Oh I did, but abstinence will make you discover new things about yourself. That's right, Cindy, I'm gay and if you haven't noticed, so is Ray.
RAY=>Huh? Wait, whoa! I'm not gay.
BOBBY=>What do you mean? You took me to the club.
RAY=>They play good music.
BOBBY=>What about our trip to San Francisco?
RAY=>I wanted to do some shopping!
BOBBY=>But you made love to me!
RAY=>Hey, you sucked my di..
BOBBY=>Whatever! The point is I'm a new man. I'm ready to leave all of this behind and start a new life.
CINDY=>So you kill all your friends.
BOBBY=>No, just you. See, that's the genius of it all, the perfect crime, copycat of a serial killer.
RAY=>But there's more! Hold on cause this is a scream baby!
CINDY=>Dad! Oh my God! So what are you gonna do, frame him?
RAY=>No, we were just having a little fun with him.
BOBBY=>No, the police will find you both dead and me and Ray are the only survivors of a maniac's revenge. Okay Ray, let's do it.
BOBBY=>Come on baby, get it!!!
BOBBY=>Ok, ok, that's enough.
RAY=>My bad.
BOBBY=>Ok, my turn.
RAY=>What?
BOBBY=>Give me the knife! It's my turn to stab you.
RAY=>Shit, you must be crazy! Ain't nobody stabbing me!
CINDY=>I'm not running anymore, no more victim. Come on, show me what you got.
CINDY=>No!
SHERIFF=>What the hell is going on here?
DEPUTY=>It's a blood bath in there, sir.
CINDY=>He was right here, I swear!
CINDY=>The killer.
SHERIFF=>I'm gonna have to take you in.
SHERIFF=>Let's go over this again. You say it was an accident?
CINDY=>Yes, he was on the road.
SHERIFF=>And you think he came back to get revenge?
CINDY=>Yes, it had to be him.
DOOFY=>They told me to give you this.
SHERIFF=>Thanks, shit head.
DOOFY=>You ok Cindy?
CINDY=>Yes, thanks Doofy.
SHERIFF=>That will be all Doofy.
SHERIFF=>Sorry, Cindy, it wasn't the guy you hit. His name was David Keegan. Some fisherman found his body a few weeks
CINDY=>That's impossible.
SHERIFF=>Afraid not.
CINDY=>Who could it be?
SHERIFF=>Had to be someone who was connected to all the victims. Someone who knew about the accident. Someone who could move around without being noticed.
CINDY=>Oh my God!
BUFFY=>Doofy had the biggest crush on her.
DOOFY=>I'll be in the next room.
CINDY=>Doofy!
SHERIFF=>Anyone seen Doofy?
GAIL=>This is gonna make one helluva movie.
