ALAN TURING=>This will go quite fast now.
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>How ever could I have guessed?
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>And how old were you when you published this paper here, that has a title I can barely understand, which apparently got you this fellowship?
ALAN TURING=>Oh, I don’t, really.
ALAN TURING=>I don’t speak German.
ALAN TURING=>I don’t. Speak German.
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>Have a pleasant trip back to Cambridge, Professor.
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>Enigma isn’t difficult. It’s impossible. The Americans. The French. The Russians. The Germans. Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>This is Stuart Menzies. MI-6.
HUGH ALEXANDER=>Alright boys. Let’s play.
ALAN TURING=>Do you know why people like violence? Because it feels good.
ALAN TURING=>Humans find violence deeply satisfying. But remove the satisfaction, and the act becomes... Hollow.
CHRISTOPHER=>They’re getting worse.
DETECTIVE NOCK=>Has been for awhile now.
ALAN TURING=>The trick was that they were encrypted.
PETER HILTON=>Who’s hungry? Let’s go.
ALAN TURING=>This is unacceptable.
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>Your fellow codebreakers are refusing to work with you. They’ve filed a formal complaint.
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>Winston Churchill. 10 Downing Street, London. You have a problem with my decision you can take it up with him.
ALAN TURING=>He just said I could.
JOHN CAIRNCROSS=>... So what do we do now?
YOUNG ALAN=>What’s cryptography?
YOUNG ALAN=>Like secret messages?
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH=>It’s an empty manila envelope.
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH=>And that person broke into his house and stole... Nothing?
ALAN TURING=>My machine will work.
ALAN TURING=>I’m not a Soviet spy.
HUGH ALEXANDER=>Do love a proper blonde.
HUGH ALEXANDER=>Fine, Alan can come too.
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>Turing! Open the bloody door!
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>Have you decrypted any German messages? A single one? Can you point to anything at all that you’ve achieved?
COMMANDER DENNISTON=>What on earth are you saying?
SERGEANT STAEHL=>He’s a bloody poofter. He confessed.
ALAN TURING=>I like talking to you.
JOAN CLARKE=>You have one in mind?
ALAN TURING=>This is your parents.
DETECTIVE NOCK=>What makes you say that?
ALAN TURING=>“The Imitation Game.”
HELEN=>So my type then?
JOHN CAIRNCROSS=>— So we’ll use the loops?
JOAN CLARKE=>And they’ll have the design of Enigma changed by the weekend.
ALAN TURING=>It was like having a tap on Himmler’s intercom.
JOHN CAIRNCROSS=>... The Soviets and us, we’re all on the same side. What I’m doing will help Britain.
JOHN CAIRNCROSS=>Until the history books are ready to call you a hero, sometimes you have to play the villain.
STEWART MENZIES=>You said yourself he was a piss- poor mathematician.
STEWART MENZIES=>Even information that will help them against the Germans. So much secrecy...
JOAN CLARKE=>Alan. What’s happened?
ALAN TURING=>Men, Joan. Not women.
YOUNG ALAN=>I wouldn’t say that.
HEADMASTER=>Christopher is dead.
ALAN TURING=>Well how would I even have got parts in jail? It just makes no sense.
