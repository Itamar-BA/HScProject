TOLLER=>Mary, what is it?

TOLLER=>It’s hard to imagine.
TOLLER=>It doesn’t help.
MICHAEL=>Yes. It’s a plan.
TOLLER=>Despair is a development of pride so great that it chooses one’s certitude rather than admit God is more creative than we are. Perhaps it’s better I didn’t say that to him.

JEFFERS=>No, we thank you.
ESTHER=>How was Jeffers?
TOLLER=>Is Michael there?
TOLLER=>Can I come along?

TOLLER=>He’s a good man.
TOLLER=>What God wants--
TOLLER=>You’ll relocate there?
