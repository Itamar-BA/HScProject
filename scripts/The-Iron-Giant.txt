FIRST MATE=>Mayday! Mayday! This is fishing ship "Annabelle"! We're floundering and taking on water! Mayday! Mayday!
CAPTAIN=>What's our position?
CAPTAIN=>If you don't know where we are then you don't know where we're going!! You could be running us right into the rocks!!
RADIO=>Coast Guard Portland Station to Annabelle: Do you read me?
CAPTAIN=>It's not over, you idiots! It's just the eye of the storm!
FISHERMAN=>Look!
CAPTAIN=>The lighthouse! Head for it!
VOICE=>Hogarth....?!!
ANNIE=>Are you alright, honey?
HOGARTH=>Yeah, Mom, I'm okay...
HOGARTH=>... are you?
ANNIE=>I hate when the power goes out. But... yes, I'm fine.
HOGARTH=>Wanna stay up with me for a while? I could tell you a story...
ANNIE=>A story, huh? What have you got for me this time?
HOGARTH=>Well, it's a story about...
HOGARTH=>Mickey Mantle. He had a magic bat, Mom. Everybody says so.
HOGARTH=>Anyway, this is the story of Mickey's
ANNIE=>You've got a lot going on in there, don't you, Hogarth? Just like your father...
HOGARTH=>I can't wait 'til he comes back.
ANNIE=>We've been through this before, honey...
HOGARTH=>They found his plane, mom. They didn't find him. He's gonna come back.
ANNIE=>So what could he do with that magic bat of his?
HOGARTH=>Huh?
ANNIE=>Mickey Mantle. Could he cast spells with it, like a magician?
HOGARTH=>Oh... Yeah. Yeah that's exactly what he could do. And that's why he was known as the Wizard of Sherwood Forest.
ANNIE=>Sherwood Forest, huh?
HOGARTH=>Right. And then one day, this Stegosaurus shows up. And he says--
ANNIE=>And this is all true, now?
HOGARTH=>Every word, Mom -- I wouldn't make this up. So Mickey says, "I'm the two time American League batting champ. I was MVP of the All-Star game three times running. I go anywhere I please in this forest..."
FIRST LOCAL=>Strangest storm I ever seen. Swept away my best iron wheelbarrow. But left the handles behind...
FIRST WOMAN=>My husband spoke to one of those fishermen this morning. Fellow wouldn't talk about the shipwreck at all. Said we'd all think he was mad.
SECOND WOMAN=>Now what do you think he meant by that?
FIRST WOMAN=>Well, I'm sure I don't know. But it wouldn't surprise me if the communists are involved.
HOGARTH=>Remember -- be charming.
HOGARTH=>Hey, Mom! You won't believe our good luck! Look what I found...
HOGARTH=>His tree musta gotten knocked down in the storm! Can I keep him?
ANNIE=>Hogarth, we've been through this. No pets...
HOGARTH=>But he's not a pet, Mom. He's a friend. You're always saying I should have more friends come over, right? Well now I've got one. You gotta admit I'm making sense here.
ANNIE=>Hogarth, if there's one thing we've learned from your many pets, it's that claws and furniture do not mix.
HOGARTH=>I know but--
ANNIE=>No "buts." We have got to rent a room this year if we're going to make ends meet...
HOGARTH=>You'll never know he's there. I'll keep him in a cage--
ANNIE=>-until you feel sorry for him and "set him free" in the house. Remember the raccoon, Hogarth? God, I remember the raccoon...
HOGARTH=>Please, mom. At least look at him...
ANNIE=>Alright, where is this guy...?
HOGARTH=>I... will go get him... okay?
HOGARTH=>Excuse me...? Excuse me...
HOGARTH=>Sir?
HOGARTH=>Sir...? Sir? Sir! EXCUSE ME, S--
DEAN=>I was snoring, right? Sorry, man. I'm just not a morning person...
HOGARTH=>Please don't move, sir. My pet's under your table--don't look--if you make a scene my mom won't let me keep him.
DEAN=>Don't worry sonny, I'm cool as a cucumb-
DEAN=>Had a little cigarette mishap. It's under control. Show's over. Cool yourselves and resume breakfasting, people. What kind of pet, kid?
HOGARTH=>A squirrel. Don't worry, he's friendly.
ANNIE=>Is my son bothering you, sir?
DEAN=>Yes. No. Call me Dean.
FIRST BUSYBODY=>Oh! I don't know why they let such people in here.
SECOND BUSYBODY=>She ought to ignore him.
THIRD BUSYBODY=>You forget how single she is, dear.
ANNIE=>Hogarth. I thought you were getting your pet, honey.
HOGARTH=>I will, mom. After I finish talking to-
DEAN=>Dean.
HOGARTH=>--Dean.
DEAN=>I found your pet.
HOGARTH=>Where?
DEAN=>Up my leg, man. Squirrel's in my pants, Hogarth. I'm tryin' not to wig out here.
HOGARTH=>Don't wig out.
DEAN=>Okay... he's heading north. I'm sorry, kid...
DEAN=>I'd like to apologize to everyone in advance for this.
DEAN=>Check, please.
KENT=>And did you see any strange lights in the sky last night? Any saucer-shaped flying objects?
FARMER=>No...
KENT=>Were any of your live stock disoriented this morning? Did your cows appear anxious or depressed?
FARMER=>No... ...who did you say you worked for again?
KENT=>Frankly I'm not at liberty to reveal the particulars of the agency I work for.
KENT=>But between you and me, I represent the United States Government. U.P.D. The Unexplained Phenomena Department.
FARMER=>C.I.A.?
KENT=>Huh? Oh, uh... no. Our scope is less limited than the CIA. Unexplained Phenomena, my friend -- that could be anything.
FARMER=>You work out of the Pentagon, then?
KENT=>Well, sure, we work near the Pentagon, yes. You know Radcliffe Street?
FARMER=>No.
KENT=>Well, trust me, it's pretty much Pentagon adjacent. And all that that implies.
FARMER=>So, what do you think got to my tractor? Something the commies built? Some kind of monster? Something from outer space?
KENT=>No, it's probably something else. It's always something else.
HOGARTH=>Hello this is Hogarth Hughes speaking who's calling please.
ANNIE=>Hogarth, honey... I'm really sorry, but I need to work late tonight. There's some cold chicken in the ice box. You can have that and some carrots--
HOGARTH=>I'm already on it, Mom.
ANNIE=>Good. I'll make it up to you, okay?
HOGARTH=>Okay.
ANNIE=>I love you honey. And Hogarth? No scary movies, no late snacks, in bed by eight. Got it?
HOGARTH=>Got it.
HOGARTH=>No! Not now!
HOGARTH=>Stupid antenna...!
HOGARTH=>Gone.
HOGARTH=>Whoa...
HOGARTH=>Hogarth Hughes. Ready for action.
HOGARTH=>Wow... it eats metal. Cool.
ANNIE=>Hogarth...? Hogarth! HOGARTH!!
ANNIE=>Hogarth!
HOGARTH=>Mom!
ANNIE=>Hogarth!
HOGARTH=>I'm sorry, mom...
ANNIE=>Don't ever do that to me again, Hogarth. I was so scared, I thought I'd lost you...
HOGARTH=>Mom, you won't believe it. Some-thing ate our t.v. antenna.
ANNIE=>Oh, Hogarth...
HOGARTH=>No, I'm serious! And I went out to see what it was--
ANNIE=>Hogarth... please...
HOGARTH=>--and it was a Giant metal--
ANNIE=>HOGARTH! Stop it! I'm not in the mood. Come on. Let's go home.
TEACHER=>And who can name another country that is part of the U.S.S.R.?
TEACHER=>Anyone besides Hogarth?
TEACHER=>Anyone actually listening to me other than Hogarth? Hogarth, are we going to have to move you up another grade? Or should we move the rest of the class down? Alright, that's it. Everyone in the class except Hogarth can write me a five page essay. Call it "Allies and Enemies of the United States of America." It's due tomorrow.
FOREMAN=>Yeah, sometimes a line'll snap if the weather's bad, sure. But for a whole tower to get twisted up like that? I tell you, it's got me beat.
KENT=>And not a single witness...
FOREMAN=>'Fraid not, sir.
KENT=>Could this have been caused by a giant metal monster, perhaps?
FOREMAN=>Pardon me, sir?
KENT=>Nothing. Just repeating a yarn I heard from some fishermen...
KENT=>Excuse me.
HOGARTH=>Hey guys!
FIRST KID=>Hey, Hogarth.
HOGARTH=>Listen, you're not going to believe what happened to me last night. I went walking into the forest, and I saw this... giant!
FIRST KID=>You know what I just remembered? I'm suppose to help some people do some stuff way over in some other place right now.
SECOND KID=>Oh those people? Yeah, I'm suppose to do that too.
FIRST KID=>Nice seeing you, Hogarth.
FIRST KID=>Boy, I hope they never skip me a grade.
SECOND KID=>He's gotten really desperate.
HOGARTH=>Hellllllooo! Come ouuut!
HOGARTH=>Hey, big metal guy!! It's me, the kid who turned off the power for ya!
HOGARTH=>Metal! Delicious metal! Come and get it!
HOGARTH=>Aaaaagh!
HOGARTH=>What do you want from me?!!
HOGARTH=>The shut-off switch...
HOGARTH=>You saw me save you.
FIRST BUSYBODY=>Well, in my opinion, it's a woman's obligation to re-marry. If not for herself, than for her child.
SECOND BUSYBODY=>Do you know she left her little boy all alone last night? My son heard he went wandering around all by himself. Near the power plant...
THIRD BUSYBODY=>Tsk-tsk. On the very night those power lines came down? The poor child could have been killed.
FIRST BUSYBODY=>It just goes to prove my point. She ought to provide him with a father figure, if she cares about the boy.
ANNIE=>She does care about her boy, for your information.
KENT=>I'd love some.
KENT=>Annie. What a very lovely name...
HOGARTH=>So... what are you?
HOGARTH=>Do you talk?
HOGARTH=>Well, you get the concept, anyway. But we need to work on your vocabulary. Let's see.
HOGARTH=>See this? This is called a rock. "Rock." Try it. "Rooock."
GIANT=>Kraaan-chunk.
HOGARTH=>"Rooock."
GIANT=>Kroooonk.
HOGARTH=>Rock.
GIANT=>Rog.
HOGARTH=>Good! See? This is a... rock.
GIANT=>Rog.
GIANT=>Rog?
HOGARTH=>Yes!
GIANT=>Rog!
GIANT=>Rog... Treeee-
HOGARTH=>Get it? Everything has a different name. Rock. Tree...
HOGARTH=>Branch.
GIANT=>Braaannch.
HOGARTH=>Yeah, that's a branch, too.
GIANT=>Braaannch. Rog?
HOGARTH=>Look, we've pretty much covered everything in the forest. And if I don't get home soon, mom's gonna wonder where I am. You stay here, okay? I'll come back tomorrow.
HOGARTH=>And don't follow me, either.
HOGARTH=>I said don't. Don't follow me. Stay. Go home. I mean it!
HOGARTH=>Look. That's where I live, okay? I'm going there, and you're not, understand? So goodbye. Hey...
HOGARTH=>Hey, wait a minute--
HOGARTH=>WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!!
HOGARTH=>Now the other one... hurry!
HOGARTH=>Good enough! Come on!
HOGARTH=>No! Come on! The train's coming!
HOGARTH=>The train!
HOGARTH=>Oh no...
HOGARTH=>You're alive!
VOICE=>Hello? Is anyone out there? Are you alright?
HOGARTH=>The train Conductor. Oh, we're in trouble now...
HOGARTH=>Okay, look. I've changed my mind. You can follow me home.
HOGARTH=>You can stay here for now.
HOGARTH=>And try to keep it quiet okay? My mom's not too big on me having any pets right now. "Shhhh" -- get it?
CONDUCTOR=>Whatever we hit, it was something big. A tractor, maybe.
ENGINEER=>More like a tank, I'd say.
CONDUCTOR=>So where the heck did it go?
ANNIE=>Dinner's been on the table for twenty minutes now. Where have you been all afternoon?
HOGARTH=>I could tell you, Mom. But I really don't think you'd believe me.
ANNIE=>Somehow, I don't doubt that.
ANNIE=>Would you say grace, please?
HOGARTH=>OH MY GOD!
ANNIE=>Amen. That was... ...really unusual, Hogarth.
HOGARTH=>Gotta use the bathroom.
ANNIE=>Well... Okay.
KENT=>Hey there, Scout... Kent Mansley. I work for the government. Your parents home?
HOGARTH=>We're eating.
KENT=>What's wrong, Scout? You seem a little
ANNIE=>Who is it, Hogarth?
KENT=>Why, hello there! Annie, isn't it? From the diner?
ANNIE=>That's right! Mr. Mansley?
KENT=>Please. Call me Kent. So this is your house... ...then you must be Hobo!
HOGARTH=>Hogarth.
KENT=>Hobart.
KENT=>Yes indeed. I'm terribly sorry to bother you at this hour, but I'm looking into a little train accident that happened nearby and-- my goodness! Is there a blue- ribbon pie in the oven, or have I died and gone to Heaven?
ANNIE=>We've just sat down to dinner, Mr. Mansley. Would you care to join us?
KENT=>If it's not too much trouble, I'd be delighted!
KENT=>Here. Pretend you're a gangster.
KENT=>Well! It certainly is true what they say; the hospitality in these parts is second to none.
HOGARTH=>Which parts would those be, sir?
KENT=>Well, you know, uh... Maine.
HOGARTH=>I never heard anyone say that about Maine. Have you, Mom?
ANNIE=>Hogarth...
KENT=>Oh, it's alright. He's a bright boy. I like bright boys...
HOGARTH=>Goings-on?
KENT=>You know, the power plant being destroyed and all.
ANNIE=>Careful, Mr. Mansley... he's got a powerful imagination.
KENT=>Please. Call me Kent. I like to be on a first-name basis with first-class chefs.
HOGARTH=>If it's alright with everybody, I think I'll be excused now.
KENT=>But you haven't answered my question, Hogarth.
KENT=>The powerplant. The train. Surely you must have a theory, Hogarth. A bright boy like you. Surely you must have an inkling --
HOGARTH=>There's a monster out there!
KENT=>What???
HOGARTH=>It's a hideous creature, five stories tall, and if you go out looking for it you won't come back alive!
KENT=>You're... kidding.
ANNIE=>Of course he's kidding.
HOGARTH=>I'm a kid. That's what we do.
KENT=>Do you have a guest?
ANNIE=>No...
ANNIE=>Excuse me.
ANNIE=>Hogarth? Are you alright?
KENT=>This sort of thing is why it's so important to really chew your food...
HOGARTH=>--rrrrrgggggghhhhh!
ANNIE=>Good lord, you've been acting strange lately.
KENT=>Do you have a telephone I could use?
KENT=>--let me put it bluntly, sir. I'm onto something big in Rockwell, Maine.
CHIEF=>What is it this time, Kent?
KENT=>This time -- well, this time it's a giant, that's roaming around the town destroying things.
CHIEF=>Uh-huh. Well, you be sure to file us a report, and we'll be sure to process it.
KENT=>Excellent, sir. And in the meantime, I'd like to call in my team.
CHIEF=>Your... team?
KENT=>My backup, my support squad. Half a dozen men are all I need to start...
CHIEF=>Kent, I know this will come as a shock to you, but we can't just give a team to anyone who asks.
KENT=>Forgive my saying so, sir, but I'm not just anyone, and I've never asked. Before. Until now. Sir?
CHIEF=>You haven't really found something, have you?
KENT=>I think I have, sir, yes.
CHIEF=>You think. Do you have proof?
KENT=>Sir, I've got a feeling about this one, a gut feeling...
CHIEF=>That's lovely, Kent. But let me try to explain how this works. If you called to tell me you'd found, say, a giant footprint, I might send over an expert to make a plaster cast of it. If you saw an
KENT=>Alright then, fine. You want evidence? I'll get your evidence...
CHIEF=>That sounds swell, Kent.
KENT=>And when I do, I'm going to want a memo distributed! And I'm going to want that memo carbon copied and -- and re-distributed and --
ANNIE=>Bye, Honey! Have a good day at school.
HOGARTH=>Bye, Mom.
HOGARTH=>Ahem...
HOGARTH=>It wasn't easy to fill this wagon. So try to not to eat it all at once--
HOGARTH=>Do you have any idea what it took to find that metal??? I scoured the neighborhood! I had to ditch school! I've never done that before, I--
HOGARTH=>So... now that we've eaten, how shall we
HOGARTH=>Okay. I'll teach you more words.
HOGARTH=>That is my "home." That's where I come from . My... home...
GIANT=>
HOGARTH=>Right. Now where is... ...your home?
HOGARTH=>You mean... you don't know where you came from?
HOGARTH=>Wow. You poor guy...
HOGARTH=>I know, I know. Okay, I know a place where it's all you can eat. But not until after dark.
HOGARTH=>Let me put it this way.
HOGARTH=>"Sun."
GIANT=>"Suuughn."
HOGARTH=>When the sun goes down...
HOGARTH=>Feeding time. Get it?
HOGARTH=>Good!
HOGARTH=>You're smarter than you look, aren't you?
HOGARTH=>Never mind.
HOGARTH=>Come on. Let's go!
HOGARTH=>STOP!
HOGARTH=>Not that fast! Sheesh! Come back here!
HOGARTH=>Pick me up, OK?
HOGARTH=>Okay, now. March!
KENT=>"Evidence". I'll get your evidence...
KENT=>...somewhere...
HOGARTH=>Church. Churrrch.
GIANT=>Churrr-
HOGARTH=>Yes. People pray there. School. Can you say that? Schooool...
GIANT=>Skooo...
HOGARTH=>Schooool suuuucks...
GIANT=>Skoooo saauuugz...
HOGARTH=>Very good. And that's all you need to know about school.
KENT=>Nothing. Nothing...
KENT=>Whooooa!
HOGARTH=>And that building there is the coffee
GIANT=>Kau- shawww...
HOGARTH=>That's where my mom works. Sometimes she has to stay late, to make extra money 'cause... well, my Dad's away. You know what a "dad" is? A "father?"
GIANT=>"Fa-grrr?"
HOGARTH=>Yeah. It's like me... Only bigger.
HOGARTH=>He used to take me to baseball games. This one time, we brought binoculars, and we tried to figure out what pitch the catcher was calling! One year we want to go to every home game! I mean-- we wanted to...
HOGARTH=>Aw, what am I even talking to you for? You can't understand a word I'm saying!
HOGARTH=>Can you?
GIANT=>"Fa-grrrr."
HOGARTH=>Well, I guess it's better than talking to myself.
KENT=>God hates me...
KENT=>Damnation! Can't a guy get a break around here?!!
KENT=>Thank you. Waaagh!
HOGARTH=>That can't be good.
HOGARTH=>This is it.
HOGARTH=>All you can eat.
HOGARTH=>SHHHH!! Turn it off, turn it OFF!!!
DEAN=>Hey, I know you. Squirrel boy.
HOGARTH=>Hogarth.
DEAN=>By night known as Hogarth. Got it. Well, come inside kid. Hell, it's raining out there, isn't it?
HOGARTH=>Listen, you're not going to call my mom are you? She doesn't know I'm out. I could get in trouble.
DEAN=>Don't worry, kid. It's not my style to report a guy to the authorities.
DEAN=>Espresso for me, Bosco for you. But I thought you'd dig the little cup.
HOGARTH=>Thanks.
DEAN=>My name's Dean. I'm a nobody. And you are...?
HOGARTH=>Hogarth. I'm... kind of a nobody, too.
DEAN=>So what brings you all the way up here, Hogarth? You riding some kind of crazy inspiration?
HOGARTH=>I've been riding something alright...
DEAN=>Did you hear that???
HOGARTH=>No, wait! Stop!
DEAN=>Who's out there?!
DEAN=>--my god! RUN KID, RUN!!!!
HOGARTH=>It's OK...!
HOGARTH=>The giant isn't--let GO!
HOGARTH=>DON'T SQUASH HIM!! DO NOT SQ--
HOGARTH=>...squash.... him. Good boy. His name is Dean. We like Dean. Dean good. Put him down.
THE GIANT=>Dean.
HOGARTH=>Dean, meet a friend of mine. Dean, giant. Giant, Dean.
HOGARTH=>More coffee...?
DEAN=>So... where'd he come from?
HOGARTH=>He doesn't remember. He's like a little kid...
DEAN=>Little. Yeah. Huh.
HOGARTH=>He needs food. And shelter.
HOGARTH=>You got plenty of room here! This place is perfect!
DEAN=>Go away.
HOGARTH=>I can have him push the door down. You know I can.
DEAN=>Hogarth! I can't hide it here!
HOGARTH=>Him. Not it. Him.
DEAN=>Whatever! You don't even know where he came from! Or what the hell he is!
HOGARTH=>He's ...my friend.
DEAN=>Yeah. What am I, am I your friend? Bring some frankenbot with out of state plates over here and make me change my tune... don't like that jazz... God, I'm tired...
HOGARTH=>So! He can stay?!
DEAN=>Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know... ...figure something out....
HOGARTH=>It's okay. Go back to sleep. It was just a bad dream.
ANNIE=>You're up already?
HOGARTH=>...just making the bed....
ANNIE=>That's nice. Come downstairs. I have a surprise for you...
HOGARTH=>Kent...?
KENT=>Morning, sport. Sleep well?
HOGARTH=>Moooooooom!
ANNIE=>Isn't it wonderful, Hogarth? We finally got a border!
HOGARTH=>Oh no...
KENT=>You know, I meant to wake up bright and early this morning. But from the look of those waffles, I'm still in bed dreaming!
ANNIE=>Oh, Mr. Mansley-- -- Kent.
HOGARTH=>Uh... I'm not very hungry.
HOGARTH=>Chocolate malted, please. I've never been in here. Mom says the coffee's weak and they put meat extender
MAN BEHIND NEWSPAPER=>It ain't the diner, sparky. But it's more private.
DEAN=>So. Your friend's got quite an appetite.
HOGARTH=>Yeah. When I found him, he was trying to eat the power station.
DEAN=>So where does he come from?
HOGARTH=>He doesn't know.
DEAN=>You can talk to him???
HOGARTH=>Kinda. He can't say a lot of words yet, but he understands things pretty good.
DEAN=>I wonder if he had something to do with the meteorite that splashed down here the other day. Then again, maybe he was the meteorite...
HOGARTH=>That's what I was thinking! He came from outer space!!
DEAN=>Maybe. Or maybe he was launched into space from earth.
HOGARTH=>Hey, maybe the commies made him! You know, in one of their secret labs.
DEAN=>Or maybe we built him in one of ours. Our government has secrets, too you know.
HOGARTH=>Or maybe he comes from underground, you know? Like, he's this undiscovered
DEAN=>Maybe, kid. And then, again, maybe the monkeys evolved from us.
HOGARTH=>I wish we knew why he was here.
DEAN=>Hey, I wish I knew why I was here.
HOGARTH=>Yeah.
DEAN=>I mean if you think about it, nobody really knows where they came from, why they're here, or where they're going. We believe. We hope. But we don't know.
HOGARTH=>Right, right...
DEAN=>And some cats, that scares 'em, you know?
HOGARTH=>You're telling me.
DEAN=>They race around, play the game, chase money, chase power...
HOGARTH=>Just so they won't have to wonder what life's all about.
DEAN=>Exactly. Hey...
LAB-COAT AGENT=>It's the same fingerprint.
HOGARTH=>Hey, Dean?
DEAN=>Yeah?
HOGARTH=>What is life all about? For you, I mean.
DEAN=>For me? Well... I guess I'd like to prove there's something pure in me, you know? They say the soul is part angel and part monster. Sometimes I think life is a chance to set the angel free.
HOGARTH=>The Giant looks like a monster. But inside he's good. I can tell.
DEAN=>I hope you're right, kid. The world could use an angel that size.
HOGARTH=>You won't tell anybody about him, will you?
DEAN=>Nah. He's an outsider. I've got a soft spot for outsiders.
HOGARTH=>Moooom!
ANNIE=>So you work for the government?
KENT=>That's right.
ANNIE=>Our government?
KENT=>Of course. Annie, please, let me explain. Every once in a while things happen to people that just can't be rationalized in a conventional way. The Unexplained Phenomena Department was created to respond to the bizarre, the strange, the--well, unexplainable events that happen every day all across this great land. From the mountains to the prairies, to the oceans--
ANNIE=>Do you actually work in Washington?
KENT=>Yes indeed. Washington D.C...
KENT=>...if you're of a mind to be a mover and a shaker, it's the only place to be.
KENT=>A place where an individual with pluck and ambition can really get ahead...
KENT=>...safe in the knowledge that the vast resources of the U.S. Government are at ones disposal.
KENT=>Although we're simply inundated with calls, we limit ourselves to only the most demanding cases. It's a challenge, I won't deny it.
KENT=>I could tell you many strange stories, but unfortunately, all of them are classified.
KENT=>I hope that helps to calm some of your worries, Annie. And you, too, Hogarth. Hogarth?
KENT=>You're supposed to be watching him!
KENT=>For his own good, of course.
HOGARTH=>Open the blast doors!
HOGARTH=>We're landing... we're landing!
HOGARTH=>Only one creature could create such
HOGARTH=>Robotron...
GIANT=>Roarrrr....
HOGARTH=>No, no, no. Bigger...!
GIANT=>ROOAARRRR!!!!!
HOGARTH=>Good! Okay, Robotron... take THIS!!!
DEAN=>You're sure you weren't followed?
HOGARTH=>Yeah. It's not too hard to lose those guys.
DEAN=>Don't get cocky. Even guys in suits can learn.
HOGARTH=>Why do they want to get him, anyway? Just because he's different?
DEAN=>That's generally all it takes.
HOGARTH=>They don't even know him, and they just assume he's dangerous.
DEAN=>Yeah. I just hope they're wrong.
HOGARTH=>What do you mean?
DEAN=>Look, I saw what happened out there just now. When you drew a gun on him, he got a look in his eye...
HOGARTH=>It's not his fault! He can't help it.
DEAN=>That's what worries me. We don't know what he's capable of. On the surface he may be gentle, but on the inside he could be a killer.
HOGARTH=>Don't use that word around him!
DEAN=>Why not?
HOGARTH=>Because he cares. I can't explain it, but... he cares about what he is. He's getting so he can understand all kinds of stuff now. If he hears you use that word around him...
DEAN=>Okay, okay. I'm just saying, be careful. So... have we got a plan here? I mean, he can't stay here forever.
HOGARTH=>I know...
DEAN=>The longer he stays, the better their chance of finding him. We've got to get him out of here, Hogarth.
HOGARTH=>How? He's a little too big to smuggle out in a suitcase.
DEAN=>We could do it in pieces.
HOGARTH=>You mean take him apart?
DEAN=>You think he'd go for that? I've got a junk-truck -- I'm always hauling scrap. In half a dozen trips, we could get him to Canada. There are places in the Yukon, old mining sites, no one around, plenty of metal. He could roam the earth and live off the land... sounds pretty good, actually.
HOGARTH=>When?
DEAN=>The sooner the better. Tonight if possible.
HOGARTH=>Tonight??? But I only just met him a couple days ago! At least wait until tomorrow...
DEAN=>Alright, I guess one more day won't make a difference.
KENT=>Surprise.
HOGARTH=>Kent. What are you doing in my room?
KENT=>Just being friendly. And all that that implies. I know how you kids like rocky roll, so-
HOGARTH=>Pat Boone...?
KENT=>Yeah, baby. It's got that jungle rhythm, but you can understand the words...
HOGARTH=>Uh.... thanks.
KENT=>Come on, Hogarth. Let's do the happy monkey. You know the one I mean...
HOGARTH=>I don't know what you're talking about...
KENT=>You don't. Well, let me tell you a little story. Your mom says you like 'em.
KENT=>Once there was a boy who walked into a forest. He wanted to take a picture of a metal-eating giant -- but lo and behold, the giant ate his camera alllll up!!
HOGARTH=>How did you -- ?
KENT=>Because in the process, the Giant snapped a picture of himself. And the little boy brought the film home.
HOGARTH=>Give it back!
HOGARTH=>Empty...
KENT=>The Army arrives in twenty-four hours, Hogarth. Just thought you'd like to know.
KENT=>Well, isn't this a fine way to spend an evening? We're like one big happy family...
HOGARTH=>You're not family. And when my Dad finds out you sat in his chair, he'll hunt you down like a dog--
ANNIE=>Hogarth!
KENT=>I'm sorry, should I...?
ANNIE=>No, no, don't get up. My husband -- Hogarth's father -- he's... he was an Air Force Pilot in Korea. A casualty.
HOGARTH=>He's coming back.
KENT=>I'm so sorry.
HOGARTH=>No you're not!
ANNIE=>Hogarth!
HOGARTH=>But, Mom, this guy doesn't care about anything -- cats like him race around, play the game, chase money, chase power...but he keeps buttering you up so you won't see that!
ANNIE=>Hogarth, that is enough! I think you owe our guest an apology.
KENT=>Oh, now, there's no need for that. Hogarth is right in a way. I'm certainly ambitious. Yes... Ambitious, career-minded, stable --
HOGARTH=>He's doing it again!
KENT=>Hogarth. I would have thought a good American boy like yourself would have more respect for the work I do. The world has become a dangerous place, you know. The balance of power is delicate. I gather information. And the side that has the information is the side that will win.
HOGARTH=>They say the soul is part angel and part monster. One look at you and I know the monster is gonna win.
ANNIE=>That's it. You either apologize or go right up to bed right now!
ANNIE=>Honestly, I don't know where he's getting these wild ideas. He's starting to talk like that beatnik...
KENT=>Beatnik...?
ANNIE=>Have you been out at the junkyard, Hogarth?
HOGARTH=>Which junkyard?
ANNIE=>The only junkyard. Dean's junkyard.
HOGARTH=>If I had ...would you be mad at me?
ANNIE=>No... ...no. Tell him "hi" for me.
GENERAL=>Hills, valleys, woods, ravines. Lot of places to hide, around here.
KENT=>Yes, it's remarkable isn't it, sir?
KENT=>That one man, working alone, could have single-handedly found a monster in a place like this?
GENERAL=>Hard to know where to start, really...
KENT=>Well, sir, perhaps I can be of some help in that regard. You see, I've had my eye on an odd little boy who seems to be connected to the creature in question. And I have reason to believe he's been spending some time at a local scarpyard.
GENERAL=>Can you take me there?
KENT=>But of course, sir. When a five-star general needs my help, I'm only too eager to oblige.
ANNIE=>I'm the mother of that "odd" little boy.
KENT=>Oh yes, ahem.
ANNIE=>And if you're going up to the junkyard, I'm coming along.
DEAN=>Come in.
DEAN=>I assume you're here for the Lenny Bruce albums.
KENT=>Watch the wise cracks, Beatnik. We represent America.
DEAN=>We all represent America, man.
GENERAL=>Sir, my name is General Shannon Rogard. We have reason to believe you are harboring a large... ... creature whose interest run counter to those of the United States. Do you deny it?
DEAN=>Hey, man, if a cat needs to flop, my pad springs eternal.
SOLDIER=>As I understand it, sir, a "cat" is a member of the counter-culture.
GENERAL=>What rank?
SOLDIER=>Well...
ANNIE=>Is Hogarth here? Is he alright? These people say he may be in some kind of trouble.
DEAN=>He's not here, Annie. But he is alright. Believe me, I would never let anything happen to that little guy.
KENT=>Alright, I've had enough!
KENT=>You and you! Start rummaging around! Tip some tables over! Kick open doors! Break stuff! You know the drill!
DEAN=>We all hear you yacking, daddy-o, but no one's listening.
KENT=>Not yet. Not yet.
HOGARTH=>I know this is hard for you to understand, but...well, it might be a real long time before we get to hang out like this again.
HOGARTH=>Yeah, it is beautiful, isn't it?
HOGARTH=>It's a deer. "Deeeer."
GIANT=>Deeeer...
HOGARTH=>That way!
HOGARTH=>Shhhhh... let's get closer...
HOGARTH=>You caught it!
HOGARTH=>It's... dead.
GIANT=>Deh...?
HOGARTH=>Don't do that! It's dead. Okay?? That means it's not going to move! It's gone! And it's not coming back, understand?? It's not ever going to come back...
DEAN=>This is bad. This is very bad. The Army's on it's way. We've got to get him
HOGARTH=>He doesn't know how to think about it.
DEAN=>You've got talk to him. You've got to get through to him.
HOGARTH=>Me? I don't know about this stuff...
DEAN=>You know as much as anyone does, kid. And he trusts you. Speak from your heart. It's the only chance we've got.
HOGARTH=>Alright. I'll try.
HOGARTH=>It wasn't your fault.
HOGARTH=>Things die. It's part of life.
DEAN=>What's he doing?
HOGARTH=>He's thinking. It's not an easy thing to understand.
KENT=>But Sir... you're making a big mistake! We're close... I have a real gut fee--
CHIEF=>Mansley, if I hear about your gut feelings one more time I'm going to vomit through the phone lines!! The press has got ahold of this thing and now I'm a laughing stock for spending tax dollars on your IDIOTIC plan! I'm pulling those troops out THIS MINUTE! Before MY career is as dead as YOURS!!
HOGARTH=>Oh no...
DEAN=>What is it?
HOGARTH=>I was going to tell you...
DEAN=>Good God, Hogarth he's armed??! How could you keep this from me?
HOGARTH=>Would you have let him stay?
DEAN=>No!
HOGARTH=>That's why.
DEAN=>Oh, man. Oh man, Hogarth! This is serious! What are we doing?? He's not some lost puppy...he's a weapon!!
HOGARTH=>Dean, shh--
DEAN=>He's a machine, Hogarth! He was made, designed--to kill!
DEAN=>This is bad.
HOGARTH=>We gotta find him!
DEAN=>Come on!
DEAN=>He's headed right toward town.
GIANT=>Rock.
KENT=>STOP! I know this'll sound crazy, but--
MOTHER=>It's got my baby!
MOTHER=>Shoot it!
HOGARTH=>No!
KENT=>Seize them.
HOGARTH=>Hey! Get your hands off! Let go of me! You're hurting me! Help!!
HOGARTH=>Let go of me! You're hurting me! Help!!
GENERAL=>He's got the boy!! HOLD YOUR FIRE!
KENT=>It's KILLED the boy!! Don't let it get away!!
GENERAL=>This is General Rogard! Code red! Repeat-- code red!
ANNIE=>Let me go! I have to get to my son! What is going on?
ANNIE=>Classified? What do you mean?
ANNIE=>Open this door! Hey!
DEAN=>It's my fault. I should've done something... something different...
ANNIE=>I know the feeling.
DEAN=>I just thought the kid could use a friend.
ANNIE=>You were right, Dean. You were right.
PILOT=>We have him in our sights sir!
KENT=>What're you waiting for?? FIRE!!
HOGARTH=>What's happening...?
HOGARTH=>Steer that way!
HOGARTH=>I don't know!! Point your arms, maybe-- like Superman!
HOGARTH=>OK! Now land! Uh... drop your arms!
HOGARTH=>It's no good. There's too many of them. We'll never get away.
HOGARTH=>They're going to take you away, Giant. There's nothing we can do.
GIANT=>Rock.
HOGARTH=>Huh?
GIANT=>Roooock. Treeee...
HOGARTH=>Yeah. Remember when I taught you that?
GIANT=>Churrrrch. Skoooo saauuugz.
HOGARTH=>That was a great night, too.
GIANT=>Faa-grrrr...
HOGARTH=>Yeah...
GIANT=>Deeer.
FIRST MATE=>I've got a visual on the monster, sir!
CAPTAIN=>Do we have a clear shot?
FIRST MATE=>Not yet, sir.
CAPTAIN=>Get closer! Don't surface until the last minute!
SPOTTER=>Monster sighted off the port bow!
CAPTAIN=>We'll only get one shot!! Full speed ahead!
HOGARTH=>What's happening-- ?
HOGARTH=>There must be some mistake.
HOGARTH=>Oh no... oh no...
HOGARTH=>The missiles. Missiles! They're nuclear. Nu-cle-ar. When they come down...
HOGARTH=>...everything...
HOGARTH=>What? What do you mean? I don't understand!
ANNIE=>What is it?
DEAN=>Polaris missile, I think.
ANNIE=>Shouldn't we get to a shelter?
DEAN=>It wouldn't matter.
GENERAL=>This is your party, Mansley. Don't even think about leaving early. Lieutenant??
GENERAL=>He did it!
GENERAL=>As you for you, Mansley. You're under arrest... "and all that that implies".
HOGARTH=>But... the giant...
GENERAL=>Let's go home.
MYRTLE=>Why, don't they make a lovely family!
SASHI=>Pull!
INDIA MOTHER=>Shashi! Dinner!
SHASI=>Coming!
