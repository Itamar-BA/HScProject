CROWD=>Josie! Josie! Josie!
JOSIE=>You know in some movies how they have a dream sequence only they don't tell you it's a dream?
JOSIE=>This is so not a dream.
JOSIE=>It wasn't supposed to be like this. I was just trying to do my job. And then things happened. Well, life happened. And now I'm here.
JOSIE=>Trust me. I am not the kind of girl who does things like this. I mean, two months ago you couldn't have picked me out of a crowd...
JOSIE=>Told you. I'm over there.
RHODA=>Theater--
JOSIE=>Standard American calls for "er". Standard British is "re". So go for "er", unless you're a pompous American, then go for British.
RHODA=>No. Theater. Last night. We were supposed to go, remember?
MERKIN=>No way. No way. No way. Ech, hold on. What.
JOSIE=>Messages?
MERKIN=>Seriously? No way. No way--
MERKIN=>What?
JOSIE=>Merkin, do you think we could get some more yellow highlighters? I checked the box and we're--
MERKIN=>Okay, I'm back, so--
ANITA=>Guess who I did it with last night...
JOSIE=>Roger in Op/Ed.
ANITA=>Who told!
JOSIE=>You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
ANITA=>Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
ANITA=>Once it didn't happen for sure.
GUS=>Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
JOSIE=>It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
JOSIE=>Well, excuse me for caring about words.
GUS=>So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
ANITA=>Oh, man! Who told?
GUS=>Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
JOSIE=>Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
ANITA=>And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
GUS=>How many times have I fired her?
JOSIE=>Five-- Six--
GUS=>Eh.
JOSIE=>Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
GUS=>Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
JOSIE=>Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
GUS=>Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
JOSIE=>You've done five of my ideas.
GUS=>You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
JOSIE=>They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
GUS=>A flack jacket.
JOSIE=>A--flack jacket.
GUS=>Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
JOSIE=>You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
GUS=>Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
JOSIE=>Hey--I can be out of control.
GUS=>Copy by five.
JOSIE=>Be honest. Do you think I'm aggressive?
ANITA=>Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
JOSIE=>Yeah.
ANITA=>You stood for like a month.
JOSIE=>Just because I'm not out of control doesn't mean I can't write.
CYNTHIA=>Josie, you listen to me. If you feel you're a writer-- Here, deep inside, don't let anyone tell you you're not. Look at me. Every day I come to this paper and I pour my heart and soul into what I do. I feel it, passionately, to the core of my being.
JOSIE=>You write obituaries.
CYNTHIA=>Hey, if you can make a busted aorta sound good--honey, that's art.
ANITA=>Cynthia, aren't they only diatetic if you eat them one at a time?
CYNTHIA=>I eat 'em one at a time.
ANITA=>Y'know, maybe Gus has a point. It wouldn't kill you to relax and have some fun. Roger's got a friend, Marshall in editing? The one with the lazy eye? Maybe we could double date.
JOSIE=>Forget it.
ANITA=>I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
JOSIE=>I'm concentrating on my career right now.
ANITA=>Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
JOSIE=>Anita!
ANITA=>Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy— If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
JOSIE=>The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
ANITA=>Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
JOSIE=>When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
ANITA=>Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
JOSIE=>I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
CYNTHIA=>"That thing"? Is that what you kids are calling it these days?
JOSIE=>That thing. That moment. You kiss someone and it's like the world around you gets all hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this other person and you know that one person is the person you're meant to be kissing for the rest of your life. And for that one moment you've been given this amazing gift and you want to laugh and cry at the same time because you're so lucky you found it, and so scared that it will all go away.
CYNTHIA=>Damn, girl. You are a writer.
ROB=>Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
MONTY=>I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
ROB=>I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
MONTY=>Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
ROB=>I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
MONTY=>Aloha! Welcome!
ROB=>Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
ROB=>Thanks, Jos. I'll pay you back. Bambi thanks you, too.
JOSIE=>That is so--weird that you name your car.
ROB=>No it's not. Guys name their penises.
JOSIE=>Okaaaay.... That car's going to bankrupt you.
ROB=>She just needs a new windshield wiper.
JOSIE=>Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
ROB=>Y'know what? Take it. I don't want it.
JOSIE=>Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
ROB=>No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
JOSIE=>Better person than I.
ROB=>See!
JOSIE=>I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
ROB=>I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
JOSIE=>This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
ROB=>Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
JOSIE=>How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
ROB=>Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
JOSIE=>For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
MONTY=>Come again!
JOSIE=>There. What d'you think, guys? Where should it go?
JOSIE=>Hmm. What's that? Bedroom? Great idea!
JOSIE=>Perfect.
RIGFORT=>Let me start out by saying that I was very impressed by the investigative piece Dutton did on pesticides in our supermarkets.
RIGFORT=>But since the Trib did a better piece on the same subject, you're fired.
RIGFORT=>You heard me. Out. Out.
RIGFORT=>So. Happy March everybody!
ALL=>Happy March Mr. Rigfort.
RIGFORT=>To celebrate, I've decided it's time for another undercover feature!
RIGFORT=>You all know that some of my best inspiration comes from personal experience. Who knew that my botched foray into hair plugs would lead to last month's award-winning expose -- "hair today, gone tomorrow"? Hat's off to you, Bruns.
RIGFORT=>Or should I say "hat's on"! And what about when my wife had that affair with Gil, her ski instructor and Howard went undercover as an expert slalom skier.
RIGFORT=>So last night I'm sitting around the dinner table with my family. The wife, the two nannies, the boys, and we're eating chicken with this peanut sauce.
GUS=>Undercover chef. I like it.
RIGFORT=>Hang on, Gus. So, we're eating this peanut sauce and suddenly the younger kid starts choking.
ANITA=>I'm smelling undercover ER nurse.
RIGFORT=>Turns out he's allergic to peanuts. And I think -- holy shit. I don't even know my own kids. I mean, who knows if they're even mine? And it got me thinking. How much do we know about kids today? What are they thinking? How many of them are allergic to peanuts? Boom. It hit me -- "My Semester In High School."
RIGFORT=>You. What's your name?
JOSIE=>Josie. Josie Geller.
RIGFORT=>You enroll on Friday.
JOSIE=>Oh. But--I'm not a reporter yet...
RIGFORT=>And none of these geezers could pass for a day under 40. Have fun.
JOSIE=>It's finally happening, Anita! I'm going to write!
JOSIE=>My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
ANITA=>Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
JOSIE=>You don't think I can do it.
ANITA=>No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
GUS=>Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
JOSIE=>But I don't want it straightened out.
GUS=>Geller, this is way out of your league.
JOSIE=>Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
ANITA=>Jos, that's not what we're --
JOSIE=>Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
ANITA=>Senorita Josie.
JOSIE=>And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
GUS=>YOU DID.
ANITA=>YOU KNIT?
JOSIE=>So, this is my chance.
GUS=>I'm not holding your job for you, Geller.
GUS=>Don't make me send you the memo on hugging in the workplace.
ANITA=>I do believe in you, Jos. Anything you need, I'll help you out.
JOSIE=>You can start by handing me that bag.
ROB=>No. Uh, uh.
JOSIE=>It's just for a couple of months.
ROB=>You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
JOSIE=>I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
JOSIE=>You can name it whatever you want.
ROB=>Wow. This must be big.
JOSIE=>I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
JOSIE=>What!?
ROB=>Do you remember high school?
JOSIE=>It was a long time ago -
ROB=>Don't you remember what they called you?
ROB=>Josie -
ALL=>Josie Grossie. Josie Grossie. Josie Grossie.
JOSIE=>Josie Grossie.
ROB=>I know. I came up with it. You look nauseous.
JOSIE=>Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
JOSIE=>Hey, Billy Prince, I noticed you weren't in math today, and I have the notes in case you want -
JOSIE=>This is a very bad idea.
ANITA=>So, you were a geek. Big deal.
JOSIE=>Anita, remember espadrilles?
ANITA=>Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
JOSIE=>The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
ANITA=>Okay. That's bad.
JOSIE=>At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
ANITA=>Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
ANITA=>Now this is cute.
JOSIE=>That is lingerie.
ANITA=>So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
JOSIE=>What'd you feel when you kissed him?
ANITA=>Bridgework?
JOSIE=>Very romantic.
JOSIE=>How about this?
ANITA=>I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
ANITA=>Cuuuute!
JOSIE=>'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
ANITA=>And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
JOSIE=>Anita!
ANITA=>Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
JOSIE=>Okay, I can do this. Piece of cake. I can do this.
JOSIE=>Yeah, okay. Feeling good...
GUARD=>Hey--where are you going?
JOSIE=>Oh, I'm a student. Most definitely a student. In high school. Here. I am going to class. With my fellow students. Hi. Hi there.
GUARD=>Freak.
GUARD=>Weapon.
JOSIE=>Hi--um, I'm looking for Room 204, Ms. Knox?
JOSIE=>Ow. I mean, wow. Wow. Great directions. Clear. Concise.
BOY=>Freak.
MS. KNOX=>Hi - hello. Wilkommen. Entre.
JOSIE=>Sorry I'm late.
MS. KNOX=>Yes, well, I'm sorry I forgot to take my hot flash medication this morning. Josie, right? Please sit. Mi casa es su casa.
KIRSTEN=>That is so sad --
KRISTEN=>I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
MS. KNOX=>Josie, in my classroom, tardiness is unacceptable --
JOSIE=>I'm really sorry --
MS. KNOX=>Not as sorry as I am.
MS. KNOX=>Ole! Ten minutes in this hat, you'll never be late again. So, let's hear something about you. Stand up. Stand up.
JOSIE=>My name is Josie. I'm a high school student. I came from --
JOSIE=>Billy?
BALI.=>I'm from Billy-Bali. It's a suburb of Bali proper.
MS. KNOX=>Bali. Fascinating! What did your family do there?
JOSIE=>We were--sheep--farmers. We raised sheep. In Billy-Bali.
JOSIE=>Oh my God. Oh my God--do I miss Billy-Bali. It had--a really great...aquarium.
JOSIE=>Note to self--Research Bali. Kill Anita for picking out this outfit. Find and destroy sombrero.
KIRSTEN=>We sit here.
JOSIE=>Oh. Sorry--I didn't know these were assigned.
GIBBY=>They're not.
JOSIE=>Couldn't you two--sit there?
SAM=>Hi, everyone. I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
JOSIE=>I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
SAM=>Josie since you're new--I love to drink my coffee during class, and since I allow myself to do this, I allow everyone to bring beverages to class as well. welcome to Shakespeare's "As You Like It." Okay. How many of you actually read the assignment last night?
SAM=>Not bad. Now how many of you spent more than thirty minutes eating salty snack foods?
SAM=>Man. If I could just get you guys to read while you eat.
ALDYS=>Here. We can share.
SAM=>'As You Like It" is an example of a Shakespearean--
SAM=>Pastoral Comedy. Anyone know what that means?
SERA=>Oh oh oh! That's what they do to milk!
SAM=>That's pasteurize, Sera. But close. Same letter-- --three syllables--
SERA=>Parakeet?!
ALDYS:=>There's a minute of my life I'll never get back.
SAM=>Okay, anyone else---
JOSIE=>Pastoral means set in the country. Originally seen in the Eclogues of Virgil. It's from the Latin pascere. To graze.
SAM=>Did I mention to the class that I love our new student?
GIBBY=>Did I mention that the class also loves our new kiss ass?
SAM=>Gibby, that's not exactly the kind of participation I'm looking for.
GIBBY=>Ooops. Sorry.
GIRL'S VOICE=>Hi. This is Sydney, Student Body President! Okay, first. Bad news- The' district didn't allocate enough funds, so as of this afternoon, there will be no music department. Now, about Prom--
SYDNEY’S VOICE=>Voting on Prom theme has been completed. And the theme is--
SYDNEY’S VOICE=>The Millennium!
JOSIE=>Excuse me. What's in the Cole slaw?
CASHIER=>That'll be twelve ninety-five.
CASHIER=>That's real meat in the ham sandwich.
JOSIE=>Boy--that's a lot of bread for that bread!
ALL=>Josie Grossie--Josie Grossie--Josie Grossie.
KRISTEN=>Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
KIRSTEN=>Nah uh.
GIBBY=>Yeah, I read this thing that one bran muffin can be like two bran muffins sometimes.
KIRSTEN=>God. Food is so confusing.
JOSIE=>Hi Kristen.
KIRSTEN=>It's Kirsten.
JOSIE=>That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
GIBBY=>Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
JOSIE=>Right, right.
JOSIE=>So - tell me about yourselves.
GUY=>I'm Guy.
JOSIE=>Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed. Yikes. Bikes!
GUY=>Are you in special ed?
JOSIE=>Bye. Guy. Others.
JOSIE=>Aaaah! How old am I?
GUARD=>You got a pass?
MS. BROWN=>move it Geller! Move it! Move it!
JOSIE=>Must--have--water--
MS. BROWN=>What do I look like, your waitress? Now you're gonna complete these sprints, cause if you don't you fail. And if you fail gym, you're NEVER GETTING INTO COLLEGE!
JOSIE=>Oh--my--God--you guys are—still telling that lie--?
MS. BROWN=>That's it Geller--drop and give me twenty!
JOSIE=>Rhoda, make sure Gus gets-the whole message, okay? Yeah--bye--
JOSIE=>Wait a second-- No, not you--bye--
ALDYS=>They do it to all the new kids.
JOSIE=>Who's of they?
ALDYS=>Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
JOSIE=>I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
ALDYS=>When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
JOSIE=>Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
JOSIE=>Never mind. That is so awful that they hide your cars.
ALDYS=>guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
ALDYS=>They still would not know the difference between a synecdoche and a hyperbole.
JOSIE=>I know. It's pathetic.
JOSIE=>What?
ALDYS=>Well, do you?
JOSIE=>Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
ALDYS=>Nice.
JOSIE=>How long will they watch us for?
ALDYS=>Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
JOSIE=>Why do they listen to Guy?
ALDYS:=>Because he's Guy Perkins. Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
JOSIE=>Yeah. Let's do that.
ALDYS=>Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
JOSIE=>Oh I know.
ALDYS=>I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
JOSIE=>Hey--I went to Northwestern! Once. To use the bathroom.
JOSIE=>Oh. My. God. You'll really like Northwestern.
JOSIE=>So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
ALDYS=>Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
ALDYS=>I think your knapsack is ringing.
JOSIE=>Hello?
GUS=>Geller, I got your message. What the hell kind of story are you pitching?!
JOSIE=>It's my dad. He worries. Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
GUS=>You're a sick puppy, Geller.
JOSIE=>It's an expose on cafeteria food.
GUS=>And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
JOSIE=>Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
GUS=>Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
JOSIE=>You didn't taste the pimento loaf.
ALDYS=>They love to disconnect the battery, too.
ALDYS=>Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
JOSIE=>Thanks.
ALDYS=>Sure. No problem.
ALDYS=>Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
JOSIE=>Petty good.
ALDYS=>How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
JOSIE=>College?
ALDYS NASA.=>Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
ALDYS:=>"All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players."
SAM=>Anyone have any idea what Shakespeare meant by that?
SAM=>Anyone? Sera ... Megan ... exchange student who doesn't speak English?
SAM=>It's about disguise, playing a part. It's the theme of "As You Like It." Can anyone tell me where we see that?
ALDYS=>Well, Rosalind disguises herself as a man and escapes into the forest.
SAM=>Right. And it's when she's in costume that she can finally express her love for Orlando. See, Shakespeare's making the point here that when we're disguised, we feel freer. We can do things we wouldn't do in ordinary life.
SAM=>Brett when you go out on the football field in your uniform, what happens?
BRETT=>We win?
SAM=>You hit people. You yell. You touch other guys' butts.
SAM=>But it's okay, because you're in uniform. Disguise changes the rules I had these Spiderman pyjamas. I thought when I wore them, that I had super powers. One night I tried to walk up the side of the garage.
SERA=>Did you make it?
SAM=>To the Emergency Room. Yeah.
SAM=>Josie, why don't you read from Act 5, Scene 2, Rosalind's speech--
JOSIE=>"No sooner had they met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed..."
JOSIE=>Does he notice me? Does he hear my heart screaming his name-- sometimes it's so loud I think the Gods can hear my pain. His voice is so mellifluous, oh to get just one small kiss.
SHEILA=>O.K., what have you wanted for like ever but you didn't think it would -ever happen?
JOSIE=>That they'd start an Olympic team for grammar - like diagramming sentences and verb declensions and stuff. And I'm scouted for the team- just as an alternate, of course- because I'm so young. But then there's talk of me in the '96 games-
SHEILA.=>No-, better. Something better
JOSIE=>I'm the most popular girl in school, and Billy Prince is taking me to prom.
SHEILA=>Yes.
JOSIE=>What?
SHEILA=>Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
JOSIE=>Why?
SHEILA=>I don't know.
JOSIE=>The poem! I knew he liked the poem! Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
SHEILA=>That's what I'm saying.
SAM=>O.K. - just a reminder. Your paper is due in one week.
SYDNEY=>Hey guys! Bad news--Chem wing is closed. The Hazardous Materials Crew is on the way. Now, about prom.
SYDNEY=>Please join a committee--because we are going to KICK NORTHGLEN'S BUTT and make millennium the best prom EVER!
GUY=>Rufus! Prom is gonna be Rufus.
KRISTEN=>Rufus?
GUY=>Yeah. I made it up. Start using it.
JOSIE=>What is with this school and prom?
ALDYS=>Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
JOSIE=>Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
ALDYS=>This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
KID'S VOICE:=>And this year's prom theme is--the millennium!
JOSIE=>I left my bag in English. I'll see you later.
SAM=>Whoa. Deja Vu.
JOSIE=>Sorry. Forgetful.
JOSIE=>Dorothy Parker--
SAM=>You like her?
JOSIE=>I love the way she writes.
SAM=>Not the happiest of souls. "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
JOSIE=>But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
SAM=>True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope. Are you sure you're seventeen?
JOSIE=>Sure, why?
SAM=>Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
JOSIE=>Well, I'm definitely seventeen and now definitely late--
TYKE=>See, aren't you guys glad you took a break from that Denominator stuff. I mean, you shouldn't be spending your Saturday night studying the whole time.
ALDYS=>we should be spending it thinking of how we can better serve your baby-sitting needs?
TYKE=>They pull up at a red light, next to an abandoned drive-in. Josie peers in, and sees a BIG GROUP OF KIDS, standing around a bonfire drinking beers, talking, a few making out. She opens her window, sticks her head out, and tries to get a better look.
JOSIE=>What's that?
ALDYS=>That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
ALDYS=>Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
JOSIE=>Yeah, I know.
ALDYS=>I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
GIBBY=>No. It's lather, rinse, repeat.
GUY=>Wow, if it isn't Alpo. Coming out to sniff some hydrants?
ALDYS=>Oh, Guy, you on a little break from having an original thought? Ooops, I forgot, that's all the time.
GUY=>You guys aren't seriously trying to hang out at The Court?
ALDYS=>oooh, cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trashcan. Where do I sign up?
GUY=>And stay away from prom.
ALDYS=>Last I checked--this was still a free country.
TYKE=>There's a land that I see, where the children are free-
GUY=>Look, geek, why don't you just go home and play with your calculator. Figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to get cool.
JOSIE=>Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
ALDYS=>Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
JOSIE=>It is?
ALDYS=>Yes, it's lame.
JOSIE=>Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
ALDYS=>Exactly.
GUS=>Josie, I am appalled.
JOSIE=>Jeez, so am I. I had no idea that these kids- let's see- turn to A14-
GUS=>No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
JOSIE=>Oh. Right.
GUS=>Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
JOSIE=>Kristen got a quote?
JOSIE=>Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
GUS=>Have you been there?
JOSIE=>Uhh, no.
GUS=>Have you been to any parties?
JOSIE=>Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
GUS=>This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
JOSIE=>Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
GUS=>Do you even know these kids?
JOSIE=>They hid my car--
GUS=>Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
JOSIE=>Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
GUS=>OUT!
ANITA=>Hi Roger from op/ed--
ROGER=>Hi Anita from classifieds. We still on for tonight?
ANITA=>of course--
ANITA=>Y'know what? No, I don't think we are on. I think I have to stay home. Yeah. I'm staying home! I don't know what I'll do there, but I'm gonna do it. Alone!
ROGER=>Freak.
JOSIE=>Are mom and dad here?
ROB=>No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
JOSIE=>Good.
JOSIE=>I can't do it. I thought I could. I can't. I give up--I'm never going to be a reporter.
ROB=>Did you catch the score?
ROB=>No, I mean, no big whoop.
JOSIE=>I can't do this.
ROB=>These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
JOSIE=>Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
ROB=>Why is that impossible?
JOSIE=>Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
ROB=>Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
JOSIE=>Rob. Please focus.
ROB=>Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
JOSIE=>Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
ROB=>Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
JOSIE=>Is that true?
ROB=>Little known fact.
ROB=>Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
JOSIE=>Yes, desperately.
ROB=>Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
JOSIE=>Better than I...
ROB=>That's the spirit!
JOSIE=>George! What are you doing here?
GEORGE=>Just get in the van, Josie.
JOSIE=>What is this?
GEORGE=>Hidden camera.
JOSIE=>Wings?
GEORGE=>We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
JOSIE=>I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
GUS=>Geller, stop being a pain in the ass.
JOSIE=>Gus?
GUS=>No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
JOSIE=>What if I say no?
GUS=>I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
JOSIE=>Hey! Kirsten, Kristen, Gibby-- What's up girlfriends?
JOSIE=>I'M OKAY.
JOSIE=>And so it is Rosalind, in disguise, who is best able to see through the disguises of others. To say to Phebe, "Mistress, know thy self," to look at love from every angle, and to realize, finally, that she is in love with Orlando--
JOSIE=>Hey guys, wait up--
SAM=>Hey, Josie, hold on. You've been hiding something from me.
JOSIE=>Oh I don't think so.
SAM=>Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
JOSIE=>Thank you.
SAM=>So what are you thinking for college?
JOSIE=>College. Haven't really thought about it.
SAM=>That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
JOSIE=>Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college. We just go right into sheep herding.
SAM=>Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
JOSIE=>Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
SAM=>Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words-- in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
SAM/JOSIE=>It --and swallow whole."
GEORGE=>Uh oh.
GUS=>Showtime's over! Move-it! Back to work!
ANITA=>Gus, have you ever been in love?
GUS=>Leave.
ANITA=>Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
GUS=>Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
ANITA=>You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
GUS=>Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
ANITA=>Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
GUS=>No Roger from op/ed?
ANITA=>Nope.
JOSIE=>Excuse me. Hi. Do you guys have some kind of schedule I could work around?
ALDYS=>Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
JOSIE=>– uhh, must have forgotten-
ALDYS=>No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
ALDYS=>Oh – I almost forgot – I'll see you tonight at Big Cup. 7:30, right?
ALDYS=>Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
JOSIE=>Right. 7:30.
ALDYS=>I'm late for lab.
GUY=>That is gonna be such a sweet show. I am so there.
TOMMY=>Oh, yeah, man, I'll drive.
JASON=>It's gonna be Rufalicious.
GUY=>You're using it wrong.
BOUNCER=>You Drinking?
JOSIE=>I am not 21. I am only seventeen and I still attend high school.
BOUNCER=>Two of you?
SAM=>Josie--out on a school night.
LARA=>Hi.
JOSIE=>Hi.
SAM=>Oh, right, sorry. Lara--Josie. Josie--Lara. Josie's a student of mine. Lara's my-date.
LARA=>Nice to meet you.
LARA=>C'mon, c'mon, let's go dance.
JOSIE=>Hi. Is it okay if I sit here?
JOSIE=>Get it?! Get it?! He was a firecracker!
A FIRECRACKER!=>And she cracks up again.
JOSIE=>Oh my God! This music rules!
LARA=>She's a student of yours?
SAM=>She's from Bali.
JIMMY=>Freak.
JOSIE=>I'm telling you, Rob! I think I did it! I'm totally in! I was soo cool tonight! You'd be so-- You know what's a weird word? Fork. Wait! Wait! Did I tell you about my new friends? I made friends with a whole table of Rastafarians! Not one, a whole table! Oh. My. God. Someone ate my entire pie.
JOSIE=>Hi Guy. Guys. Guy's Guys.
GUY=>Hi loser.
GEORGE=>This can not be good--
GEORGE=>Oh man. Look up, girl. C'mon, Look up--
GEORGE=>LOOK IN THE MIRROR!
GUS=>It's like the All-Humiliation Network.
JOSIE=>Hey, Billy. I'm ready. Sure, I can just wait for you on the front porch. See you in a -uhh- jiffer.
GIRLFRIEND=>Jiffer?
BILLY=>Hey, write a poem about this!
JASON=>Hey--you okay?
TOMMY=>Wow. You took a pretty big fall.
JASON=>Yeah. Like every loser should. And they move out of frame, laughing.
JOSIE=>As every loser should.
VOICE=>Are you O.K.? Josie, are you O.K.?
JOSIE=>I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
ROB=>No. Josie, this is real.
JOSIE=>Oh my God! That's worse! What are you doing here?!
ROB=>I just registered.
ROB=>Manufactured at the Tiki Post.
JOSIE=>Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
ROB=>This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was! I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
JOSIE=>You're twenty-three years old!
ROB=>With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
JOSIE=>Hear one. Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
CROWD=>ROB, ROB, ROB
JOSIE=>Oh my god.
GUY=>Dude, you rock!
TRACY=>Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
ROB=>Thank you. I'm Rob.
TRACY=>Duh.
ALDYS=>Hey – where were you last night? I was worried.
JOSIE=>What?
ALDYS=>Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
JOSIE=>Oh. I forgot.
ALDYS=>Well, maybe you should forget about sitting with us too.
JASON=>Hey, Rob.
TOMMY=>Robster, what's up?
BRETT=>The Rob man. My man Rob.
GIBBY=>Hey, Robbie.
KRISTEN=>Hi there Robbie Rob.
GUY=>Hey Robo- how's it going?
ROB=>Nice pants, man. They are rufus.
TRACY=>Hey Rob, see you at the carnival later?
JOSIE=>Oh, please.
KIRSTEN=>This has been so much fun! We've been first in line for every ride!
TOMMY=>That's cuz we cut every line.
CARNY=>Where's your partner?
JOSIE=>I don't--I don't have one--
CARNY=>I GOT A LONELY RIDE IN BUCKET SEVEN! SINGLE!
JOSIE=>Do you have to yell like that?
TOMMY=>Of course it's Loser that's holding up the ride!
SAM=>This seat taken?
JOSIE=>Thank you.
SAM=>Whoa.
JOSIE=>Are you--scared?
SAM=>I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
JOSIE=>You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
SAM=>Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
JOSIE=>Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
SAM=>You remember that story?
JOSIE=>Of course. I remember everything from your class.
SAM=>Yoooooow.
JOSIE=>Don't look down!
SAM=>Out of my control. TOMMY! CUT IT OUT! ENOUGH!
SAM=>I said that as a chaperone.
SAM=>Okay This is okay. Smooth. Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
JOSIE=>That's what makes you interesting. As a teacher.
SAM=>God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
JOSIE=>You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
SAM=>You have to say that. You're my student.
JOSIE=>I don't have to say that.
TOMMY=>IF THE BUCKET'S A-ROCKIN', DON'T COME-A KNOCKIN'.
SAM=>Boys.
JOSIE=>I know.
SAM=>I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
JOSIE=>Why do you do that?
SAM=>I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me. You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
JOSIE=>That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
SAM=>Same here.
SAM=>All I can tell you is that when you're my age, the guys will be lined up around the block for you.
JOSIE=>You have to say that. You're my teacher.
SAM=>I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
SAM=>Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
JOSIE=>When are you going to open your eyes?
SAM=>I'm thinking when I'm home.
PACKER=>Hey Rob, thanks for showing me that new grip. It totally changed my swing.
ROB=>No problem, man.
ROB=>Hey, you guys know that girl, Josie Geller?
MATZ=>You mean "Loser"?
ROB=>No, dude, Josie. We used to go out and she dumped me. But we're still good friends. And she is… amazing, if you know what I mean.
GIBBY=>All right--that's it. Just water and Ex-Lax till prom.
ROB=>Hey--Josie's Dad invented that stuff. Josie's like the heiress to the Ex- Lax fortune.
KIRSTEN=>SHUT UP.
ROB=>Yeah. She's loaded. She spends all her vacations on the family yacht in the south of France.
TOMMY=>No way.
JASON=>She used to date the drummer for The Big Bad Voodoo Daddys?
GUY=>No way. I always wanted to be a drummer.
ROB=>Yeah well, she left him for the drummer from "Sister Hazel." Y'know the song "All for You?"
GUY=>That was about Josie? Rufus…
ALDYS=>Hey, Josie--I'm really sorry I snapped at you. Do you wanna--
JOSIE=>Oh, Aldys, y'know, I have to--
GIBBY=>Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
KRISTEN=>Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
JOSIE=>Okay, that's good to know--
TOMMY=>I can't believe you dated Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
ROB=>Hey, I told you--Josie doesn't like to talk about that.
KIRSTEN=>Yeah, Tommy, that's totally gochay.
GIBBY=>I think it's pronounced gauche.
JOSIE=>Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
GIBBY=>Duh, of course you would know that. From being on your yacht in the south of France.
SAM=>Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
ANITA=>Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
SAM=>You're Pam?
ANITA=>If you say so.
SAM=>Welcome juniors and seniors, this is Pam Kitterman. She's our district health counselor. She's here to lead our sex discussion.
ANITA=>I am? Oh, I am. Hi. Okay. Sex. Yes, well, sex. What's to say really, y'know? You like a guy, you do it. Sometimes he calls. Sometimes he doesn't.
ANITA=>Hi!
ANITA=>I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox! Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal. Oh look. Class is over already.
SAM=>I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
ANITA=>Right. Right.
ANITA=>Okay, sex. Let's see. Sex is really fun. When you're old enough. Which none of you are, trust me I should know cuz when you lose it to some guy named Junior with really bad breath in the back of a van at a Guns and Roses concert you're gonna wish you listened to your Mom when she said, y'know, no one's gonna want to buy the whole friggin ice cream truck when you're handing out the popsicles for free.
ANITA=>Okay. Any questions?
ANITA=>Okay. I know it's hard.
ANITA=>Difficult. But safe sex is really important. I try to practice it every day.
KRISTEN=>wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
GIBBY=>Sometimes opposites attract.
KIRSTEN=>Yeah. Look at Bert and Ernie.
ANITA=>So just..imagine the bananas are the real thing.
ANITA=>In a land called "every man's fantasy".
TRACY=>God, I can't do this.
JOSIE=>Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
TRACY=>You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
JOSIE=>Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
JOSIE=>You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
TRACY=>But I'm not a penguin.
SAM=>It's an analogy.
JOSIE=>Excuse me. I have to go die now.
SYDNEY=>Hey guys--Sydney again! Don't forget-- No going into the library cuz of that little asbestos problem. And about prom—
SYDNEY=>Really bad news. We just got the word from intelligence-- Northglen High is doing the Millennium too!
SAM=>All right guys, let's calm down. Calm down. Sit!
SAM=>Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
ANITA=>OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
ANITA=>Well excuse me.
SAM=>What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
GIBBY=>What do you think we are? Amateurs?
GUY=>Josie.
SERA=>That's not a theme.
GUY=>No, Josie will have the answer.
JOSIE=>How about--' meant for each other--Famous couples throughout history?
GUY=>Yeah. That's it.
CLASS=>Yeah. /That's it. /Rufus.
JOSIE=>Thanks. Thank you.
JOSIE=>I'm telling you Gus. It's a great story. They keep the tags on, then return the clothes after they've worn them. Gus?--Gus?
ALDYS=>Look, there goes another Lemming.
GIBBY=>Josie, you have totally transitioned.
JOSIE=>Transitioned?
GIBBY=>You crossed over.
KRISTEN=>Into our group.
KIRSTEN=>It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
GIBBY=>Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
KRISTEN=>Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
GIBBY:=>Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
JOSIE=>Why?
KIRSTEN=>We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
KRISTEN=>We're very evolved.
COACH ROMANO=>Great playing, Rob. You might be just what Southglen South needs to get to Nationals.
ROB=>I'm playing in the championship game?
COACH ROMANO=>Playing? You're starting shortstop. And I don't mean to put more pressure on you but there are going to be some pro scouts there.
ROB=>Oh man!
GUY=>So--you going to the party at Rob's?
JOSIE=>Rob's?
GUY=>Yeah, you gonna be there?
GUY=>Good. I'll see you tonight.
GIBBY=>He is totally crunching on you.
JOSIE=>Do I want to be crunched?
GIBBY=>By Guy?
GIBBY/KRISTEN/KIRSTEN=>Oh yeah.
WORKER=>I really loved you in the sex-ed scene.
RHODA=>Splendiferous--
JOSIE=>Totally.
MERKIN=>No way ... Yeah? ... No way.
RIGFORT=>Alrighty then--next on the agenda- sack races at the company picnic- yes or no?
JOSIE=>Hi. Sorry I'm late. Sorry. Excuse me--
ANITA=>I love that jacket.
RIGFORT=>Miss Geller, what's the status on your story?
JOSIE=>Oh it's great. Totally Rufus.
JOSIE=>I have, um--
JOSIE=>--notes here somewhere- There's my math homework!
RIGFORT=>Geller, I don't need your notes. I need your story. Though I speak for everyone when I say I've seen the tapes. Compelling stuff.
RIGFORT=>But I want a story in two weeks. I'm saving the "Life and Style" cover for you. You're gonna make one hell of a reporter. Oh, and if you don't, you and Gus are fired.
RIGFORT=>Now, onto the next order of business. Marketing department-yes or no?
JOSIE=>Hey Rob, what's going on?
TRACY=>I'm Rob's prom date.
JOSIE=>Really? Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
ROB=>And a gymnast!
JOSIE=>She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
GUY=>Hey there.
JOSIE=>Hey. There.
GUY=>Come here. I want to ask you something.
ROB=>See you around the cellblock, Mrs. Robinson.
TRACY=>Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
ROB=>Well, a ball player.
TRACY=>No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
JOSIE=>Maybe we should go in a different room?
GUY=>I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
GUY=>Wow, Rob's sister must be such a loser.
GUY=>Come here, sit down.
GUY=>I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
JOSIE=>Yes. I'll go. Yes.
GUY=>Rufus. But I don't even know where you live.
JOSIE=>You know what? Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
GUY=>Cool. I'll catch you later.
JASON=>Hey Jos. Hey Robster.
BRETT=>Looking good guys.
TOMMY=>Hey Jos. Rob, rufus kegger.
JOSIE=>Rob, this is unbelievable. I mean--
JOSIE=>--I spent my whole life wanting to fit in, and now--
GIBBY=>Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
JOSIE=>Betty.
GIBBY=>Told you.
SAM=>I always liked Betty better.
JOSIE=>You did?
SAM=>Oh yeah. Betty was so spunky and fun. Veronica may have had great legs, but she was too moody. Very high maintenance.
ALDYS=>You can't not sell me a ticket to prom.
TOMMY=>Listen, Alpo--we can do whatever we want.
ALDYS=>Oh, I get it. It's that pesky making change part that's confusing you guys. Here. I'll make it easy. Money- Ticket.
SERA=>Josie, were Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum a couple?
JOSIE=>Well, in a strict sense, probably not. But for prom--sure.
SERA=>Thanks!
SAM=>You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
JOSIE=>Thanks. They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
SAM=>Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
JOSIE=>But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
SAM=>That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
JOSIE=>That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
SAM=>Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
JOSIE=>To put us back together again when we fall.
SAM=>Our penguin, right?
JOSIE=>Do you think you'll find her?
SAM=>Yeah, actually I do.
SAM=>Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
JOSIE=>What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
SAM=>No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
JOSIE=>Oh--yikes!
SAM=>told him --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
JOSIE=>Wow. You believe in me that much--
SAM=>Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
GUS=>That's your story!
JOSIE=>You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
GUS=>It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
JOSIE=>He's my teacher!
GUS=>And that's the best part. "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
JOSIE=>There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
GUS=>Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
JOSIE=>You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
GUS=>Josie, this isn't a joke. You heard Rigfort. It's both of our asses on the line. This is your story.
ROB=>Wow, Josie- you look really-
JOSIE=>Rufus?
ROB=>Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
JOSIE=>Thanks. And what are -
ROB=>Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
JOSIE=>Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
ROB=>I know.
GUY=>Come on beautiful - what are you waiting for?
SERA=>Hello! If you don't hurry up we're gonna miss the whole thing!
GIBBY=>Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
KRISTEN=>Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
KIRSTEN=>And I'm Evening Gown Barbie.
GIBBY=>Right. That's not an evening gown.
KIRSTEN=>It is on Barbie.
KRISTEN=>Josie, you look Rufus.
KIRSTEN=>Who are you guys?
GIBBY=>Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
JOSIE=>Rosalind and Orlando. From "As You Like It"? Shakespeare?
GUY=>Look! I get to have a sword!
PEANUT BUTTER=>oh, sorry.
CHOCOLATE BAR=>That's okay--
JOSIE=>Kristen, what are you doing?
KRISTEN=>I'm practicing my surprised face for when we get named to prom court.
KIRSTEN=>Sorry. There's no room at this table.
GUY=>You having fun?
JOSIE=>Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
ANITA=>This is the most beautiful prom I have ever been to.
CYNTHIA=>Did I miss the crowning?
MERKIN=>No, but I'm closing the pool in five minutes.
MERKIN=>Josie's odds are 3 to 1. 2 to 1 for Prom court. And even odds the kid sticks himself with the sword by the end of the night.
BATMAN=>May I have this dance-
TRACY=>Are you having fun?
ROB=>Yeah. Definitely.
TRACY=>Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
ROB=>Maybe we should sit.
MISS PIGGY=>Oh my God! Is this a pig in a blanket?!
TRACY=>Rob, I've - I've thought about it a lot. And I think- I mean, I know. You're the one. My penguin.
ROB=>Wow - I-
TRACY=>Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
ROB=>I'm gonna get you some water. And then, I think we should get back out on that dance floor and boogie.
GIBBY=>You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
KRISTEN=>That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen? Did I say that out loud?
GIBBY=>So what are you supposed to be? Other than freaks?
ALDYS=>We're DNA. A double helix. But I guess you'd know that if you'd actually passed bio.
SAM=>Well, the moment has arrived.
SAM=>Our 1999 prom court - the princesses are - Miss Kristen Rey, Miss Kirsten Leosis and Miss Gibby Zarefsky. And the princes are Mr. Thomas Salamey, Mr. Jason Way, and Mr. Rob -
SAM=>Mr. Rob ... Mr. Rob!
SAM=>Next up - Southglen's Prom King…
SAM=>Guy Perkins!
SAM=>And - this year's prom queen -
SAM=>Ladies and gentlemen – Josie Geller!
ANITA=>Yes! You go girl! Yes! Yes!
SAM=>And now - as it is custom - the king and queen will have their first dance.
GUY=>Hey--what are you thinking about?
JOSIE=>Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold". What about you? What are you thinking about?
GUY=>My sword.
JOSIE=>Oh.
GUY=>Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
JOSIE=>You said that already.
SAM=>Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
JOSIE=>Thanks. So do you.
SAM=>I always feel like such a goofball in these penguin suits. Like I'm at my own wedding or something.
SAM=>You wanna--
JOSIE=>Yeah, okay--
GUY=>Hey, listen--it's prom. How about we let all the old shit go. Would you like to dance?
GUY=>If it's okay with the rest of the double helix.
SAM=>Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
JOSIE=>Well, are you here with anybody?
SAM=>No, I'm alone.
JOSIE=>It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
SAM=>You're amazing, Josie Geller.
SAM=>So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
JOSIE=>Yeah, I have.
JOSIE=>There's something I have to tell you--
GEORGE=>What the--?!
CYNTHIA=>Tell him what?! Tell him what?!
SAM=>There's something I have to tell you, too--
JOSIE=>NOOOOOOO!
GUY=>What is your problem?!
GIBBY=>I knew it. You are a loser.
KRISTEN=>You ruined the whole thing!
KIRSTEN=>You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
JOSIE=>Let me tell you something.
JOSIE=>I don't care about being the prom queen. I am twenty five years old.
JOSIE=>I'm here as an undercover reporter for the Sun Times for God's sake and I've been beating my brains out trying to impress you.
JOSIE=>I want to tell you something. You people- Guy, Gibby, the rest of you who have been keeping the geeks down through the ages. You will spend your lives trying to figure out ways to keep others down, because it makes you feel more important. And you will miss out on so much. Why her, huh? What did she ever do to you? Let me tell you something about this girl. She is unbelievable. I was new here, and she befriended me- no questions asked. But you people, you were my friends only after my brother, Rob...
JOSIE=>posed as a student and told you to like me. But y'know--l have to thank you. I got to go to an amazing prom. I got to be prom queen. I got to be cool. It felt good. But not as good as being myself. And to all of you-- there's a big world out there. Bigger than prom. Bigger than high school. When you get there, it won't matter if you were prom queen or the quarterback or the biggest nerd in school. What matters is that you don't regret who you were, who you are- What if Steven Spielberg had quit the audio/visual club because it wasn't "cool"? What if Rosie O'Donnell had stopped cracking jokes because someone told her they were stupid? What if Michael Jordan never went back to basketball after he got cut from his high school team?. In this room right now, there could be a future Nobel Prize winner, a Supreme Court Justice, an amazing Mom. Find out who you are and don't be afraid of it. And if you'll all excuse me, I have some business to take care of.
GEORGE=>Hey--I lost the feed! What happened with Coulson? Gus is going crazy!
JOSIE=>So--surprise!
SAM=>"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
JOSIE=>No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
SAM=>What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
JOSIE=>You were attracted to me?
SAM=>Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
JOSIE=>Wait, I was going to tell you--
SAM=>You set me up. For a story. You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
JOSIE=>But now you don't have to--
SAM=>Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
JOSIE=>I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
SAM=>The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
JOSIE=>I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
JOSIE=>Please. Please don't walk away.
SAM=>I just can't look at you the same way.
ROB=>Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
JOSIE=>Really?
ROB=>No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
JOSIE=>wasn't even thinking about-
ROB=>No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
JOSIE=>I-
ROB=>No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
GUS=>Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
JOSIE=>Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
GUS=>I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
JOSIE=>We are not screwed. Yes, I made a mistake. But we will have a story. You will have an amazing story.
ANITA=>Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
JOSIE=>Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
ANITA=>You need my help?
JOSIE=>No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
JOSIE=>Merkin. Highlighter.
GUY=>Uh, hey, umm--Ms. Geller. This is totally embarrassing but my mom, she's all worried about me getting a job after graduation. She wanted me to ask you about like, an internship for me, at the Sun Times?
JOSIE=>I'll do what I can. And tell your mom not to worry - you'll do O.K.
JOSIE=>WOMAN COMING THROUGH! COVER UP WHAT YOU DON'T WANT SEEN!
JOSIE=>Hi, Coach Romano, my name is Josie Geller, from the Chicago Sun Times Listen, you know the local sports guy for the Sun Times, Jim Lakin?
COACH=>Sure, every coach in the area tries to get Jim to cover his team.
JOSIE=>Well, what would you say if I told you that I could guarantee that Jim and every other reporter in the area would be at the game?
COACH=>I'd say you can have whatever the hell you want.
JOSIE=>Someone once told me that to write well you have to write what you know. This is what I know. I am twenty five years old. I have never really kissed a guy. A geek to the core, most of my childhood years were spent doing extra homework I requested from the teacher.
JOSIE=>High school was more of the same. Then, at seventeen, it seemed as if my luck was about to change. The cutest guy in school asked me to senior prom - but it turned out he invited me as a cruel joke. I have never fully recovered.
JOSIE=>Yes, it is embarrassing to share this with the world. But it would be hard to explain what I learned, and how I learned it, without sharing this humiliating history.
JOSIE=>I received an assignment, my first as a reporter, to enroll in high school as a student, to gain some insight into kids today. Understandably, returning to high school was my worst nightmare.
JOSIE=>What I found?
JOSIE=>There's still that one teacher, who marches to her own drummer-
JOSIE=>Those girls are still there. The ones that, even as you grow up, will still be the most beautiful girls that you've ever seen close up.
JOSIE=>The athletes - and the immense sense of fraternity and loyalty that they share-
JOSIE=>The smart kids. Who everyone else always knew as the brains. But who I just knew as my soulmates, my teachers, my friends.
JOSIE=>And there's still that one guy, the one who is so perfect in every way, from the muscles in his shoulders-
JOSIE=>- to the way he, in his own way, struggles to uphold tradition. Southglen would not have been the same without him. High school would not be the same without him. I would not have been the same without him.
JOSIE=>All of these things made me miserable at seventeen. But at twenty five I finally see that this - all of this- is just the way it should be. It is all part of this thing- high school. A time in our lives that we can never truly repeat. A time that shapes us. A time that makes us who we are, for years to come.
JOSIE=>High school- going through it the first time- helped make me who I am. But going there a second time made me see that who I am is O.K. I always wanted to be "in", but seven years later, when they finally opened the door, I somehow gained the confidence to stay outside, firmly, happily.
JOSIE=>This is not the article I was sent in to write. This is the article I needed to write. I lived a lifetime of regret after my first high school experience, and now, after my second, my regrets are down to one.
JOSIE=>A certain teacher was trampled in my path to self-discovery, and though this article may serve as a step, it in no way makes up for what I did to him.
JOSIE=>To this man, you know who you are, I am so sorry.
JOSIE=>And, I would like to add one more thing - I think I am in love with you.
JOSIE=>And so I propose this - as an ending to this article, and, perhaps, as an ending to this portion of my life. I, Josie Geller, will be at the State Championship baseball game – where my friends the Southglen Rams are playing for the title.
JOSIE=>I will stand on the pitcher's mound for the five minutes prior to the first pitch. If this man accepts my apology, I ask him to come to kiss me, in front of everyone, for my first real kiss.
JOSIE=>Five minutes may seem like a short time, but trust me, when you've been waiting twenty-five years, it's usually the last five minutes that kill you.
JOSIE=>I went back to high school and discovered I was a loser, again.
JOSIE=>And then I discovered it wasn't so bad. I wasn't so bad. So, now that I'm ready to start living the rest of my life, it would be magical if I could live the rest of it with him.
JOSIE=>Because inside everyone is a loser afraid to be loved, and out there is the one person who can kiss us and make it all better.
JOSIE=>Wow. It's packed.
ANITA=>It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
ALDYS=>It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
JOSIE=>Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
COACH=>Sweet Jesus, Geller - I had no idea there'd be all these TV crews here. This thing's gonna be on every station in the country.
COACH=>You more than kept your end of the bargain. Now go out there and get 'em.
JOSIE=>Could I have five minutes on the clock, please?
RIGFORT=>I got weiners. Hot weiners.
RIGFORT=>I love this. Sun Times readers, out here, making a personal connection to one of our reporters. This is amazing, isn't it? Weiner?
GUS=>Yeah, it is.
RIGFORT=>Wait a minute...
RIGFORT=>There's a bolt in my weiner.
RIGFORT=>Hey Howard, what are you doing for the next month?
CROWD=>TEN - NINE - EIGHT - SEVEN - SIX -
CROWD=>FIVE - FOUR - THREE - TWO -
CROWD=>ONE!!
SAM=>I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
JOSIE=>I finally found my story.
