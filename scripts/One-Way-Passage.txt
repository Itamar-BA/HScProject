MAIN TITLES=>over an ocean liner anchored in a harbor.
IMAGES=>of the cast with their names and roles SUPERIMPOSED, over which we hear the film's love theme.
DAN AND BURKE=>struggle momentarily but Burke is the bigger man and Dan is no match for him -- one punch in the jaw from Burke knocks him silly and drives him backwards.
S. S. MALOA TO SAN FRANCISCO=>"STOPOVER IN HONOLULU"
IN THE WATER=>Dan and Burke bob to the surface. Dan forces Burke's body under the water and
ON DECK=>Officers and passengers rush to the ship's side to see what's happening.
IN THE WATER=>Dan looks up to see:
ON DECK=>A crowd gathering at the railing, peering down at him.
IN THE WATER=>With all those people watching, Dan has no choice but to haul Burke out of the water by his hair.
ON DECK=>An even larger mob gathers.
IN THE WATER=>Dan reluctantly puts an arm around Burke and starts swimming for shore.
ON DECK=>Among the passengers watching with concern is none other than Joan. She peers down at the two men in the water, failing to recognize Dan.
IN THE WATER=>Dan struggles toward shore with an unconscious Burke in tow. Peering up, he sees:
IN THE WATER=>Dan sees Joan and smiles in recognition. He keeps swimming.
ON DECK=>The crowd of onlookers, grouped near a raised anchor, watch with interest.
IN THE WATER=>Dan reaches a wooden pier and helps Burke on to a floating log lashed to it.
ON DECK=>The crowd at the anchor watches in relief.
IN THE WATER=>Dan and Burke sit on the log. Dan rises.
A NEON SIGN=>shaped like an arrow. It reads: "To gangplank"
THE GANGPLANK=>is being unhooked from the ship. A huge crowd of well-wishers fill the dock, waving to passengers on deck and chattering noisily. Running through the crowd is Skippy who races up the gangplank just as it is pulled away and jumps onto the ship ahead of the two Hong Kong policemen who are chasing him. Skippy, relieved, sits in the doorway where the gangplank was anchored a moment ago and waves to the policemen who, left stranded at the dock, wave their nightsticks at him angrily.
CABIN DOOR=>A brief glimpse of the door to cabin B-55 upon which hangs a PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB sign.
A TRAY=>loaded with medicines, powders and pills -- the sort of things taken by terminal heart patients.
JOAN AND HER DOCTOR=>Joan sits glumly as the doctor stands over her, trying to be gentle.
DAN=>sits at the bar as a young bartender mixes him a drink.
JOAN=>enters the lounge and looks around anxiously. She spots
DAN=>who is busy lighting a cigarette and fails to see her.
AT THE BAR=>Joan joins Dan at the bar, approaching him from behind so that he doesn't see her. The bartender, having just poured Dan's drink, now looks up from his work and notices her. He raises his eyebrows and smiles in recognition.
AT THE BAR=>Burke joins the same young bartender who waited on Dan and Joan earlier. Self- conscious about his garlic breath, Burke screws up his face and glances in Dan's direction while deciding what to order.
DAN AND JOAN=>standing at the ship's railing.
BETTY AND SKIPPY=>watch Dan and Joan glumly.
DAN AND JOAN=>stand at the railing and look out at the ocean.
BETTY AND SKIPPY=>watching at the window. Betty shuts the curtain and looks thoughtful.
BETTY=>sitting in a lounge chair with a book in hand. She grins at
SKIPPY=>standing nearby. He readies himself and then adopts a drunken attitude, staggering forward.
WIDE SHOT=>Skippy staggers down the deck and pretends to lose his balance, collapsing on top of Betty who screams. Skippy, sitting on her legs, tips his hat to her apologetically as Burke strides into view, grabs Skippy's collar and hauls him to his feet.
BETTY=>sighs, whimpers, and employs her European accent, pretending to be a damsel in distress to engage Burke's sympathy.
SKIPPY=>peers around a corner at Burke and Betty.
BURKE=>hollers at Skippy.
SKIPPY=>watching from around the corner, laughs his irritating laugh to himself and heads off to the bar.
BETTY AND BURKE=>stroll down the deck. Burke is moody.
DAN AND JOAN=>Joan tells Dan her plans for the next day.
BETTY AND BURKE=>continue their conversation farther down the deck.
IN THE HALL=>outside the cabin, Burke arrives. He pauses at the door, looks around. Then, taking no chances, he draws his pistol and checks it. No bullets. He takes out the clip: empty. He casts a suspicious look at the door.
IN THE ROOM=>Dan readies a rope with which to tie Burke.
IN THE HALL=>Scowling, Burke nods in understanding, guessing that Dan has stolen his ammunition. He takes a fresh clip from his pocket, loads and reholsters his gun.
IN THE ROOM=>Dan hears Burke opening the door and stuffs the rope under his pillow. Then, smoothing his hair, moves to a bureau and grabs a cigarette. He turns to see Burke staring at him grimly. Dan lights his cigarette.
IN THE HALL=>Passersby murmur noisily, having heard the sound of a gunshot. Burke holsters his pistol.
BELOW DECK=>Noises from the engine room reverberate as Dan and Burke walk down several flights of narrow stairs. They pass a good deal of machinery, deep in the bowels of the ship. Occasionally, Dan must pause to get directions from Burke who stays behind him at all times. Finally, they arrive at the brig.
IN THE BRIG=>Skippy unlocks and opens the cell door. An amazed Dan appears in the doorway.
BELOW DECK=>Dan strides past the heavy machinery and climbs the narrow stairs to the deck.
AT THE GANGPLANK=>Joan looks around with concern for Dan.
BELOW DECK=>Dan hustles up the stairs, then slows to a walk as he reaches the deck.
AT THE GANGPLANK=>Joan moves off in search of Dan.
JOAN=>It's too beautiful.
IN THE CABIN=>As Dan watches over an unconscious Joan, he notices an envelope on her night stand: the farewell letter he had written to her early that morning. Somewhere off screen, a chorus of singers croons "Aloha Oe" as Dan takes the envelope and pockets it.
ON DECK=>Streamers fly as a sour-faced Burke leans against the railing and watches the crowd. A sympathetic Betty joins him and takes his hand affectionately. She maintains her European accent even as she tells him:
THE GANGPLANK=>being unhooked from the ship. A huge crowd of well-wishers fill the dock waving to passengers on deck and singing "Aloha Oe." Bursting out of the crowd is Skippy, wearing a lei. He races up the streamer-clogged gangplank just as it is pulled away and jumps onto the ship, well ahead of the two Hawaiian policemen chasing him. Left stranded at the dock, they shake their fingers and yell for him to "Get out!" and "Don't come back!"
ON DECK=>Burke rushes away from an amused Betty to join Skippy at the gangplank doorway. Skippy points to the policeman.
THE SHIP=>pulls away from the dock as the crowd waves and finishes singing "Aloha Oe."
DAN=>It's you, Doctor--
BETTY=>Shouldn't come here.
SKIPPY=>Good night, Countess.
A FORWARD TRACKING SHOT=>of the city as seen by Dan and Joan from the bay. Whistles and horns blow.
DAN AND JOAN=>taking in the view.
DAN=>lost in thought. VISIONS of SAN QUENTIN and a silhouetted GALLOWS are SUPERIMPOSED across his face.
DAN AND JOAN=>stand silently together at the railing, both lost in thought.
BURKE AND BETTY=>emerge on deck, walking side by side to the railing in another part of the ship.
BARILHAUS POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED AS BARREL HOUSE BETTY NOTORIOUS=>CONFIDENCE WOMAN STOP INVESTIGATE
BURKE AND BETTY=>standing together at the rail.
DAN AND JOAN=>Smiling into each other's eyes, they stand at the bar, holding drinks.
JOAN=>Remember our first?
DAN AND JOAN=>cross the stems on the countertop.
BURKE=>sits reading a magazine nearby. He looks up to see:
DAN AND JOAN=>exiting the lounge, arm in arm.
BURKE=>nods to Dan, making eye contact.
DAN=>looks at Burke, knowing his time is up. Dan turns to Joan.
DAN AND JOAN=>holding hands.
JOAN=>stands in her cabin, looking unwell. She turns and exits into the hall. We TRACK WITH her as she walks nervously along, glancing around for any sign of Dan. She heads down a stairwell.
DAN AND BURKE=>arrive at a purser's station on their deck, preparing to check out.
JOAN=>descends the stairwell and arrives at Dan's door. She's just about to knock when she hears the voice of the British steward coming from inside the room.
DAN AND BURKE=>still at the purser's station. Dan glances around uncertainly.
JOAN=>having reached the top of the stairs, looks up and down the hall worriedly, then we TRACK WITH her as she rushes in the direction of the deck.
DAN AND BURKE=>still at the purser's station.
TRACKING WITH JOAN=>who struggles through the crowd of passengers, searching for Dan. But there's no sign of him. She clutches a hand to her head, then presses forward through the mob.
DAN AND BURKE=>still at the purser's station.
TRACKING WITH JOAN=>through the crowded deck. She pauses and puts a hand to her head again. She grows dizzy. The CAMERA MIRRORS her dizziness but she presses on, disappearing into the mob.
DAN AND BURKE=>finally depart the purser's station.
AT A STAIRWELL=>The hallway is empty. Joan rushes into view and climbs the stairs. A brief moment later, Dan and Burke emerge from the lower deck and head toward the gangplank.
JOAN ON UPPER DECK=>apparently lost. She ducks in a doorway.
DAN AND BURKE=>stuck in the line at the gangplank which has apparently not been hooked up yet. They look around unhappily, unable to disembark right away.
DAN=>fails to see Joan appear several yards behind him.
JOAN=>sees Dan. She pauses, relieved.
DAN=>still hasn't noticed her.
JOAN=>raises a hand to him.
DAN=>hears her but doesn't want to look in her direction. Finally, he does. We hear their theme.
JOAN=>presses forward.
DAN AND JOAN=>hold hands and stand together.
JOAN=>peers into Dan's face, knowing she will never see him again. She smiles.
DAN=>shakes his head, with a slight grin.
JOAN=>glows happily. In the background, we hear the gangplank.
DAN AND JOAN=>kiss deeply. Passengers begin to file out behind them, down the gangplank. They break the kiss.
JOAN=>watches, smiling, as Dan, too, retreats toward the gangplank.
JOAN=>delighted, returns the wave.
DAN AND BURKE=>on the gangplank. Dan turns away from Joan. He and Burke descend. We TRACK WITH them for a moment and then PAN BACK UP, past the other departing passengers, to
JOAN=>who smiles and waves. She pauses, her hand in the air. A strange look crosses her face. She stares into space for a long, long moment as the passengers press forward all around her. Her eyes close. Her head tilts back. She leans backward into a passenger behind her ...
A TOY BALLOON=>upon which is printed:
AGUA CALIENTE=>HAPPY NEW YEAR
