DANNY=>And that, my friends, is what’s known in the business as the Wave of the Fucking Day.
DANNY=>It’d be like that time we took uncle Ross surfing and he showed up wearing a speedo.
SNAGGLETOOTH=>I think I got a dud...
PRINCIPAL=>We have just received word from our governor that a few isolated cases have been confirmed in the U.S., one of them right here in town.
DANNY=>You think mom has it. Don’t you?
DANNY=>My whole life, they’re the one thing that’s always been a constant...
MOLLY=>Goddamnit Snag!
KENNY=>According to this, we’re evacuating.
DANNY=>She’s cool, huh?
DANNY=>Here. Hold this.
DANNY=>There’s no way.
MOLLY=>WHERE’S PETEY?!!
DANNY=>WHERE’S SARAH?!
SARAH=>Help me grab their guns.
KENNY=>Why are you asking me?
DANNY=>The way I see it, the one good thing about breaking quarantine is that it means we can get the word out...
SARAH=>You got your safety off?
DANNY=>I just killed that guy...
SNAGGLETOOTH=>I need you to cut everyone else loose while I clear us a path out of here, alright?
SNAGGLETOOTH=>EVERYBODY RUN! GET OUT OF HERE!
SARAH=>Kill the lights!
DANNY=>Can they see us?
DANNY=>Kenny, shut up!
JAKE=>Just jump, bro.
JAKE=>What happened?!
JAKE=>...holy crap...
JAKE=>Yeah, it is...
JAKE=>It’s a mistake!
DANNY=>How’s he doing?
DANNY=>You know where Sarah is?
SARAH=>I died yesterday.
JAKE=>Hey, he talks!
SARAH=>Give him a hand.
SARAH=>Take out the dogs first.
JAKE=>...worry about yourself.
DANNY=>Yeah. I got you.
