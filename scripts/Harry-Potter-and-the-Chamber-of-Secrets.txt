HARRY=>Now you've done it.
UNCLE VERNON=>I warned you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
UNCLE VERNON=>And have you sending secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
HARRY=>What... Who are you?
HARRY=>Give me those. Now.
MRS. WEASLEY=>We'll manage. Right then. There's only one place to get all of this.
19A=>thru
19A=>thru
RON=>Mum fancies him.
HARRY=>He was a murderer.
LUCIUS MALFOY=>You must be very brave, Mr. Potter, to dare speak his name. Or foolish.
LUCIUS MALFOY=>Well, well, well -- Arthur Weasley.
HAGRID=>Ignore 'im, Arthur.
RON=>We better hurry.
RON=>IT'S NOT WORKING!
RON=>What's happening?
HARRY=>Reverse! Reverse!
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE=>I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
PERCY=>Hello, Sir Nicolas.
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! YOUR=>FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award -- But I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan, but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them now!
RON=>What do we do now?
NEVILLE=>Why is it always me?
RON=>He says he's done.
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me answer my fan mail?
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Fame's a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that.
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Transmogrifian Torture. Encountered it myself once, in Ouagadougou. The full story's in my autobiography...
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Precisely! So unlucky I wasn't there. I know the very countercurse that could have spared her...
HARRY=>He said he didn't.
RON=>Three glasses who?
RON=>When do we start?
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Not to worry, Harry. I'll fix that arm of yours straight away.
HARRY=>No... no... not you.
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. This won't hurt a bit...
MADAM POMFREY=>He should have been brought straight to me! I can mend bones in a heartbeat -- but growing them back --
MADAM POMFREY=>Well, what did you expect -- pumpkin juice?
HERMIONE=>You can talk to snakes.
HAGRID=>
HARRY=>He's the only one.
HARRY=>Maybe they're right.
HERMIONE=>Now, once they're asleep, hide them in a broom cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs.
HERMIONE=>I've already got mine.
HERMIONE=>Just go! You're wasting time!
DRACO=>So it's only a matter of time before one of them's killed this time. As for me... I hope it's Granger.
MOANING MYRTLE=>Ooh, wait till you see. It's awful!
RON=>Look at your tail.
TOM RIDDLE=>... the rumors were true.
DUMBLEDORE=>I'm afraid they are, Tom.
LUCIUS MALFOY=>Already here, Fudge? Good, good...
RON=>Can we panic now?
RON=>Nice knowing you.
RON=>Thanks for that.
HARRY=>... And Hermione... had the mirror! I bet you anything she was using it to look round corners, in case it came along.
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>V-very well. I'll -- I'll be in my office, getting -- getting ready.
PROFESSOR SPROUT=>Who is it the monster's taken, Minerva?
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description --
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>My dear boy, do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all...
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved. I had to track these people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. No, it's not all book signings and publicity photos. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog.
HARRY=>Who was it, Myrtle?
MOANING MYRTLE=>Oh, Harry... if you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.
HARRY=>Maybe it's asleep.
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>The adventure ends here, boys! But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. I'll even bind a limited edition in this snake skin. Say goodbye to your memories.
HARRY=>Ron? Are you okay?
TOM RIDDLE=>You won't be needing it.
TOM RIDDLE=>No, I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
GILDEROY LOCKHART=>Hello. Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?
DUMBLEDORE=>Therefore, it seems only fitting...
LUCIUS MALFOY=>From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school and its students. I assume the culprit has been identified.
LUCIUS MALFOY=>Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
LUCIUS MALFOY=>You've lost me my servant!
LUCIUS MALFOY=>Mark my words, Harry Potter. You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days. They were meddlesome fools too.
