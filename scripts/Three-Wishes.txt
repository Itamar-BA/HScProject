KAT:=>"Ladies! Your attention please."
KAT:=>"As most of you know, I have known Mary for practically all my life. During that time, she has been a true and dear friend, and I love her like a sister."
KAT:=>"So it’s with mixed emotions that I anticipate her coming marriage to Bill. Naturally, I’m very happy for her. Bill is a wonderful man, and he has made Mary truly happy. Heck, I’d marry him myself."
KAT:=>"But at the same time, it’s almost like losing a sister."
KAT:=>"So you just remember this, young lady – you are NOT allowed to just disappear from our lives like so many married women do, leaving their poor, unfortunate single friends behind in the wake of their marital bliss."
KAT:=>"I still expect to see you every single day, you hear?"
MARY:=>"So you’ll be coming with us on the honeymoon then?"
KAT:=>"Absolutely! I’ll go home and pack. Has Bill got a friend?"
KAT:=>"Seriously, Mary. I love you both and wish you all the happiness and love in the world. You deserve it."
MARY:=>"Thank you, Kat. You’ve been the best maid of honor a girl could ever have."
MARY:=>"And thanks to all of you, my trusted bridesmaids. How could I ever have gotten through all of this without you? You are my dear, dear friends."
KAT:=>"Of course, I’m her BEST friend. That’s why she picked ME to be maid of honor!"
TERESA:=>"What’s up with her?"
KAT:=>"Did I say something wrong?"
MARY:=>"No, it’s fine. Maybe she’s just not feeling well."
MELODY:=>"I hope Maddy’s alright."
TERESA:=>"Me too! I worry about her."
ANNE:=>"I know! She seems so out of it."
MELODY:=>"She used to be so much fun. Remember?"
TERESA:=>"Give me a break! All she needs is a man to give her a good tumble."
ANNE:=>"Teresa!"
KAT:=>"Well, believe it or not Teresa, sex is not the answer to everything."
TERESA:=>"It always works for me."
TERESA:=>"Yeah, right!"
MARY:=>"Maddy? Is everything alright?"
MARY:=>"Maddy.....Let me in."
MADDY:=>"No! I’m fine! I’ll be down in a minute."
MARY:=>"Are you sure?"
MADDY:=>"I said I’m alright!"
MARY:=>"Okay. Just let me know if you need anything."
MARY:=>"Don’t worry about those. Just stack them up there on the counter. I’ll do them later."
ANNE:=>"No way! You cooked the meal. Darn if you’ll get stuck washing the dishes too. It’s your party, for goodness sake!"
TERESA:=>"Yeah, there’s plenty of us here. It won’t take long. You just relax."
TERESA:=>"So what’s up with Maddy?"
MARY:=>"I don’t know. She seems so out of it tonight."
MELODY:=>"Tonight? She’s been ‘out of it’ for ages!"
ANNE:=>"I know! Ever since she broke up with Arnie. What’s going on with her?"
KAT:=>"Honestly, Mary, why did you even invite her?"
MARY:=>"She’s a bridesmaid. Besides, she’s my sister! How could I not invite her?"
MELODY:=>"She’s your STEP-sister."
KAT:=>"Geez, Mary -- if your dad hadn’t taken that trip to Boston...."
MARY:=>"Even so, she’s been closer to me than any blood sister ever could be."
KAT:=>"Yeah, but how long ago was that?"
MARY:=>"OK, so she hasn't been herself lately."
ANNE:=>"Lately? She's been in this funk for months."
MARY:=>"I know...."
KAT:=>"Well she's bumming us out. What's wrong with her anyway? She used to be a lot more fun."
MARY:=>"I don't know. She's changed since the breakup. I don't know what's up with her."
TERESA:=>"Well, let’s hurry up and get some more wine into her. Maybe that will loosen her up."
MARY:=>"Hey, Maddy. Is everything alright?
MARY:=>"Maddy, what’s wrong? Why did you run out like that?"
MADDY:=>"I just couldn’t stand it anymore."
MARY:=>"Stand what? What was it that bothered you?"
MADDY:=>"Come on, Mary. You know what it was. It was her. Kat."
MARY:=>"I know."
MADDY:=>"Why, Mary? Why is Kat your maid of honor and not me?"
MADDY:=>"We’re sisters. Well, almost sisters. We’ve been through so much together. I should have been your maid of honor. Not her!"
MARY:=>"I know, Maddy. I know."
MADDY:=>"Then why, Mary? Why did you pick her?"
MARY:=>"Maddy, I wanted you to be my maid of honor. You know that. You know I always wanted it to be you. We used to plan it, remember? We’d plan our weddings – I would be your maid of honor, and you would be mine."
MADDY:=>"I remember, Mary. I remember it all. But then you picked her. And now she just loves rubbing my nose in it. ‘Oh! I’M Mary’s best friend now! Why, she’s like a SISTER to me!’ How could you? How could you pick Kat?"
MARY:=>"It’s not like that, Maddy…"
MADDY:=>"It IS like that! It’s JUST like that! Didn’t you hear her in there? She was digging her claws in."
MADDY:=>"Just tell me why. Why did you pick her instead of me?"
MARY:=>"Maddy….I wanted you. It’s just….it’s just….. Lately, you’ve been……so far away."
MARY:=>"I don’t know, Maddy. I don’t know what’s happened. I don’t know what’s changed. But ever since you broke up with Arnie, you don’t talk to me anymore. You don’t come see me, you don’t call. When I do see you, it’s like you’re on another planet. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to reach you."
MARY:=>"Maddy, please – talk to me. Let me in. I’m your sister. You’re my best friend."
MADDY:=>"Not anymore. Kat’s your best friend now."
KAT:=>"Hey Maddy. Why the sad face? Aren’t you having a good time?"
KAT:=>"What’s the matter, Maddy? Cat got your tongue?"
MELODY:=>"Come on, Kat. Maybe Maddy’s just not a party girl."
KAT:=>"Well then, it’s a good thing she’s not the Maid of Honor. ‘Cause my job is to see to it that everyone has a GOOD TIME!"
KAT:=>"Now come on, Maddy. Loosen up. You wouldn’t want to spoil the party, would you?"
MARY:=>"Maddy’s just not feeling very well tonight."
MADDY:=>"That’s not true. I feel fine. Here."
ANNE:=>"So Mary……are you nervous about The Big Night?"
MARY:=>"Nervous? What’s there to be nervous about?"
ANNE:=>"Come on, Mary. Everybody knows you’ve been ‘saving yourself’ until you were married."
MELODY:=>"That’s right. We all feel really bad for Bill. How long has he been waiting now?
KAT:=>"Two and a half YEARS! Can you believe it???"
TERESA:=>"My God! I didn’t know a man could GO two years without it!"
KAT:=>"Honey, YOU couldn’t go two WEEKS."
MELODY:=>"Poor Bill! Maybe we should’ve gotten together and ‘helped him out’."
MARY:=>"Don’t you girls get any ideas! Besides, he’s only got a few days left to wait."
MARY:=>"Okay, okay – so I am a little bit nervous. I admit it. BUT – I got a little something to break the ice."
ANNE:=>"So what’s up, Maddy? How have you been?"
MADDY:=>"I’m fine, Anne. Just fine."
MADDY:=>"How have you been? Are you still seeing that guy… What was his name?… Steve?"
ANNE:=>"No… um…… He and I… We—"
KAT:=>"Maddy!"
MADDY:=>"No….uh…..uh……I didn’t—"
KAT:=>"Steve was cheating on her, and then he dumped her, remember? Jeez, Maddy – how can you be so cold?"
MADDY:=>"Anne, I’m so—"
KAT:=>"Leave her alone. Can’t you ever think about anybody but yourself?"
MARY:=>"Well ladies, as I told you, I have been feeling a little nervous about the impending wedding night ‘duties’."
MARY:=>"However, Bill has been a perfect gentleman for a long, long, LONG time…."
MARY:=>"He’s respected my desire to remain celibate until our wedding night, and I love him for that."
MELODY:=>"You’re SO lucky, Mary!"
ANNE:=>"I know! I wish I had waited…"
MARY:=>"Well, Bill is living proof that there really ARE good men out there. And you’re right, Melody – I am VERY lucky! And that’s why I decided to go do a little special shopping. So, seven days from now, BILL is going to get lucky too!"
KAT:=>"Wow! I hope Bill has a strong heart!"
MARY:=>"Well, I figured Bill deserved a nice ‘package’ to unwrap!"
KAT:=>"Okay, now everybody into their jammies! We’ve got a couple gallons of wine to kill off, and some VERY interesting videos to watch!"
KAT:=>"Come on, spoil sport! We’re going to make you have some fun if it KILLS you!"
MARY:=>"Videos???"
KAT:=>"That’s right. You can just consider them ‘training tapes’."
MARY:=>"That’s enough of THAT! Where on earth did you get that, Kat?!"
KAT:=>"I will never reveal my sources! You can jail me! You can torture me! You can—"
MARY:=>"Well, I’d have to have a LOT more wine in me to watch any more of that!"
KAT:=>"Your wish is my command!"
ANNE:=>"So what’s next on the entertainment agenda, Kat? Bobbing for apples? Pin the tail on the donkey?"
MELODY:=>"Or maybe a rousing game of Old Maid?"
KAT:=>"No ladies. Now it’s time for some REAL fun!"
KAT:=>"Now we’re going to play the game that delves into the deep, dark, stinky, slimy recesses of your very souls, where your most basic desires are laid bare for all to see!"
ANNE:=>"Oh no! Don’t tell me."
KAT:=>"That’s right. We’re going to play ‘Three Wishes’!"
KAT:=>"Aw c’mon! This’ll be fun."
MARY:=>"Yes, come on. I like this game!"
KAT:=>"OK, OK! Let’s start with……Mary!"
KAT:=>"Alright Mary… you’re wandering on a desert island and you stumble upon Aladdin’s magic lamp. The genie inside grants you three wishes. What would you wish for?"
MARY:=>"Hmmm…… Three wishes, eh? Let me see. Well……first, I would wish for a million dollars for each and every one of my friends."
MARY:=>"And for my second wish, I would wish for.....a nice house at the beach."
MARY:=>"And for my third wish........I would wish that Bill and I would have a whole bunch of healthy, happy children."
MELODY:=>"I would wish for a diamond as big as an orange, a brand new Mercedes, and......"
MELODY:=>"....for Roger to be better ‘endowed’!"
ANNE:=>"I wish for a new house, a trip around the world, and a boyfriend who won’t cheat on me."
TERESA:=>"....a houseboat, a big ranch, and a starring role on a major soap opera."
KAT:=>"OK, Maddy. It’s your turn. You’re on a desert island and you find Aladdin’s –"
MADDY:=>"I don’t want to play."
MELODY:=>"Come on, Maddy. Be a sport."
TERESA AND ANNE:=>"Yeah."
MADDY:=>"I said I don’t want to play. Leave me alone!"
KAT:=>"What’s the matter, Maddy? Already got everything and nothing to wish for?"
MARY:=>"Come on Maddy. It’s just a game. Everybody else told their wishes. Now you tell us what you would wish for."
MADDY:=>"Leave me alone, dammit! I said I don’t wanna play!"
MARY:=>"Maddy?... What’s going on?"
MADDY:=>"I don’t wanna play. I don’t wanna tell you what I wish for! Just leave me alone!"
MARY:=>"Maddy, please. It’s freezing in here. Please -- come away from the window."
MARY:=>"Please, Maddy. Tell me what’s wrong. Why are you doing this?"
MADDY:=>"What do you care? What do any of you care?"
MADDY:=>"I just want it to stop. I want everything to stop."
MARY:=>"Is this about being Maid of Honor?"
KAT:=>"GEEZ, Maddy! Is that what this tantrum is all about?! You’re whining because you didn’t get to be Mary’s Maid of Honor?! Well get over it!"
MADDY:=>"Shut up, you little bitch!"
KAT:=>"OK, OK! You don’t want to tell us? Fine! Who cares what your wishes are anyway? You’ve already got everything you ever wanted, don’t you? So why not just ruin the party for everyone! What do you care?"
MADDY:=>"You want to know what I wish for, Kat? You REALLY want to know? Then I’ll tell you! I don’t have three wishes -- I only have ONE wish. I wish I could go back in time and change one horrible thing I’ve done. Just one! I’d give all three wishes for that!"
MADDY:=>"There! Are you HAPPY now?!"
TERESA:=>"Oh, come on Maddy. You’re so perfect -- what could you possibly want to change about your life?"
MADDY:=>"I killed someone once, Teresa."
MELODY:=>"Yeah, sure! You’re kidding, right?"
MARY:=>"Maddy, what do you mean you killed someone? Was there -- some sort of accident or something?"
MADDY:=>"It was no accident."
MELODY:=>"Then what? Self defense?"
MADDY:=>"It wasn’t an accident. And it wasn’t self defense."
MADDY:=>"It was murder."
ANNE:=>"Murder??? How could it be murder?"
MARY:=>"It can’t be."
MARY:=>"Maddy, what are you talking about? You never murdered anyone."
MADDY:=>"I did! I did! I planned it! I thought it all out. I knew what I was doing!"
MADDY:=>"You don’t understand. I committed a murder. A calculated, cold-blooded murder. I deserve to die."
MARY:=>"No you don’t. You don’t deserve to die. Nobody deserves to die."
MADDY:=>"He didn’t deserve to die. But I killed him."
TERESA:=>"Maddy, get a grip. You didn’t kill anybody."
MADDY:=>"Oh, I didn’t kill him myself. I paid somebody to do the killing. But I committed murder just as sure as if I had--..."
MARY:=>"Maddy, stop it! You don’t know what you’re saying."
MADDY:=>"I DO! I DO know what I’m saying! I was there! I killed him! He’s dead because of me."
MARY:=>"Alright Maddy. Shhh. Calm down now. Tell us what happened, Maddy. When did this happen?
MADDY:=>"Six months ago. It happened six months ago. Oh God! I killed him six months ago!"
KAT:=>"God, Maddy. Was it someone who hurt you?"
MADDY:=>"He never hurt me. He never hurt anyone. He was completely defenseless."
MELODY:=>"Well I’m sure you didn’t mean to hurt him."
MADDY:=>"YES I DID! YES I DID! I did it on purpose! I was supposed to take care of him. And I murdered him!"
TERESA:=>"Well then who was it, Maddy? Who did you kill?"
MADDY:=>"He had so much potential. He could have been anything, gone anywhere. But he never got the chance."
MADDY:=>"He was so small... so tiny and defenseless. He never hurt anybody. He never did anything. But I didn't want him around. So I made the plan. I paid the money. I had him killed. Now he's gone, and I can't ever, ever take it back!"
MARY:=>"Oh Maddy... You had... an abortion?"
KAT:=>"Oh God... Maddy..."
MARY:=>"Maddy... What happened?"
MADDY:=>"It was when Arnie and I were dating. I really, really thought he loved me, you know? And I wanted to make him happy."
MADDY:=>"I should have waited. I wasn’t ready. We’d only been going out a couple of months."
MADDY:=>"I didn’t know what to do. As soon as Arnie found out, he dumped me. I had nowhere to turn. I couldn’t take care of a baby. What could I do?"
TERESA:=>"Jeez, it was just an abortion! No big deal."
ANNE:=>"Hush, Teresa!"
TERESA:=>"What? What’s the problem? It’s just an abortion. People have ‘em everyday."
ANNE:=>"Be quiet, sis!"
TERESA:=>"Well it’s true! It’s not like it’s murder or anything. It’s just, like, a piece of tissue, and you have it removed. Like an appendix."
MADDY:=>"He was NOT just a piece of tissue! He had fingers and toes! I could hear his heart beat! He had brain waves! He slept, he woke up, he kicked -- they tell me he could even cry! He was a person!"
KAT:=>"Look Teresa, I know you’re young, and all you know about the world is what you see on TV. But to her, this was her child, her baby – and she killed it. That’s what it is to HER. So if you can help, then help. Otherwise, just shut up!"
MARY:=>"Why didn’t you come to us? To me? We would have helped you."
MELODY:=>"Yeah, Maddy. Why didn’t you tell us?"
MADDY:=>"I wanted to. I wanted to so much. But the day I found out I was pregnant, I came home and heard you were engaged. You were so happy! Everyone was so happy and excited! And I just couldn’t tell you. I just couldn’t ruin that for you."
MARY:=>"Oh Maddy! I’m so sorry. I should have known. I should have seen something was wrong."
MADDY:=>"But you were so happy. And I wanted that for you. I told myself, ‘I’ll tell her tomorrow.’ But with every day that passed, it was harder and harder to say the words. So I made the decision, and I had it done. I killed my baby."
KAT:=>"It must have been awful."
ANNE:=>"Maddy – how far along were you?"
MADDY:=>"About ten-and-a-half weeks."
KAT:=>"Oh no... Oh Maddy..."
MARY:=>"Oh God. Maddy, your due date. It would have been..."
TERESA:=>"What? I don’t get it."
MADDY:=>"Any day now."
MADDY:=>"Any day now Mary – you would have been an aunt."
MARY:=>"Maddy – I’m so, so sorry."
MADDY:=>"I’m sorry I ruined your party."
MARY:=>"You didn’t ruin my party. I’m the one who should be sorry -- sorry I didn’t see what you were going through. Sorry I wasn’t there for you."
KAT:=>"Yeah, Maddy. I’m sorry too. We all are. We’re your friends. We should have been there for you."
TERESA:=>"Listen, I’m sorry about what I said earlier. I -- I didn’t know it could affect someone like this. I’m really sorry."
MADDY:=>"Thanks, Teresa. I appreciate it."
ANNE:=>"Can I get you anything?"
MELODY:=>"Yeah, Maddy. You want some more wine or something?"
MADDY:=>"No, I think I’ve had enough wine! But thanks."
TERESA:=>"I just realized, this could have been me."
ANNE:=>"What do you mean, sis?"
TERESA:=>"Well... Just that I don’t always practice safe sex."
TERESA:=>"I know, I know -- It’s stupid and dangerous. I don’t know why I did it."
TERESA:=>"But I know I won’t ever do it again."
KAT:=>"Yeah, well -- safe sex is all well and good, but I’m beginning to think Mary has the right idea with the celibacy thing."
MELODY:=>"Yeah, but then where are we gonna find guys as patient and understanding as Bill?"
KAT:=>"Hey, if Mary can find one, then so can I. Are you SURE Bill doesn’t have a brother?"
ANNE:=>"You know, this is our fault. If we hadn’t been so wrapped up in ourselves, we could have seen that something was wrong and done something about it."
MELODY:=>"That’s true. We could’ve saved her a lot of pain and suffering if we’d just been paying attention -- like friends are supposed to do."
KAT:=>"So what happened to us? We used to be that way. We used to talk all the time, all about our problems and stuff. We were all like sisters. Whenever anybody had a problem, we all shared it. What happened to that?"
TERESA:=>"I don’t know. Seems like we lost it somewhere."
MARY:=>"It’s like we’ve all become superficial -- like we’re almost afraid to face bad things. So we just pretend that everything’s alright. It’s a defense mechanism."
TERESA:=>"Well it sucks!"
KAT:=>"Yes it does suck! So what are we going to do about it?"
TERESA:=>"Well what CAN we do?"
ANNE:=>"I don’t know, but we have to make sure that none of us ever has to go through what Maddy has had to suffer."
MELODY:=>"Right! We need to start being best friends again and looking out for each other."
MARY:=>"Yes! We need to get together more often -- all of us. And to talk -- really talk -- about what’s going on in our lives."
KAT:=>"Okay then. Let’s make a pact! Everybody raise your right hand."
KAT:=>"We solemnly swear that from this day forward we will be the friends we should have been all along. We will call each other at least three times a week. And once a week we’ll get together -- all of us -- and share what’s going on in our lives. We promise never to hold back. We will always lean on each other, help each other, and support each other -- forever and ever. Amen."
EVERYONE:=>"Amen."
MARY:=>"Maddy, I wish you’d reconsider moving back in here with me. I really miss having you here."
MADDY:=>"Thanks sis. I really appreciate it. But I’ve got my own place, and I love it there. I’ll be alright. Honest."
MARY:=>"I know you’ll be alright. It’s me I was thinking of."
MADDY:=>"Well, I’ll just have to come visit a lot more often. So you’d better give Bill fair warning."
TERESA:=>"Oh! Hey! We forgot something!"
TERESA:=>"In all the chaos we forgot to ask Kat what her three wishes were."
ANNE:=>"Uh -- sis, I don’t think..."
MARY:=>"Yeah, it might not be a good..."
KAT:=>"No, no! She’s right. Everybody else went, so I should too."
KAT:=>"But I only have one wish."
KAT:=>"My wish is that Mary will make Maddy your maid of honor."
MADDY:=>"Oh Kat..."
MARY:=>"Are you sure?"
MARY:=>"Maddy, will you please be my Maid of Honor?"
MADDY:=>"Thank you, Kat!"
MADDY:=>"Well... I don’t..."
KAT:=>"And I want you to come to my house for dinner Monday night."
KAT:=>"Don’t even try it! I will NOT take no for an answer, young lady."
MADDY:=>"Yes SIR! I’ll be there SIR!"
KAT:=>"She’s a raw recruit, but she’s got potential."
MELODY:=>"And Maddy, I’d like you to come shopping with me this week. I have to buy a whole new wardrobe for my trip in April."
EVERYONE:=>"PARIS!!!"
MELODY:=>"Yep! And I’d really appreciate your advice."
MARY:=>"And first thing Monday morning I’m calling Reverend Petersen, and you and I are going for grief counseling."
MARY:=>"We’re going to get through this together."
MADDY:=>"Thanks sis."
KAT:=>"Um... Would it be alright if I come too? Just for moral support."
MARY:=>"Sure, Kat. After all, you’re like a sister to us."
ANNE:=>"Hey! After the wedding next Saturday, everybody comes to my house for a barbecue!"
TERESA:=>"Everybody except YOU, that is!"
MARY:=>"I never get to have ANY fun!"
