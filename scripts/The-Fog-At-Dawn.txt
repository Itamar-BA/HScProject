DISPATCHER=>Major Harada!
HARADA=>Is that our boat?
DISPATCHER=>I’m sorry, Sir but you can’t board here. You have to go south and take another one in Lucena.
DISPATCHER=>Corregidor is under attack and American ships are blocking the bay.
HARADA=>Where is Colonel Iyashi?
DISPATCHER=>He and his men have been ordered to abandon ship and make a defensive stand in Intramuros.
HARADA=>Those are not General Yamashita’s
DISPATCHER=>It was an order from General Iwaguchi, Sir!
HARADA=>It’s true then, we are in disarray...Okay, what are our instructions?
DISPATCHER=>There’s a platoon waiting to send you off in the harbor, Sir. You must also travel quick...the area is swarming with guerrillas. Take the Avenida on the 8th, it’s the only road that we have full control of. You will get your instructions once in Lucena.
DISPATCHER=>You have to go, Sir!
HARADA=>Hurry up! Double time! Double time!
HARADA=>Are you in charge here?
YOSHIDA=>Yes, Sir!
HARADA=>Is there anything that I need to know?
YOSHIDA=>Our instructions are to send you off smoothly and quickly, Sir. There will be another platoon waiting to pick you up in Panay in 0600 hours tomorrow. We don’t have enough time, the Americans are sealing off every access to the south. You have to go along the coastal route from island to island. Avoid the open sea at all costs. The boat’s captain knows what to do.
HARADA=>What else?
YOSHIDA=>We have to take somebody with us...a civilian.
HARADA=>We...a civilian? I thought this is
KAZUKI=>Yes Sir, I am going with you and we have to take Dr. Ito. That was the order from above and I have to make sure that you do it.
HARADA=>Make sure that I do it? Are you trying to threaten me, soldier?
YOSHIDA=>No Sir! I’m just carrying orders.
HARADA=>Where are the papers?
YOSHIDA=>There are none, Sir! I just know that those are my orders. It should be carried out under any circumstances.
HARADA=>Very well, who is he again?
YOSHIDA=>Doctor Takeshi Ito. You are responsible for his welfare.
HARADA=>Do not give me orders again, soldier!
HARADA=>The fog...very unusual. It’s more inland than on the sea.
YOSHIDA=>The natives think that it’s the ghost of thousands...trying to find a place to settle.
HARADA=>They’re right on schedule. Prepare to land.
HARADA=>There!
HARADA=>Anti-aircraft! He’s coming back! Get Ito somewhere safe!
HENRY=>Fuck! Fuck! We’ve been hit boys. I’m losing grip.
HARADA=>Yoshida! Yoshida!
HARADA=>Where’s Yoshida?
SAILOR=>He’s downstairs with Doctor Ito, Sir!
PAULO=>Y-y-you think they’ll let us have guns now?
MARIO=>I don’t know. Just hurry!
PAOLO=>Just ask your aunt. I’m sure she’ll let us have one.
MARIO=>She’ll kill me when she sees me...Hurry, fat ass!
MARIO=>Wait!
PAULO=>What?...You’re scaring me.
PAULO=>We should just go.
PAULO=>Hey! Where are you going?
MARIO=>Americano, Americano!
HENRY=>Shhh! Keep quiet!
HENRY=>Hey, quiet!
HENRY=>Do you speak English...English?
MARIO=>Yes Sir! We’ll get help for you.
HENRY=>Lower your voice...okay! No... don’t get help. Listen to me.
HENRY=>Listen carefully. I’m gonna give you this knife. You gather as much grass and thick leaves and lay it under me...okay. Get a lot...can you boys do that?
MARIO=>Yes Sir, you jump?
HENRY=>You got the idea! Now go, stay quiet and don’t let anybody see you...understand?
SANTI=>Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over...Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over.
HENRY=>Good job, boys!
HENRY=>Okay, here we go.
SANTI=>Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over...Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over.
SANTI=>Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over.
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Echo 8 this is Alpha 3. It’s good to hear from you, over.
SANTI=>Likewise, Sir!
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Operation Victor One is being planned at 10?43’00"N and 122?23’00"E. Pre-bombardment will commence right away in strategic areas.
CAPTAIN TURNER=>We need packets of blocking units in several points to prevent the enemy from going uphill. If you are around the premises where you were 48 hours ago, it is very important that you stay there.
CAPTAIN TURNER=>I repeat...hold your position and patrol your area until Victor One is launched. Panay will be liberated soon.
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Echo 8, do you copy, over?
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Echo 8, do you copy, over?...Echo 8?
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Dolores, my favourite guerrilla...good to hear your voice!
DOLORES=>Likewise, Sir.
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Well, good luck to you and your men.
DOLORES=>Wait...Alpha 3!
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Anything else?
DOLORES=>Sir, we would like to be in the city. Most of our men are there already. It’s only us here.
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Negative, Echo 3. That’s the order from General Arnold and Colonel Peralta has already been informed. It is very important that you hold that position. We’re close to wrapping this war up.
DOLORES=>There are no enemies in this area for the past month. Asking permission to join the resistance in the city, Sir?
CAPTAIN TURNER=>Negative, Echo 3! Furthermore, we have a missing plane 8 hours ago. In all likelihood, it may have been lost at sea. This is not your responsibility but keep your eyes open along the coast. A search party has already been dispatched. We pray to God that the crew are alive. Over and out now!
WILLIAM=>Go ahead, lots left!
WILLIAM=>Goddamn!
WILLIAM=>It’s me.
DOLORES=>I told you not to follow us.
MARIO=>But...
DOLORES=>Say a word again and I’ll kill you.
PAOLO=>What a loving aunt you have.
HENRY=>We were goin’ back from a torpedo run off the Visayan sea. Got hit by a flak off the coast, two miles south of Oton. My crew got hit...we went down hard! They didn’t make it.
SANTI=>Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over...Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over.
SANTI=>Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over. We have the airman...acknowledge Alpha 3.
ROSARIO=>Pa, give me the bag.
DOLORES=>When you’re done...I’m waiting to listen.
MARIO=>Poblacion...they killed everyone.
MARIO=>I can tell it’s not the Japs.
MARIO=>Hey...tell them!
DOLORES=>What is it?
HENRY=>They were telling me earlier about a village massacre...something very unusual.
WILLIAM=>There’s no Japs in the area anymore.
DOLORES=>You have to tell me now.
DOLORES=>Samurais and bayonets?
PAOLO=>No, like wild animals...
WILLIAM=>When did this happen?
MARIO=>We were there this morning before we saw Lt. Henry, but...I don’t know.
PAOLO=>The place smells bad.
SANTI=>No luck. The fleet must be moving way off course.
WILLIAM=>We should take a look at the town.
DOLORES=>Resume all communications in Poblacion. We got the airman, it’s all that matters.
DOLORES=>I want it back after. Poblacion is not too far away and we’re on patrol...We have to move fast. Let’s try to get there before night falls.
EMILIO=>Follow the path for 45 minutes, you’ll see a hut with an old lady inside. Tell her we sent you. It’s safe there.
MARIO=>We told you about this.
WILLIAM=>Get goin’, boys! If we see you again we’ll hang you off a tree.
WILLIAM=>Now get going...quick!
MARIO=>Fuck you, fuck you, Americano!
PAOLO=>What now smart ass?
MARIO=>They think we don’t know the jungle. C’mon let’s go!
WILLIAM=>It’s too obvious to be a trap.
DOLORES=>Nothing.
DOLORES=>You go left and I’ll go right. The usual team. You take the airman.
WILLIAM=>Okay, I’ll move my men around to the front. Give us five minutes headway, then you take the back.
DOLORES=>We’ll meet up in the middle. There’s a well there.
WILLIAM=>By the well.
DOLORES=>We’re too far away to see anything.
ROSARIO=>I know this village, I’ve work here vaccinating children before...this place is never dead at this time.
DOLORES=>Let’s move! Stay within sight.
SANTI=>Oh my God!...Fucking Japs!
ROSARIO=>I still remember some of these people. Everyone’s dead!
DOLORES=>Padre! What happened here?
FATHER MAURICIO=>I don’t know...I just went to the city and then this...No one is left.
DOLORES=>Did you see anything...anyone?
FATHER MAURICIO=>He was my "sacristan." His family is very active in the community and in the church.
WILLIAM=>What took you so long?
DOLORES=>Did you see any survivors?
WILLIAM=>No.
WILLIAM=>Who’s he?
DOLORES=>He’s a missionary and a parish priest here. He just came in from the city...didn’t see a thing.
WILLIAM=>Fucking savages!
ROSARIO=>This is bad omen, I can feel it.
SANTI=>They don’t normally kill like this...no guns were used.
WILLIAM=>How long did this happen?
ROSARIO=>Corpses decompose fast in this heat...I say, early this morning.
DOLORES=>Okay, let’s secure an area and rest for a few hours.
SANTI=>The church looks like a fort.
WILLIAM=>Fair enough but we can’t stay long, this place is too open.
DOLORES=>Okay... take the steeple, see what you can
HENRY=>What about the dead?
WILLIAM=>What about them?
HENRY=>We can’t leave them like this.
WILLIAM=>We don’t have time for that.
DOLORES=>The rest of you...scout the village perimeter only. We’ll pile all the dead in one spot, there’s too many to bury, we don’t have time. We’ll burn them before we leave. Emilio and Napo maintain positions, everyone else, rendezvous by the church in 30.
SANTI=>Look what I found.
DOLORES=>A "Senninbari."
DOLORES=>It’s their amulet...to ward off bullets and bad luck.
WILLIAM=>It doesn’t work...that we know of.
DOLORES=>They don’t take this off their bodies, especially when they go on a rampage like this. It’s strange.
GUARD=>Welcome to Iloilo, Sir!
GUARD=>Colonel Takahashi is waiting for you and Doctor Ito.
YOSHIDA=>Upstairs gentlemen.
TAKAHASHI=>Have a seat and stay at ease.
TAKAHASHI=>Help yourselves with Filipino rum, Scotch whiskey, wine...sake.
HARADA=>Thank you, Sir.
TAKAHASHI=>Hmmm. Doctor?
ITO=>No, thank you, Sir.
TAKAHASHI=>I’ll choose for you...a fine aged scotch.
TAKAHASHI=>We heard about the incident earlier. Sorry for your casualties.
HARADA=>For the Empire, Sir!
TAKAHASHI=>Major Harada...hmmm. I’ve fought tooth and nail to have you here, some against very powerful and influential people. People who wanted you elsewhere, from hunting down wireless radios to assassinating important people. CONTINUE
TAKAHASHI=>This won’t be long now. Luzon is falling, we lost Manila...MacArthur has made his way up the gutter...with his army and minions of pesky Filipinos.
HARADA=>We can still hold the Visayas and Mindanao, Sir. Up north, we can go to sea and block them south of Okinawa.
TAKAHASHI=>Ha! With what Major? On the north with the mighty Yamato and an amateur squadron of tokkotai bombers and on the south with a ragtag, malnourished army? Right now...it’s just a matter of pure survival. The most primeval instinct of humans...or any animal for that matter.
TAKAHASHI=>You do have a family, Major. We checked on that.
TAKAHASHI=>Imagine this...if you and your family are having a picnic...a nice relaxing day by the river when unexpectedly a grenade explodes a few feet away.
TAKAHASHI=>Your instinct is to duck first...split seconds ahead of thinking about saving your family. You think of surviving first.
TAKAHASHI=>Now...after that instinct has been purged...is where we define our attitudes and values. To be a savior or a coward, a hero or a traitor.
ITO=>The Major has a point. We have withstood the blast and have survived. Our moral obligation is to defend Japan, bring it back to it’s feet.
TAKAHASHI=>Which leads us to you being here.
HARADA=>Why am I called here, Sir?
TAKAHASHI=>You started your heroism this morning.
HARADA=>We lost five men. It was a close call...if not for the...
TAKAHASHI=>...the fog. Things like that happen everyday...wherever you are and whatever you do. There is always something unpredictable that would alter everything you expected.
HARADA=>It settles mostly on the ground. It’s unusually dense...yet, harmless.
TAKAHASHI=>It’s been like that every morning for three days now. What a sight to behold! But maybe we should talk about the weather some other time. We have some business to attend to right now. Doctor?
ITO=>Unit 731, Major...that’s our ace.
ITO=>I am part of Doctor Kitano’s team under General Ishii’s "Togo Unit." have you heard of it, Major?
ITO=>We have to be ahead of the Americans and the Russians on this matter.
HARADA=>Biological warfare?
TAKAHASHI=>More than that, Major. A chance for Japan to finally emerge over all these adversities.
HARADA=>By unleashing germ warfare? It did not work in World War I.
TAKAHASHI=>I said more than that, Major. Ito is from the Neuro-Science department of 731. He is a geneticist, neurologist and an anatomist. Make it simple, Doctor.
ITO=>My pleasure, Colonel. At 731, one of our projects is how to enhance the Imperial Army. Not in equipments or weapons but more on...let’s say...body, spirit and mind. This would set our army above any other in the world.
ITO=>Through science, we believe we have achieved it.
HARADA=>Is that why we’re here?...My soldiers?
ITO=>No, not your soldiers, they are just escorting you on the boat trip.
TAKAHASHI=>We already have a company of 85 soldiers on the move as of now...in the southern part of the island. They are the first to be launched on this pilot project, codename "Operation Baku." We have received reliable reports that the Americans are going to land in that area.
ITO=>You see, Major, this is the experimental stage of the operation. The recipient company is composed of the best fighters that we have. "Baku" was applied to them four days ago in Manila before they were dropped off where they are now. The results should be promising.
HARADA=>Should be?
TAKAHASHI=>We don’t have much time in this
HARADA=>How did you "implement" it?
TAKAHASHI=>Major, you have to remember the importance of this mission. Even I...am not allowed to know that.
TAKAHASHI=>You will accompany Ito on a mission.
HARADA=>What’s my objective?
TAKAHASHI=>Ito’s objective, Major. Yours is to make sure he succeeds.
ITO=>I only monitored the soldiers for 36 hours in Manila, then they were dispatched. I need more time to study them...mentally and physically. Their behaviors and how they react to various situations. You see, in those 36 hours, there are a lot of unanswered questions that is vital for the success of this project.
ITO=>The long term effect of "Baku" on the individuals. Will it wane, maintain or become stronger. And, the duration of it’s effectiveness.
TAKAHASHI=>Ito will study the progress of "The Baku" company. We haven’t heard from them in the last two days. They are, should we say, "lost" in the jungle.
HARADA=>Baku... the devourer of nightmares. Like the being in Japanese folklore.
ITO=>A perfect name for the mission. I’m sure when you were a kid you called out the "Baku" to take your nightmares away.
HARADA=>Did they engage yet?
TAKAHASHI=>We don’t know.
HARADA=>So...no radio contact?
HARADA=>Sir?
TAKAHASHI=>You are to go to the area with Ito and a "hojin" . She will be your navigator. You will go as civilians, Ito as your friend and the "hojin" as your wife. You will bring nothing except a compass. Find the soldiers so the doctor can monitor them. They are under the command of Lieutenant Daisuke Sato, he knows you.
HARADA=>Sato...Sato. Yes, I remember him. we were in training school together...in Keijo and Formosa.
TAKAHASHI=>The area is crawling with guerrilla activities. It is wise to abandon your military self and become a civilian for this mission. In the meantime, the rest of your men will CONTINUE
HARADA=>Of course...Sir.
TAKAHASHI=>Very well, that’s why we chose you. Because of your resiliency, track record and good command of English. The Empire depends on you. This may turn the tides of war in our favor.
ITO=>We only need a few days, Major. Four days of utmost secrecy.
HARADA=>I need more details, Sir.
TAKAHASHI=>You will be briefed downstairs by and travel by foot immediately. The guerrillas have started punitive raids inside the city and out. Be discreet and smart. No forms of communication will be used. When Ito is satisfied with his findings, you will lead him to a specified area where somebody will be waiting to pick you up. You have four days.
HARADA=>Yes, Sir!
TAKAHASHI=>If you don’t to show up in four days, we will consider this mission a failure...and, you know what to do.
HARADA=>Yes, Sir!
TAKAHASHI=>Major!
TAKAHASHI=>One last thing...the fog. It might not be on your side the next time around.
OLDER BOY=>Father...
HARADA=>Baku... Fucking war!
HARADA=>Come in.
YOSHIDA=>Are you okay, Sir?
YOSHIDA=>You passed out earlier, Sir. Heat exhaustion, it’s pretty normal here.
HARADA=>Somebody’s following us.
MICHIKO=>There’s guerrilla activities in this area.
MICHIKO=>It’s almost dark, we need to find a place to rest.
MICHIKO=>We’re seven kilometers north from the five kilometer radius of objective.
EMILIO=>You stupid brats! Stay off the road. I could’ve shot you.
EMILIO=>Did anybody see you coming here?
MARIO=>I-I-I don’t think so.
PAOLO=>We saw people.
EMILIO=>What people?
MARIO=>"Hojins."
EMILIO=>"Hojins." What the hell are they doing here?
EMILIO=>Where and how many?
MARIO=>Three of them and they’re heading this way.
EMILIO=>Are you sure?
MARIO=>Did we lie about the village?
EMILIO=>How far away?
MARIO=>Not far, they’re just behind us.
EMILIO=>Okay, show me.
EMILIO=>Don’t you dare. Go, show me!
PAOLO=>I know you’re here.
WILLIAM=>I told you not to follow us.
PAOLO=>No, Sir. You don’t understand. One of your men, he...
WILLIAM=>Where is he now?
PAOLO=>Me and Mario saw some "hojins" in the jungle. We told him and he’s out to get them.
HENRY=>What’s a "hojin?"
ROSARIO=>Japanese migrants living in the city.
DOLORES=>Show us where!
DOLORES=>We gotta move!
DOLORES=>You come with us. The rest of you, perimeter on the road and the church.
DOLORES=>Run!
HARADA=>We are not soldiers.
MARIO=>He said they’re not soldiers.
EMILIO=>Tell him to kneel.
MARIO=>Sir, please kneel.
HARADA=>We’re not armed. We’re only civilians.
EMILIO=>Kneel!
HARADA=>We’re running away from the war. My wife is three
DOLORES=>Put your gun down.
WILLIAM=>Put the gun down.
DOLORES=>Emilio!
DOLORES=>They are civilians.
DOLORES=>We don’t kill them.
WILLIAM=>What the hell are you doing here?
WILLIAM=>Great...no English!
HARADA=>U of C, Berkeley. Department of Arts and Humanities, majoring in Art History, class of ’32.
WILLIAM=>Shit...so what the hell are you doing here?
HARADA=>I’m Harada and this is my wife Michiko and my friend Ito. They don’t speak English.
WILLIAM=>Why are you here?
HARADA=>We have a small eatery in Calle Real...a ramen house. The news of an American victory in Luzon...and hostile Filipinos made us leave.
WILLIAM=>No, why the fuck are you here...in the jungle?
HARADA=>We’re heading to Bucari, Leon.
WILLIAM=>What’s there?
HARADA=>We were told it’s safe to go there.
DOLORES=>Who told you that?
HARADA=>The Japanese high command in the city.
DOLORES=>Bucari is 30 kilometers through the mountains. Also, you’re going in the wrong direction.
ITO=>Ask them.
WILLIAM=>What did he say?
HARADA=>We’re not safe being alone...can we go with you?
WILLIAM=>It’s strange how they end up here...they must know something.
DOLORES=>It’s difficult to take them but we can’t let them loose either. They know we’re here.
DOLORES=>We’ll hand them over to "Checkpoint Tango" first thing in the morning.
WILLIAM=>Okay, let’s clear them. I want to interrogate them in the church.
DOLORES=>You have this...but you’re way off your destination.
HARADA=>We were dropped off the road a few kilometers back. We paid a lumber truck to get us away from the city. This is as far as he can take us.
HARADA=>Right now, we’re just looking for a safe place to spend the night... We haven’t use that yet.
DOLORES=>Did you know that there’s a village nearby?
HARADA=>No...even if we knew we would have avoided it.
DOLORES=>Just for tonight, tomorrow we’ll drop you off a checkpoint. I’ll make sure you will be treated well.
SANTI=>Hurry...to the church!
DOLORES=>Japs?
SANTI=>Yes. Where is Emilio?
DOLORES=>We lost him.
SANTI=>Who are they?
DOLORES=>We don’t know yet! Inside, hurry!
DOLORES=>You, go with them. Don’t take your eyes off the Japs.
WILLIAM=>What is it?
HENRY=>Japs on the move.
DOLORES=>Where?
SANTI=>This is not right.
WILLIAM=>Who shot earlier?
SANTI=>Me and Rosa. Strange...because there is no way they could still be alive...but...they keep on running.
DOLORES=>What do you mean?
HENRY=>We saw Japs in the dark...they took shots but couldn’t bring ’em down.
WILLIAM=>Bad shot, you missed...then.
HENRY=>They didn’t miss. I saw it.
HENRY=>It’s a direct hit. I saw it too.
DOLORES=>How many?
DOLORES=>Okay, we advance the perimeter beyond those houses.
SANTI=>Wait!...They’re here again.
DOLORES=>What is going on...or she dies?
HARADA=>Calm down...please. Like I said, we know nothing about this.
DOLORES=>If they move, shoot them right away!
ROSARIO=>What is going on?
DOLORES=>Go inside, like I told you to.
ROSARIO=>No...no.
SANTI=>There...there!
ROSARIO=>Papa...Papa! No...
ROSARIO=>Let me fucking go! Papa!
ROSARIO=>Let go off me!
WILLIAM=>Fall back...fall back!
WILLIAM=>Maintain positions, maintain positions!
DOLORES=>Get ready!
DOLORES=>He’s still alive.
DOLORES=>We need you.
ROSARIO=>Blood can’t circulate to the head...this is serious.
ROSARIO=>Presión, Padre...presión!
ROSARIO=>Fight it!
ROSARIO=>No...no...no!
ROSARIO=>Hijo de puta!
DOLORES=>Stop it!
ROSARIO=>They know something! Why are they here in the first place?
DOLORES=>You want to know something...
ROSARIO=>My father and Bato just died...
DOLORES=>Do it the right way. Take him to the back.
DOLORES=>Open the door. Bring the Jap woman.
ROSARIO=>Let me do it.
HARADA=>Wait!
HARADA=>He knows something...I can get him to talk.
DOLORES=>Rosa...put your gun away.
ROSARIO=>You can’t...
DOLORES=>We need to get out of here...and maybe they know something we don’t.
ITO=>What are you doing? They’re bluffing.
HARADA=>Shut up and trust me.
HARADA=>Let me talk to him...please.
DOLORES=>You have five minutes to do that or the woman dies first.
HARADA=>You okay?
HARADA=>You have to tell them something.
ITO=>How sure are you that no one speaks Japanese here?
HARADA=>We’ll take our chances.
ITO=>Fuck...it hurts! Crazy bastards!
HARADA=>Listen...you have to talk.
ITO=>Takahashi is right...you are resilient.
HARADA=>Listen, we all need to get out of here alive.
ITO=>Not those bastards!
ITO=>I’ll kill myself first.
HARADA=>Listen to me...
HARADA=>The truth will affect their judgment and maybe...just maybe, I can get us out of here in one piece. I need to keep you alive. Do you understand?
ITO=>Fear of the unknown will affect their judgement anyway. On the other hand, I can make up a story.
SANTI=>Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over.
SANTI=>Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over. This is urgent...do you copy Alpha 3?
SANTI=>Echo 8 to Alpha 3, over. We have two men down Alpha 3...We need assistance...
HARADA=>He needs a smoke...and he’s talking.
HARADA=>In 1939, He was one of the head researchers at the vivisection department of Unit 731...in northern Manchuria. A research facility that experiments on biological and germ warfare.
HARADA=>One of us...in the vivisection group felt merciful to one of the "logs"... that’s what we call our "subjects," because the facility is covered up...as a lumber yard. We operate the "logs" without anesthesia because it would affect the growth of certain bacterias. But, a doctor injected it to one...out of mercy. He was severely punished for that.
ITO=>It turns out to be a redemption for that man because the bacteria thrive on...even with a foreign substance polluting it. With a few improvisation, we have come up with a germ that, rather kill people in big magnitude, tend to fortify their systems. So, we applied it to our troops instead. Thus, what you see outside.
DOLORES=>Human subjects...sick fucks! These things outside...are what he says they are.
HENRY=>In Leyte...a few weeks ago...there were suicide attacks on our fleet by Japs on a plane. They caught us by surprise. We took one fallen pilot just to dissect who they really are.
HENRY=>Humans...that’s what they are. Same as you and me...except that they’d go to extremes for their Emperor and country. Now, I don’t know what those are outside but I’m sure as hell they’re on the same team as the suicide pilots.
DOLORES=>This one is different. Humans don’t take a barrage of gunfire and still be alive.
WILLIAM=>What he didn’t say was how it affects the brain...the central nerve of the body. They act on primitive instincts to kill, like a pack of animals.
HENRY=>Strange...indeed.
DOLORES=>They’re very disorganized, we might have a way out of here.
DOLORES=>They’re on to something.
HENRY=>What now?
HENRY=>What’s with her?
WILLIAM=>What do you mean?
HENRY=>Who is she?
WILLIAM=>An amazon...and we need her on our side after the war is over.
HARADA=>Is it the truth?
ITO=>What do you think? Yes...I was the one who injected the anesthesia. I nearly got my head chopped off for treachery.
HARADA=>You said earlier that this operation was a success.
ITO=>"Promising"...the operation has potentials, that’s what I said. And, in the 36 hours of observation that I did in Manila, everything was going smooth.
HARADA=>What is it...the substance?
ITO=>A mind enhancing bacteria...rampant in rats.
HARADA=>Rats?
ITO=>It’s an accidental offshoot of our main study...the bubonic plague.
HARADA=>What have you done to these men?
ITO=>You’ll never get it.
HARADA=>And...they’re also after us?
ITO=>I don’t know yet. That’s why I was sent here...I wish I have one of them on my lab.
HARADA=>You crazy bastard! We might be victims too.
ITO=>What do you think those Americans will do if they discover something like that? ...The same fucking thing, maybe even worse!
ITO=>Looks like they’re on to something. Who’s she?
MICHIKO=>Dolores Crisostomo aka La Commandera. Most Filipinos think she is a mythical hero...Propaganda, that’s what...
HARADA=>Born from a rich family in the island of Negros. Story has it, that the Imperial Army left her entire clan in the middle of their sugarcane plantation and burned the whole field. She was rescued by a tribe of negritos...the only survior.
ITO=>Quite a story, a bit exaggerated.
HARADA=>She’s known to be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Japanese soldiers.
ITO=>What about him?
HARADA=>William Knox, sent by the O.S.S. as a combat adviser to Dolores. But, in reality, he’s here to match influences with the communists over her.
ITO=>They’ve briefed you well, I can see.
DOLORES=>What about you?
HARADA=>My wife owns a ramen house in the city, Togitsu Ramen. I told you about that.
WILLIAM=>Anybody heard about this place?
SANTI=>Yes, it’s at Plaza Libertad. Good place. I ate there a couple of times before the war. Now, it’s a hang out for Jap officials, collaborators and two-bit corrupt politicians.
WILLIAM=>You said you were in Berkeley.
HARADA=>Yes...I came here after the occupation. My father-in-law recommended that I work in the CONTINUE
WILLIAM=>What happened to the eatery?
HARADA=>It’s been vandalized by Filipinos two weeks ago. They threatened to kill us...leaving us with no place to go.
WILLIAM=>How did you know him?
HARADA=>He’s a regular customer. He said there’s a safe place for the "hojins" to go...and that’s Bucari.
WILLIAM=>Do you know any of this...this "project?"
HARADA=>Just about the same time you did.
HARADA=>If you let me...I can help.
DOLORES=>Rosario...there..she was raped by Japanese soldiers and forced to work as a comfort woman at 19. Before we rescued her, she vowed to kill your kind 10 times the men who
WILLIAM=>He might be able to help.
HENRY=>Dolores...
DOLORES=>Now...we wait.
NAPOLEON=>I can feel them moving, Sir.
WILLIAM=>Can you guess a head count?
NAPOLEON=>It’s hard in the dark, Sir. I was shooting at shadows earlier... maybe more than fifty.
NAPOLEON=>What’s he doing here?
WILLIAM=>He’s staying here with you...he’s gonna relay messages between us.
MARIO=>I can load bullets too.
NAPOLEON=>Look!
HARADA=>Daisuke...
HARADA=>Daisuke...Sato!
NAPOLEON=>Jesus Christ!
WILLIAM=>Somehow, they still have rational actions. That fucker is giving orders.
DOLORES=>We’ll see...two meters.
NAPOLEON=>Two meters?
WILLIAM=>Yes, two meters. Let’s see if these fuckers will kill their own.
WILLIAM=>Drop him!
DOLORES=>The door, Padre!
WILLIAM=>Cease fire! Cease fire!
DOLORES=>CEASE FIRE!
WILLIAM=>Who the fuck are you firing at?
WILLIAM=>Everybody, listen up...don’t shoot like fucking maniacs. Who knows how long we’ll be stuck in here? They’re vulnerable...but we won’t get out of here if we run out of bullets.
HARADA=>You happy now? Fucking maniacs!
DOLORES=>We wait ’til sunrise...then we go and fight our way out. It’s easier to shoot what you can see. These Japs don’t have any weapons...not a single gun was fired by them. They would also kill anyone.
SANTI=>We can make a run to the beach... at Commander Edgar’s checkpoint. It’s seven kilometers through the jungle.
DOLORES=>Are you okay?
FATHER MAURICIO=>We’re fine...don’t worry.
DOLORES=>You know...Padre...I really don’t believe...
FATHER MAURICIO=>That’s okay...my child.
DOLORES=>This is why...
FATHER MAURICIO=>I know you, Commandera. I heard
DOLORES=>What difference does it make, Padre? We may be acting accordingly in our own rights but some other fuckers across the world want to kill us all. It really doesn’t matter.
DOLORES=>Block the windows. Those shutters are not enough.
FATHER MAURICIO=>I have a hammer and some nails.
SANTI=>Let’s see what this Saint can do.
ROSARIO=>Help me.
ROSARIO=>What?
HARADA=>Where did this come from?
FATHER MAURICIO=>It’s from a young Japanese officer who died in the city clinic last month. I promised him that I would turn this over to somebody who can give it back to his wife.
FATHER MAURICIO=>War can be deceiving. In the end, it can make human beings out of us all.
DOLORES=>Rosa....it’s okay.
DOLORES=>Rosa!
DOLORES=>Everybody...okay? We’re gonna let go.
DOLORES=>Now!
DOLORES=>Together.
HARADA=>Wait!
NAPOLEON=>Where the fuck are they climbing?
DOLORES=>We go out the front door. We’ll fight it out...We’re sitting ducks here.
WILLIAM=>It’s useless.
WILLIAM=>To the front...move...move!
NAPOLEON=>Hurry up!
MARIO=>I am, I am!
NAPOLEON=>Go down!...now!
NAPOLEON=>4 seconds... fuck it!
WILLIAM=>Move back and stay together. Civilians in the middle.
DOLORES=>On my signal, loosen the door.
WILLIAM=>Stay in the middle.
DOLORES=>Santi, Napoleon...grenades...slip them through the door when I say.
WILLIAM=>Everyone stay behind the wall.
WILLIAM=>Stay put...don’t panic. Maintain perimeter. Head to the jungle slowly...make every shot count.
MICHIKO=>It’s too late...let it go.
WILLIAM=>Get ready!
MARIO=>Paolo!
WILLIAM=>Keep on moving. Go, go!
DOLORES=>Everybody down.
DOLORES=>What do you think?
WILLIAM=>We know what’s it like in the village. I’ll take my chances out there.
DOLORES=>You lead us to the river but stay within sight.
DOLORES=>We’re making a run for the jungle. Stay close and calm...don’t break your positions.
WILLIAM=>All here?
DOLORES=>Santi?
WILLIAM=>Shit!
DOLORES=>Who saw him last?
HARADA=>The guy with glases...he was behind me earlier.
DOLORES=>We can’t leave him behind.
WILLIAM=>The river...how far away is it?
DOLORES=>The negrito knows...I’m not leaving Santi behind.
ROSARIO=>They’re everywhere...I can feel it.
ROSARIO=>They’re everywhere! We’re all going to die.
HENRY=>Hey...look at me.
HENRY=>Look at me...listen! Nobody’s dying. We’re getting out of here.
DOLORES=>We’re not leaving without Santi.
HARADA=>Wait!
DOLORES=>What is it?
DOLORES=>My God! Santiago!
WILLIAM=>We need to move.
BALAS=>Too quiet. No sounds.
BALAS=>The ghosts are looking for a place to settle now.
DOLORES=>He thinks it’s not right.
WILLIAM=>We’re better off in the open. We’re gonna get hunted here.
WILLIAM=>Okay, let’s do a perimeter.
WILLIAM=>Rosario 20 meters, You, 10 meters.
WILLIAM=>20 meters and 10 meters. The rest in the middle.
WILLIAM=>We’ll take the front...on my signal.
WILLIAM=>Let’s move.
WILLIAM=>Fucking fog won’t clear up ’til sunrise...40 minutes maybe.
WILLIAM=>Fuck! It’s a trap! They used Santi!
DOLORES=>I can’t see anybody.
WILLIAM=>Shit! We have to get them in here.
MICHIKO=>What madness is this?
HARADA=>Calm down...don’t make any noise.
HARADA=>Calm down!
MICHIKO=>I can’t die here. Not like this...at the hands of our own.
HARADA=>Calm down or you’ll get us killed.
MICHIKO=>You know something about this...do you?
HARADA=>Shhhh, easy.
MICHIKO=>You bastard...you know about this...yet you dragged me here.
HARADA=>It’s okay, we’re gonna get out of here.
ROSARIO=>I can’t see.
HENRY=>Wait...stop!
ROSARIO=>I see one coming.
HENRY=>C’mon, let’s get out of here.
ROSARIO=>It’s meaningless now. We’re all going to die.
HENRY=>No...whatever you’re thinking...don’t do it.
ROSARIO=>I can’t...even if I wanted to.
BALAS=>Come...
NAPOLEON=>Did you hear the cries?
NAPOLEON=>Thought I heard it back there...but...there was nobody.
BALAS=>Down.
BALAS=>There...can you see?
DOLORES=>Nobody here.
WILLIAM=>It’s coming from the other side now.
DOLORES=>Where we were...earlier. Doesn’t make sense.
HARADA=>You have to snap out of it.
HARADA=>Listen to me...calm down or you’re going to get us killed.
MICHIKO=>K-k-killed? Death is all around...soon it will be all over...all over the place. Even in mighty Japan...my home. In my hometown. Take me home to Nagasaki.
MICHIKO=>Mother...take me to the bay where I
MICHIKO=>I belong to you...mother. So much life and growth in my hometown.
HARADA=>Damn it, woman! Keep quiet...stay down.
MARIO=>T-t-there.
HARADA=>Stand back.
DOLORES=>By the river bank.
MARIO=>Padre...Dolores. They’re there.
FATHER MAURICIO=>Okay let’s go...help me.
DOLORES=>We’re by the bank.
MARIO=>Padre this way...the voices are coming from...there.
DOLORES=>We’re by the bank...hurry.
MARIO=>Padre...they’re suppose to be here.
FATHER MAURICIO=>Dolores! Dolores!
DOLORES=>By the bank...Padre!
FATHER MAURICIO=>We are at the bank.
MARIO=>It sounds like they’re back in the jungle...where we came from. Padre...I’m scared.
HENRY=>The river bank...it’s just up ahead.
HENRY=>Shit! It’s impossible.
ROSARIO=>It can’t be. We just came here.
ROSARIO=>No...no more running. There’s nowhere left to go.
HENRY=>Watch my back.
HENRY=>Get down!
ROSARIO=>I’m out!
HENRY=>Fuck...fuck!
DOLORES=>Rosario...my God!
WILLIAM=>C’mon, let’s get the hell out of here.
HARADA=>They’re trying to isolate us...one by one.
DOLORES=>Where are the others?
HARADA=>I lost them.
WILLIAM=>The way you used that sword, you’re no ordinary "hojin." Speak up!
HARADA=>Most Japanese know how to use the samurai...even children.
WILLIAM=>You know more about this...and I can tell.
HARADA=>I don’t. All I know is that there’s more of them attacking soon.
DOLORES=>What about the priest and Mario?
HARADA=>I don’t know...they’re with Michiko. Now...I can be on my own or you can take me.
DOLORES=>Okay, you take us where you saw them.
WILLIAM=>I’ll be watching you.
FATHER MAURICIO=>Dolores!
DOLORES=>Get in the water!
WILLIAM=>Cross to the other side!
DOLORES=>Get out of here...now!
MARIO=>The water’s getting deeper. We can’t swim with this current.
FATHER MAURICIO=>I can’t swim at all...my son. This is as far as I can go.
MARIO=>Padre...don’t fight it. Padre!
MARIO=>Padre!
DOLORES=>No!
HARADA=>Michiko!
WILLIAM=>You two...go with the boy...I’ll
DOLORES=>No...I’m staying.
HENRY=>Fuck it!
WILLIAM=>Awright!
HENRY=>Oh my God!
DOLORES=>Stay with me on this, okay.
HENRY=>Whenever you’re ready.
DOLORES=>Get down...
MARIO=>No...please.
DOLORES=>...NOW!
HARADA=>Go!
HARADA=>Forgive me.
ITO=>I hate doing this without their permission, Colonel.
TAKAHASHI=>He is a good soldier...a just and brave one. In all likelihood that this will work, he would be the best candidate for it.
ITO=>He will feel a hundred percent better when he wakes up.
OLDER BOY=>Father!
