PRIEST=>What... does he... look like?
CATHERINE=>I'll be right here... I promise.
JEANNE=>I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
CHARLES=>My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
CHARLES=>So... pretend it's not a game.
CHARLES=>H-h-how did you know who I am?
TREMOILLE=>He needs to talk to her. Alone.
JEANNE=>Everything was moving so fast -- the wind -- the clouds -- I couldn't move! Then suddenly a shape appeared in the middle of the sky...
JEANNE=>Yes. I didn't confess today.
JEANNE=>I thought you were an archer?
TREMOILLE=>I can't believe you let her send such a letter...
XAINTRAILLES=>The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
DUNOIS=>Maybe they never sent anyone.
JEANNE=>Good. Where are the English?
JEANNE=>Follow me and I will give you victory!
LA HIRE=>Oh shit! Jeanne... don't die!
JEANNE=>Stop it! What are you doing?
SOLDIER=>Why not? He has good teeth...
JEANNE=>If you kill him, you kill me!
BISHOP=>What in heaven's name are you talking about?
AULON=>Jeanne...! Are you alright?
GILLES=>Jeanne... we're not enough...
JEANNE=>You don't believe me anymore?
YOLANDE=>Then her faith will have to be bigger.
CAUCHON=>Yes. They paid your ransom...
CHARLES=>It's a miracle she's not dead!
OLD PRIEST=>The verdict comes at the end of a trial, Cauchon, not at the beginning. I am going back to Rome, to give me report to our Holy Father the Pope.
CAUCHON=>Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne. On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved. And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say
JEANNE=>Yes... a half-steed... white.
BEAUPERE=>Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
JEAN MIDI=>Did your voice tell you to jump?
JEAN MIDI=>And you didn't jump of your free will?
JEANNE=>No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
BEAUPERE=>Didn't you also carry a banner?
CAUCHON=>Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
WOMAN=>But you've been sent by God!
BLACKBEARD=>Stop screaming like that! You'll wake up the whole bleedin' castle!
BLACKBEARD=>Ah, so you want to play it rough? Good... I like it better that way!
CAUCHON=>Jeanne, my very dear friend in Christ, we, your judges and assessors, desirous of reaching a true and lawful verdict, submitted a transcript of your trial to the University of Paris in order to obtain their opinion. After careful consideration, the learned scholars have concluded with us that you have committed many grievous sins, and I ask you to listen most carefully to their opinion as contained in these articles.
JEANNE=>No... I want to be confessed.
