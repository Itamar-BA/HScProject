1A=>Sweeping aerial shot of London, establishing the city in all its glory.
SHAZZER=>Is that his wife?
JUDE=>She’s pretty.
SUDDENLY DARCY LOOKS OVER.=>Bridget, aware of Darcy’s gaze, grabs onto random John’s arm.
BRIDGET=>Mum, it’s 6.00am!
HARD NEWS TITLES RUN.=>Miranda continues to talk to Bridget through her microphone.
FOOTAGE RUNS.=>Two young, hip and serious-looking professionals glide into the back of the studio; power-dressed ALICE PEABODY and her assistant. She watches proceedings sternly.
BRIDGET=>Yes. Pleased to...
BRIDGET=>Must not dwell on why the biological clock, though clearly ticking, has not compelled me yet to Colombia, or Olly Husbands Bosworth’s sperm, or even into the arms of inappropriate men met on Internet. Always thought I’d find love of my life and then baby would follow. I may be old of womb, but will remain young at heart. Will start to embrace life in manner of thirty-something friends like Miranda, who don’t seem to care about settling, or babies, or ticking clocks.
BRIDGET=>Thank you... I....
INTERVIEWER=>And he’s also sponsoring this festival.
JACK=>Guess I scared her off.
JACK=>A couple more.
JACK=>Is this off the agenda?
BRIDGET=>Without question.
BRIDGET=>Gangnam? Dancing.
BRIDGET.=>Mark. I’m so sorry.
BRIDGET=>Mark Darcy. Wow.
BRIDGET=>So you won’t stop.
DAYTIME TELEVISION AWARDS’=>Bridget stands alone on the steps of the imposing building. She is holding her award. She is looking up and down the road, as if waiting for someone to arrive. The last of the event’s attendees trickle down the steps, one or two of them congratulating her as they pass. Finally, she walks down the steps, alone and sad, and stands waiting on the pavement. At the sound of a car, she looks up and smiles with relief and delight, as if seeing someone she knows. E N D M O N T A G E.
ALICE=>Cue Hitler Cats!
RICHARD FINCH=>Brilliant, zoom in on 4.
DR. RAWLINGS=>I’m glad you’ve decided on the amniocentesis.
BRIDGET=>I know that looks like a cat, but it is in fact a helicopter.
DOWN!...=>... You’re always ill, you can’t go out, you’re covered in a constant layer of sick, wee, old food and poo, there’s no time to wash, and anyway there’s no point because you don’t see anybody and you will never have sex again - Giles tried the other night and apart from the fact that when he pulled off the duvet I looked like I still had it on, I couldn’t feel anything - not a thing because it’s a wind-tunnel down there, he said it was like the Hadron fucking Collider and as for my nipples -
JUDE=>No, thank you. That was good to get off my chest.
110A=>Bridget is sitting preparing her presentation on her Laptop.
BRIDGET=>I could have told him then, of course, but suddenly the possibility of a life of spontaneous takeaway and flat pack furniture seemed sort of inviting...Bit of a pity to ruin it and we wouldn’t want my neck going all blotchy again... I’m going to tell them both tomorrow. Definitely. Without a shadow of a doubt.
BRIDGET=>Mark, I wonder whether you might give us a second.
JACK=>A boy. My boy.
ON THE SCREEN:=>HOW CAN I MAKE MY THIGHS LOOK THINNER?
HARRY STYLES NAKED.=>HOW CAN I MAKE MY BOSS LIKE ME? HOW CAN I GET MY BOSS FIRED? HOW CAN I FIND OUT WHO IS THE FATHER OF MY CHILD? The crowd are mesmerized by the searches. Bridget blissfully unaware. She then looks behind, sees the searches. Is horrified.
MUM=>Don’t be sarcastic Colin. Add it to the minutes.
MUM=>Here, this is a lovely place for you to stand.
MARK=>Right, do you want me to carry your phone for you?
126AA=>Bridget is working intently at her desk. She gets a pain and reaches for her stomach. She looks around for help, all the hipsters are busy working away at their stations wearing oversized headphones, oblivious to her.
BRIDGET=>So essentially...
126BA=>Dr. Rawlings enters the waiting room and sees Mark Darcy at reception. Mark approaches Dr. Rawlings.
126F=>INT. HOSPITAL MAIN RECEPTION. STAIRCASE. DAY Bridget comes down the stairs. She sees Mark and Jack still arguing.
MARK=>It’s alright Bridget.
139A=>A pensive Bridget, looking a bit breezier is walking along a street, shopping for the baby.
JACK=>Mark thinks the baby isn’t his. I let him believe it was mine...that’s why he disappeared.
MUM=>Make way! Make Way! Pregnant single mother coming through.
161A=>EXT/INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT. SAME TIME. DAY. Mark and his wife enter the airport with the suitcases. They pause at the departures board.
BRIDGET=>Oh, no! Please no.
BRIDGET=>Camilla. I came round to find you and she was there.
LATER=>Bridget lets out a blood curdling scream, she is clearly in huge pain. Both men simultaneously put out their hands for support, but as she screams, just as the pain appears that it might be too much and faced with the choice of the two men in her life, impulsively, instinctively, she reaches for...
MARK.=>Jack sees this and realizes that Bridget has made her choice. As Bridget clings to Mark, the two men share a look. Jack gives a conciliatory and defeated nod then quietly, graciously, withdraws from the room. Oblivious to this, Bridget continues to squeeze Mark’s hand with superhuman might. He swallows his anguish and puts his face in front of Bridget so she can see him.
174A LATER=>It’s early morning after what has clearly been a long night. Jack and Mark are fast asleep in the waiting room chairs. Jack’s head resting on Mark’s shoulder. Suddenly there is a huge cry like a great lion’s roar. They wake up with a start, and whirl round to look at the door. Seconds later, the mewl of a new-born babe.
BRIDGET=>Alright then, William X X. Hashtagletsdothis!
