FIRST SENATOR=>Another of his fathom we have none.
IAGO=>Are your doors locked?
BRABANTIO=>What, have you lost your wits?
BRABANTIO=>What profane wretch art thou?
BRABANTIO=>My daughter! O, my daughter!
OTHELL=>O true I have married her;
RODERIGO=>What will I do, think'st thou?
RODERIGO=>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?
CASSIO=>He hath achieved a maid, That paragons descriptions and wild fame, One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens, And in the essential vesture of creation Does bear all excellency.
ALL=>Heaven bless this isle.
IAGO=>Lechery, by this hand:
CASSIO=>She is indeed perfection.
OTHELLO=>Amen to that, sweet powers.
IAGO=>Touch me not so near. I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.
IAGO=>Exclaim more against it. And good Lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
CASSIO=>Good night, honest Iago.
IAGO=>Cassio hath beaten thee, And thou by that small hurt hath cashiered Cassio.
IAGO=>Content thyself awhile.
CASSIO=>Madam, I take my leave.
OTHELLO=>Nay, yet there's more in this. I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words.
OTHELLO=>I am bound to thee forever.
IAGO=>But pardon me: I do not in position Distinctly speak of her, tho' I may fear Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, May fall to match you with her country forma And may perchance repent.
IAGO=>To have a foolish wife.
IAGO=>I am sorry to hear this.
IAGO=>Is't possible, my lord?
IAGO=>I do not like the office; But sith I am entered in this cause so far Pricked to it by foolish honesty and love I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately, And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep. There are a kind of men so loose of soul That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio. In sleep I heard him say, 'Sweet Desdemona, Lot us be wary, let us hide our loves.'
DESDEMONA=>Believe me, I had rather lose my purse
OTHELLO=>Look how he laughs already.
IAGO=>I am a very villain else.
IAGO=>I am your own forever.
LODOVICO=>God save you, worthy general.
LODOVICO=>Maybe the letter moved him; For as I think they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government.
OTHELLO=>You have seen nothing then?
OTHELLO=>there's money for your pains. I pray you turn the key, and keep our counsel.
IAGO=>What name fair lady?
IAGO=>It is but so, I warrant.
IAGO=>What in the contrary?
DESDEMONA=>This Lodovico is a proper man.
IAGO=>Did not you hear a cry?
CASSIO=>Iago? Give me some help.
IAGO=>O, treacherous villains.
EMILIA=>O, fie upon thee, strumpet.
EMILIA=>As I? Foh! Fie upon thee.
DESDEMONA=>Will you come to bed, my lord?
OTHELLO=>Being done, there is no pause.
EMILIA=>O Lord. What cry is that?
EMILIA=>Thou art rash as fire to say That she was false. O, she was heavenly true.
EMILIA=>Villainy, villainy, villainy. I think upon it , I think – I smell't – O villainy.
OTHELLO=>Or she was foul. Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it, And she did gratify his amorous works With that same handkerchief. I saw it in his hand:
OTHELLO=>Are there no stones in heaven But what serves for thunder? Precious villain.
