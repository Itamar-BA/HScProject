[SCENE=>Germania - prebattle. As the cavalry rides past Maximus, soldiers are lining up for battle. Maximus walks along the ranks of the army. The soldiers rise as he approaches, looking at him with great respect and admiration. At the top of the hill, overlooking the battle field, sits Caesar Marcus Aurelius atop his horse, surrounded by the Roman Praetorian guards. Back on the battle field, Maximus approaches and addresses Quintus and Valerius.]
MAXIMUS=>Lean and hungry. Still nothing?
QUINTUS=>Not a sign.
MAXIMUS=>How long has he been gone?
VALERIUS=>Nearly 2 hours.
VALERIUS=>Will they fight, sir?
MAXIMUS=>We shall know soon enough.
QUINTUS=>Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward, they're out of range.
MAXIMUS=>Range is good.
QUINTUS=>The danger to the cavalry...
MAXIMUS=>[interrupts] It is acceptable, agreed?
MAXIMUS=>They say no.
GERMAN BARBARIAN=>Ihr seid verfluchte hunde!
QUINTUS=>People should know when they're conquered.
MAXIMUS=>Would you, Quintus? Would I?
MAXIMUS=>Strength and honour.
QUINTUS=>Strength and honour.
VALERIUS=>Strength and honour.
MAXIMUS=>At my signal, unleash hell.
QUINTUS=>Load the catapults; infantry form up for advance...archers ready.
CHIEF ARCHER=>Archers!
CENTURION=>Nock!
ARCHER=>Nock!
MAXIMUS=>Fratres..., three weeks from now I will be harvesting my crops, imagine where you will be and it will be so. Hold the lines, stay with me. If you find yourself alone riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium and you're already dead!!!. [The men laugh.] Brothers, what we do in life echoes in eternity.
ONAGER CENTURION=>Pull, Pull!
SHOUT=>Cohorts, ready sir!
ONAGER CENTURION=>Loose!
MAXIMUS=>Hold the line!
SOLDIER=>Make ready.
MAXIMUS=>Hold the line!
MAXIMUS=>Stay with me! Stay with me!
MAXIMUS=>Roma victa!
CENTURION=>Roma victa!
COMMODUS=>Do you think he's really dying?
LUCILLA=>He's been dying for ten years.
COMMODUS=>If he weren't really dying he wouldn't have sent for us.
LUCILLA=>Maybe he just misses us.
COMMODUS=>And the Senators...he wouldn't have summoned them if....
LUCILLA=>Peace, Commodus. After two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head.
COMMODUS=>He's made his decision, he's going to announce it! He will name me.... The first thing I shall do...when...is honour him with games worthy of his majesty.
LUCILLA=>For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.
ATTENDANT=>We look to be almost there, Sire. [A battle weary soldier approaches the wagon] Sire.
COMMODUS=>Where's the Emperor?
SOLDIER=>At the front, Sire. They've been gone for 19 days. The wounded are still coming in.
MARCUS=>You have proved your valour yet again, Maximus. Let us hope, for the last time.
MAXIMUS=>There is no one left to fight, Sire.
MARCUS=>There is always someone left to fight, Maximus. Tell me, how can I reward Rome's greatest General?
MAXIMUS=>Let me go home?
MARCUS=>Ahh. Home.
MAXIMUS=>They honour you, Caesar.
MARCUS=>It is you, Maximus. They honour you.
MARCUS=>You have missed the war.
COMMODUS=>Congratulations. I shall sacrifice 100 bulls to honour your triumph.
MARCUS=>Save the bulls, honour Maximus. He won the battle.
COMMODUS=>General.
MAXIMUS=>Highness.
COMMODUS=>Rome salutes you and I embrace you as a brother. It has been too long old friend.
MAXIMUS=>Highness. [Maximus with head bowed. Commodus turns to his father.]
COMMODUS=>Here, father, take my arm.
MARCUS=>I think it is time...for me to leave.
MARCUS=>[to Maximus] So much for the glory of Rome.
QUINTUS=>General!
MAXIMUS=>Still alive?
QUINTUS=>Still alive.
MAXIMUS=>The gods must have a sense of humour.
QUINTUS=>The gods must love you.
VALERIUS=>Back to your barracks, General, or to Rome?
MAXIMUS=>Home. The wife, the son, the harvest.
QUINTUS=>Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.
MAXIMUS=>You know, Quintus, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood.
COMMODUS=>[As he approaches Maximus,] Here he is.
MAXIMUS=>Highness.
COMMODUS=>[Making introductions,] Senator Gaius, Senator Falco. Beware of Gaius, he will pour honeyed potion in your ear and you will wake up one day and all you'll say is Republic! Republic! Republic!
GAIUS=>Well, Rome WAS founded as a Republic.
COMMODUS=>Yes and in a republic, the senate has the power. But Senator Gaius is not influenced by that, of course.
FALCO=>Where do you stand General? Emperor or Senate?
MAXIMUS=>A soldier has the advantage of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.
GAIUS=>You know, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.
COMMODUS=>I warned you, but I shall save you. Senators. [He pulls Maximus away and they leave the Senators. Commodus continues his conversation with Maximus.] I'm going to need good men like you.
COMMODUS=>You are a man who knows what it is to command. You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won. But these senators, they scheme and squabble and flatter and deceive. Maximus we must save Rome from the politicians. [Glancing over to Marcus and back to Maximus.] Can I count on you, when the time comes?
MAXIMUS=>[Following Commodus' glance, he looks at Marcus and back to Commodus.] Highness, when your father releases me I intend to return home.
COMMODUS=>Home, well no one has earned it more. Don't get too comfortable - I may call on you before long. Lucilla is here - did you know? [A look of concern over Commodus' remarks about future service, followed with surprise about Lucilla overcome Maximus as Commodus continues....] She has not forgotten you. And now you are the great man.
MARCUS=>If only you had been born a man. What a Caesar you would have made.
LUCILLA=>Father [as she walks to him and kisses his cheek]
MARCUS=>You would have been strong. I wonder, would you have been just.
LUCILLA=>I would have been what you taught me to be.
MARCUS=>Oh. How was your journey?
LUCILLA=>Long - uncomfortable. Why have I come?
MARCUS=>I need your help...with your brother.
LUCILLA=>Of course.
MARCUS=>He loves you, he always has and... he will need you now, more than ever. [A contemplative pause by Marcus and he continues as they walk arm in arm....] Enough of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I am a good father.
LUCILLA=>This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?
MAXIMUS=>You sent for me Caesar? [No response. Maximus turns to look at the weak and old Marcus.] Caesar?
MAXIMUS=>For the glory of the empire, Sire.
MARCUS=>Ah yes, ah yes. I remember. You see that map, Maximus? That is the world which I created. For 25 years, I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire. Since I became Caesar I have known 4 years without war - 4 years of peace in 20. And for what? [He rises.] I brought the sword, nothing more.
MAXIMUS=>Caesar, your life...
MARCUS=>Please, please don't call me that. Come, please, come sit. Let us talk now, together now. Very simply, as men. Well, Maximus, talk.
MAXIMUS=>5,000 of my men are out there in the freezing mud. 3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved. 2,000 will never leave this place. I will not believe they fought and died for nothing.
MARCUS=>And what would you believe?
MAXIMUS=>They fought for YOU and for Rome.
MARCUS=>And what is Rome, Maximus?
MAXIMUS=>I have seen much of the rest of the world. It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.
MARCUS=>Yet you have never been there. You have not seen what it has become. I am dying, Maximus. When a man sees his end he wants to know that there has been some purpose to his life. How will the world speak my name in years to come? Will I be known as the philosopher, the warrior, the tyrant. Or will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her true self? There was once a dream that was Rome, you could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish. It was so fragile and I fear that it will not survive the winter. Maximus, let us whisper now. Together, you and I. You have a son? [Maximus nods.] Tell me about your home.
MAXIMUS=>My house is in the hills above Trujillo. Very simple place, pink stones that warm in the sun. Kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day, jasmine in the evening. Through the gate is a giant poplar. Figs, apples, pears. The soil, Marcus, black ...black like my wife's hair. [Marcus warmly laughs with Maximus] Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north. Wild ponies play near my house, they tease my son. He wants to be one of them.
MARCUS=>Maximus, when was the last time you were home?
MAXIMUS=>2 years, 264 days and this morning.
MARCUS=>I envy you, Maximus. It is a good home. Worth fighting for? [Maximus nods yes and Marcus rises.] There is one more duty that I ask of you before you go home.
MAXIMUS=>What will you have me do, Caesar?
MARCUS=>I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die. I will empower you, to one end alone, to give power back to the people of Rome and end the corruption that has crippled it. [Shock and bewilderment overcome Maximus. He tries to keep from displaying these feelings. Hearing no response, Marcus continues.] Will you accept this great honour that I have offered?
MAXIMUS=>With all my heart, no.
MAXIMUS=>But surely a prefect, a senator, somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics....
MARCUS=>But you have not been corrupted by her politics.
MAXIMUS=>And Commodus?
MARCUS=>Commodus is not a moral man, you have known that since you were young. Commodus cannot rule. He must not rule. You are the son that I should have had. Commodus will accept my decision. He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.
MAXIMUS=>[Nearly speechless]
MARCUS=>Yes. By sunset, I hope, you will have agreed. Now embrace me as my son and bring an old man another blanket.
LUCILLA=>My father favours you now.
MAXIMUS=>M'lady.
LUCILLA=>T'was not always so.
MAXIMUS=>Many things change.
LUCILLA=>Many things, not everything. [Maximus turns to leave.] Maximus, stop. Let me see your face. You seem upset.
MAXIMUS=>I lost many men.
LUCILLA=>What did my father want with you?
MAXIMUS=>To wish me well before I leave for home. [Again, he turns to leave.]
LUCILLA=>You are lying. I could always tell when you were lying because you were never any good at it.
MAXIMUS=>I never acquired your comfort with it.
LUCILLA=>True. But then you never had to. Life is more simpler for a soldier. Or do you think me heartless?
MAXIMUS=>I think you have a talent for survival. [Again, he turns to leave. Lucilla laughs, wanting to prolong their time together.]
LUCILLA=>Maximus, stop. Is it really so terrible seeing me again?
MAXIMUS=>No. I am tired from battle.
LUCILLA=>It hurts you to see my father so fragile. [Maximus nods.]
LUCILLA=>Commodus expects my father to announce succession within days. Will you serve my brother as you have served my father?
MAXIMUS=>I will always serve Rome.
LUCILLA=>You know, I still remember you in my prayers. Oh, yes I pray.
MAXIMUS=>I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him.
LUCILLA=>Thank you.
MAXIMUS=>And I hear you have a son.
LUCILLA=>Yes, Lucius. He will be nearly 8 years old.
MAXIMUS=>My son is also nearly 8. [Again, a moment of peace overcomes him as he speaks of his family.] I thank you for your prayers. [Maximus leaves Lucilla as she stands alone, looking after him.]
MAXIMUS=>Ancestors, I ask you for your guidance. Blessed Mother, come to me with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword. Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again. Ancestors, I honour you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. [Maximus tenderly and longingly kisses the figurine of his wife, stands and moves to sit on a chair as he calls to his friend and servant, Cicero.]
MAXIMUS=>Cicero. Do you find it hard to do your duty?
CICERO=>Sometimes I do what I want to do. The rest of the time I do what I have to.
MAXIMUS=>[rubbing his beard]
MARCUS=>Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?
COMMODUS=>[with a slight smile on his face]
MARCUS=>You will not be Emperor.
COMMODUS=>[the smile quickly vanishes leaving in its place painful bewilderment]
MARCUS=>My powers will pass to Maximus to hold in trust until the Senate is ready to rule once more. Rome is to be a Republic again.
COMMODUS=>Maximus?
MARCUS=>My decision disappoints you?
COMMODUS=>You wrote to me once, listing the four chief virtues -- wisdom, justice, fortitude, and temperance. As I read the list I knew I had none of them. But I have other virtues, Father -- ambition, that can be a virtue when it drives us to excel; resourcefulness; courage, perhaps not on the battle field but there are many forms of courage; devotion, to my family, to you. But none of my virtues were on your list. Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.
MARCUS=>Oh, Commodus, you go too far.
MARCUS=>Commodus, [he kneels in front of his son] your faults as a son, is my failure as a father. [He stretches his arms out to Commodus, seeking forgiveness. Commodus slowly embraces him, together they weep]
COMMODUS=>Father, I would butcher the whole world if you would only loved me!!!
QUINTUS=>Maximus. The Emperor needs you. It is urgent.
COMMODUS=>Lament with me, brother. Our great father is dead.
COMMODUS=>The surgeon said there was no pain. His breath gave out as he slept.
COMMODUS=>Your Emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus. Take my hand. I only offer it once.
LUCILLA=>Hail Caesar.
QUINTUS=>Maximus, please be careful, that was not prudent.
MAXIMUS=>Prudent! The Emperor has been slain.
QUINTUS=>The Emperor died of natural causes.
MAXIMUS=>Quintus, why are you armed?
QUINTUS=>Guards! [The guards quickly enter, spinning Maximus around as they secure him.] Maximus please do not fight. I am sorry, Caesar has spoken.
QUINTUS=>Ride him until dawn and then execute him.
MAXIMUS=>Quintus, look at me. Look at me! Promise me that you will look after my family.
QUINTUS=>Your family will meet you in the after life.
MAXIMUS=>The frost. Sometimes it makes the blade stick. [With a roar, Maximus swings the sword at the guard, cutting him across the face, killing him. Another guard, on horse, moves forward and the swishing sound of the sword can be heard as it comes spinning through the air, striking the guard dead. Maximus turns to the remaining guard who is on horse, drinking from a bottle of whiskey to warm himself from the cold. Maximus cries out, "Praetorian!" The Praetorian turns to see Maximus standing with a sword, tosses down the bottle and rides at him but Maximus swings his sword as the Praetorian passes. Maximus stands ready to fight again, but the Praetorian falls from his horse, having been fatally wounded. Maximus has been severely wounded to the arm. Having killed each of the Praetorian, Maximus takes two horses for his long journey home.]
SLAVE TRADER=>Proximo, old friend. Today is your most fortunate day.
PROXIMO=>Those giraffes you sold me, they won't mate. They just walk around eating, not mating. You sold me queer giraffes. I want my money back.
SLAVE TRADER=>Not a chance. [He grunts as Proximo squeezes tighter.] I'll give do special price for you!
PROXIMO=>On what?
SLAVE TRADER=>Have you seen my new stock? Come and see them.
PROXIMO=>Do any of them fight? I have a match coming up.
SLAVE TRADER=>Some are good for fighting, others for dying. You need both, I think.
PROXIMO=>What was your trade?
JUBA=>I was a hunter.
SLAVE TRADER=>No, no, I bought him from a salt mine in Carthage. [The slave trader quickly and nervously tells him to sit down. Proximo continues to inspect the other slaves.]
PROXIMO=>[Maximus sits on the dirt, weak and lifeless. Proximo pokes at his gashed arm alongside the SPQR insignia]
SLAVE TRADER=>Maybe. Who cares? He's a Spaniard.
PROXIMO=>I will take 6 for 1,000.
SLAVE TRADER=>1,000?! The Numidian alone is worth 2,000!
PROXIMO=>These slaves are rotten!
SLAVE TRADER=>It adds to the flavour!
SLAVE TRADER=>No, no, wait, wait, wait! We can negotiate.
PROXIMO=>I'll give you 2,000 and another 4 for the beasts. That's 5,000 for an old friend.
PROXIMO=>Come on, how long does it take to get into my own house?
PROXIMO=>I am Proximo. I shall be closer to you for the next few days, which will be the last of your miserable lives, than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world. I did not pay good money for you for your company, I paid it so that I could profit from your death and as your mother was there at your beginning, so I shall be there at your end. And when you die, and die you shall, your transition shall be to the sound of [applauding] ...Gladiators, I salute you.
HAGEN=>Good.
PROXIMO=>Red [Juba looks at Hagen with honour at having won red.]
HAGEN=>Spaniard! [Maximus curiously looks at Hagen, walks up and tosses the sword to the ground --Maximus refuses to fight. With Proximo's approval, Hagen slams his sword into Maximus' stomach causing Maximus to collapse, but he stands back up in defiance. Hagen hits him a second time and Maximus falls to the ground. Proximo stops Hagen as he is about to make the third blow, calling out "That is enough for the moment. His time will come." Maximus looks at Hagen with a slight grin and turns and walks away.]
HAGEN=>Next.
JUBA=>Spaniard, why don't you fight? We all have to fight. [Maximus looks at Juba, as he continues to scrape the Legion Mark from his arm with a sharp stone. The pain of his efforts clearly read in his expression.]
JUBA=>Is that a sign of your gods?
JUBA=>Will that not anger them?
HAGEN=>[to Maximus]
GRACCHUS=>He enters Rome like a conquering hero. But what has he conquered?
FALCO=>Give him time. He's young. I think he could do very well.
GRACCHUS=>For Rome or for you?
GRACCHUS=>Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she would want.
LUCIUS=>Mother!
LUCILLA=>Lucius. [Lucius and Lucilla embrace.]
COMMODUS=>Senators.
FALCO=>Rome greets her new Emperor. Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.
COMMODUS=>Thank you, Falco, and for the loyal subjects. I trust they were not too expensive.
GRACCHUS=>Rome rejoices in your return. There are many matters that require your attention.
GRACCHUS=>Caesar, the Senate has prepared a series of protocol to address the many problems in the city, beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek quarter to combat the plague which is already springing up there. So... [As Gracchus continues with his speech, Commodus interrupts him....]
COMMODUS=>Shhhhhh. Don't you see Gracchus. That's the very problem, isn't it. My father spent all his time at study, reading books, learning his philosophy. He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate. All the while, the people were forgotten.
GRACCHUS=>The Senate is the people, Sire, chosen from the people, to speak for the people.
COMMODUS=>I doubt if many people eat so well as you do, Gracchus, or have such splendid mistresses as you, Gaius. I think I understand my own people.
GRACCHUS=>Perhaps Caesar would be so kind as to teach us, out of his own extensive experience. [A slight laughter from the Senators is heard.]
COMMODUS=>I call it love. The people are my children and I their father. I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly....
GRACCHUS=>[as he interrupts]
COMMODUS=>No. But if you interrupt me again, I assure you that you shall. [He leaves the Senate and returns to the palace.]
LUCILLA=>Senator, my brother is very tired. Leave the list with me. Your Emperor will do all that Rome requires.
GRACCHUS=>My lady, as always your lightest touch commands obedience.
COMMODUS=>Who are they to lecture me?
LUCILLA=>Commodus, the senate has its uses.
COMMODUS=>What uses? All they do is talk. It should be just and you, and Rome.
LUCILLA=>Don't even think it, Commodus. There has always been a senate....
COMMODUS=>Rome has changed. It takes an Emperor to rule an empire.
LUCILLA=>Of course, but leave the people their....
COMMODUS=>Illusions?.
LUCILLA=>...traditions.
COMMODUS=>My father's war against the barbarians, he said himself it achieved nothing. But people still loved him.
LUCILLA=>People always love victories.
COMMODUS=>But why? They don't see the battles? What do they care about Germania?
LUCILLA=>They care about the greatness of Rome.
COMMODUS=>Greatness of Rome? But what is that?
LUCILLA=>It's an idea, greatness. Greatness is a vision.
COMMODUS=>Exactly. A vision. Do you not see, Lucilla? I will give the people a vision and they will love me for it. They will soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men. I will give them the greatest vision of their lives.
GAIUS=>Games! 150 days of games!
GRACCHUS=>He's cleverer than I thought.
GAIUS=>Clever? The whole of Rome would be laughing at him if they weren't in fear of his Praetorian.
GRACCHUS=>Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.
GAIUS=>Will the people really be seduced by that?
GRACCHUS=>I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. He will conjure magic for them and they will be distracted. He will take away their freedom, and still they will roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate, it is the sand of the Colosseum. He will give them death, and they will love him for it.
PROXIMO=>What do you want? Hmmmm? Girl? Boy?
MAXIMUS=>You sent for me? [Standing straight, as though at attention.]
PROXIMO=>Yes I did. You are good, Spaniard, but you're not that good. You could be magnificent.
MAXIMUS=>I am required to kill so I kill. That is enough.
PROXIMO=>That's enough for the provinces but not for Rome [as he feeds his caged hyena] . The young Emperor has arranged a series of spectacles to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius. I find that amusing since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise, the all knowing Marcus Aurelius, who closed us down. So finally after 5 years of scratching a living in flea infested villages we are finally going back to where we belong, the Colosseum. [He breaths deeply, as though he could smell the Colosseum.] Oh you should see the Colosseum, Spaniard. 50,000 Romans watching every movement of your sword, willing you to make the killer blow. The silence before you strike, and the noise afterwards, it rises, rises up like...like...like a storm, as though you were the Thunder God himself.
MAXIMUS=>You were a gladiator?
PROXIMO=>Yes, I was [responding nervously but proudly in the memory of his time gone by]
MAXIMUS=>You won your freedom?
PROXIMO=>Long time ago the old emperor Marcus Aurelius presented me with a Rudius - it's just a wooden sword, a symbol for your freedom. He touched me on the shoulder once, and I was free.
MAXIMUS=>You knew Marcus Aurelius? [Maximus asks loudly, laughing as he speaks, doubting that Proximo could have known such a man.]
PROXIMO=>I did not say that I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once.
MAXIMUS=>You asked me what I want. I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor, as you did.
PROXIMO=>Then listen to me. Learn from me. I wasn't the best because I killed quickly. I was the best because the crowd loved me. Win the crowd, win your freedom.
MAXIMUS=>I will win the crowd. I will give them something they have never seen before.
PROXIMO=>Haaa! So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together and have bloody adventures and the great whore will suckle us until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more. And then, when enough men have died, perhaps you will have your freedom. Here, use this.... [Proximo tosses Maximus a body shield of armour. As Maximus leaves, Proximo turns to look out the window, raising his arms in jubilee.]
JUBA=>It is somewhere out there, my country, my home. My wife is preparing food. My daughters carry water from the river. Will I ever see them again. I think not.
MAXIMUS=>Do you believe that you will see them again when you die?
JUBA=>I think so, but then, I will die soon. They will not die for many years. I will have to wait.
MAXIMUS=>But you would...wait?
JUBA=>Of course.
MAXIMUS=>You see, my wife and my son are already waiting for me.
JUBA=>You will meet them again. But not yet. [Juba takes Maximus' hand as if to assure him that the time will come.] Not yet.
MAXIMUS=>Not yet. Not yet.
JUBA=>Did you ever see anything like that before? I didn't know man could build such things.
PROXIMO=>[He walks towards the gladiators, looking at Maximus]
COMMODUS=>He sleeps so well because he is loved.
LUCILLA=>Come brother, it is late.
COMMODUS=>I will make Rome the wonder of the ages. That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand. All my desires are splitting my head into pieces.
COMMODUS=>I think the time is almost right? I could announce the dissolution of the senate in celebration of our father. Do you think I should...are the people are ready?
LUCILLA=>I think you need your rest now.
COMMODUS=>Will you stay with me?
LUCILLA=>Still afraid of the dark, brother?
COMMODUS=>Still? Always. Stay with me tonight?
LUCILLA=>You know I won't.
COMMODUS=>Then kiss me. [She kisses his forehead.]
LUCILLA=>Sleep, brother.
PROXIMO=>The Emperor wants battles and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters.
CASSIUS=>The crowd wants battles so the Emperor gives them battles. You get the battle of Carthage.
PROXIMO=>The massacre of Carthage! Why don't you get the beggars and thieves from the prison?
CASSIUS=>We've done that.
PROXIMO=>If you're going to give away the best gladiators in the empire, then I want double the rates.
CASSIUS=>You will get your contract rates or you will get your contract canceled. If you don't like it, you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from.
LUCIUS=>Gladiator, are you the one they call Spaniard?
MAXIMUS=>Yes.
LUCIUS=>They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.
MAXIMUS=>Man's? No. A boy's... [he says, teasingly]
MAXIMUS=>Some of the best. This is Argento. This is Scarto [pointing to each horse] . They were my horses. They were taken from me?.
LUCIUS=>I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.
MAXIMUS=>They let you watch the games?
LUCIUS=>My uncle says it makes me strong.
MAXIMUS=>And what does your father say?
LUCIUS=>My father is dead.
SERVANT=>Master Lucius, it is time.
LUCIUS=>I have to go.
MAXIMUS=>Your name is Lucius?
LUCIUS=>Lucius Verus. After my father. [Realizing he has come closer to Commodus, Maximus withdraws into the corner, looking to see who might be in the crowd.]
CASSIUS=>[the orator]
MAXIMUS=>Anyone here been in the army?
MAXIMUS=>You can help me. Whatever comes out of these gates, we have a better chance of survival if we work together. Do you understand? We stay together, we survive.
COMMODUS=>My history's a little hazy Cassius, but aren't the Barbarians supposed to lose the battle of Carthage!!
CASSIUS=>Yes, Sire. Forgive me, Sire.
COMMODUS=>No, I rather enjoy surprises. Who is that?
CASSIUS=>They call him the Spaniard, Sire.
COMMODUS=>I think I'll meet him.
CASSIUS=>Yes, Sire.
PRAETORIAN=>Drop your weapons.
PRAETORIAN=>Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.
MAXIMUS=>I'm at the Emperor's service.
COMMODUS=>Rise, rise.
COMMODUS=>Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard. I don't think there has been a gladiator to match you, as for this young man [Commodus cradling Lucius in front him] , he insists you are Hector reborn, or was it Hercules. Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name. You do have a name...?
MAXIMUS=>My name is gladiator.
COMMODUS=>How dare you show your back to me, SLAVE. You will remove your helmet and tell me your name... [The Praetorian take a ready-stand, and the gladiators, without weapons, move forward ready to fight with Maximus. Maximus stops, takes a deep breath, removes his helmet, and turns to face Commodus.]
MAXIMUS=>My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the armies of the North, general of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance in this life or the next.
CROWD=>Live, Live, Live, Live...!
COMMODUS=>Shhh! [--in an effort to calm the people. Commodus extends his hand, struggling to give the thumbs up for he would much prefer to give the thumbs down. Extending his thumb up, to the pleasure and cheers of the crowd, Commodus turns and leaves, sending a look to Maximus as though to say this is not over, and the Praetorian leave, as well. As Maximus looks at Quintus, he holds his fist to his heart and slightly bows his head, acknowledging an old friend, an old soldier. Quintus stares back and slowly backs away from Maximus.]
LUCILLA=>I don't know.
COMMODUS=>He shouldn't be alive. This vexes me. I am terribly vexed. [He sits back in his chair.] I did what I had to do. Had father had his way, the empire would have been torn apart. You do see that?
COMMODUS=>What did you feel when you saw him?
COMMODUS=>He wounded you deeply, didn't he?
LUCILLA=>No more than I wounded him.
COMMODUS=>They lied to me in Germania. They told me he was dead. If they lie to me they don't respect me. If they don't respect me then how can they ever love me?
LUCILLA=>Then you must let the legions know that treachery will not go unpunished.
COMMODUS=>Oh, Sister, I wouldn't want to be your enemy.
LUCILLA=>[pauses and then asks]
LUCILLA=>Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.
MAXIMUS=>[Viciously responds]
LUCILLA=>Maximus, he doesn't know.
MAXIMUS=>My family was burned and crucified while they were still alive.
LUCILLA=>I knew nothing....
MAXIMUS=>Don't lie to me!
LUCILLA=>I wept for them. [Maximus quickly reaches out and grabs her by the throat.]
MAXIMUS=>As you wept for your father? As you wept for your father?
LUCILLA=>I have been living in a prison of fear since that day. To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother. To live in terror every moment of every day, because your son is heir to the throne. Oh, I have wept.
MAXIMUS=>My son was innocent.
LUCILLA=>So is mine. Must my son die, too, before you can trust me? [Maximus releases his hold on her throat]
MAXIMUS=>What does it matter if I trust you or not?
LUCILLA=>The gods have spared you. Don't you understand? Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the Emperor of Rome.
MAXIMUS=>The gods have spared me? I am at their mercy with the power only to amuse a mob.
LUCILLA=>That is power. The mob is Rome. And while Commodus controls them he controls everything. Listen to me. My brother has enemies, most of all in the senate. But while the people follow him, no one would dare stand up to him until you.
MAXIMUS=>They oppose him, yet they do nothing.
LUCILLA=>There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome. One man above all. If I can arrange it, will you meet him?
MAXIMUS=>Do you not understand? I may die in this cell tonight or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave! What possible difference can I make?
LUCILLA=>This man wants what you want.
MAXIMUS=>[Roars back,]
MAXIMUS=>That man is gone. Your brother did his work well.
LUCILLA=>Let me help you.
MAXIMUS=>[lowers his voice in nearly a whisper and steps closer to Lucilla]
HAGEN=>Maximus, you commanded legions? Had many victories?
MAXIMUS=>Yes.
HAGEN=>In Germania?
MAXIMUS=>In many countries.
JUBA=>You have a great name. He must kill your name before he kills you.
FALCO=>Senator Gracchus. I don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.
GRACCHUS=>Well. I do not pretend to be a man of the people, Senator. But I do try to be a man for the people.
CASSIUS=>People of Rome. On the 4th day of Antioch, we can celebrate the 64th day of the games. And in his majestic charity, the Emperor has named this day to favour the people of Rome with an historical final match. Returning to the Colosseum today after five years in retirement, Caesar, is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history, the legendary...Tigris of Gaul!
PROXIMO=>He knows too well how to manipulate a mob.
MAXIMUS=>Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo. This is not it. This is not it!
PROXIMO=>Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus. We mortals are but shadows and dust, shadows and Dust, Maximus.
COMMODUS=>They embrace him like he's one of their own.
LUCILLA=>The mob is fickle brother. He'll be forgotten in a month.
COMMODUS=>No, much sooner than that. It has been arranged.
COMMODUS=>What am I going to do with you, you simply won't...die. Are we so different, you and I? You take life when you have to, as I do. [Exhausted from the fight, Maximus stares at him.]
MAXIMUS=>I only have one life left to take and then it is done.
COMMODUS=>Then take it now.
COMMODUS=>They tell me your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross.... And your wife, moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again, and again, and again.
MAXIMUS=>[ exhibiting extreme but calm restraint]
CROWD=>Maximus, Maximus, Maximus....
CICERO=>General! General!
MAXIMUS=>Where are you camped?
CICERO=>Ostia !
MAXIMUS=>Tell the men the general lives. Find me, find me! [As the guards pull Maximus away from Cicero, Cicero manages to give Maximus the pouch he was carrying. Maximus hides it inside his palms.]
JUBA=>Can they hear you?
MAXIMUS=>Who?
JUBA=>Your family, in the after life?
MAXIMUS=>Oh, yes.
JUBA=>What do you say to them ?
MAXIMUS=>To my boy, I tell him I will see him again soon, and to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse. [Maximus continues with a smile,] To my wife...that is not your business.
COMMODUS=>And now they love Maximus for his mercy, so I can't kill him or it makes him even more merciful. The whole thing is like a great...nightmare.
FALCO=>He is defying you. His every victory is an act of defiance, the mob sees this, and so do the Senate. Every day he lives they grow bolder. Kill him!
COMMODUS=>No! I will not make a martyr of him.
FALCO=>I have been told of a certain sea snake which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey. It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded, then its enemies will approach and yet it will lie quite still and then its enemies will take little bites of it and yet it remains still.
COMMODUS=>So, we will lie still and let our enemies come to us and nibble. ...have every senator followed.
MAXIMUS=>Cicero, my old friend! I thought I had seen you for the last time.
CICERO=>We thought you were dead!
MAXIMUS=>Close. How long have the men been in Ostia?
CICERO=>All winter.
MAXIMUS=>How do they look?
CICERO=>Fat and bored.
MAXIMUS=>Who is in command?
CICERO=>Some fool from Rome
MAXIMUS=>How soon do you think they could be ready to fight?
CICERO=>For you, tomorrow.
MAXIMUS=>I need you to do something for me.
CICERO=>M'lady! I served your father at Vindebona!
GUARD=>Back!
CICERO=>M'lady, I served your father at Vindebona.
GUARD=>Back!
CICERO=>And then served the General Maximus. I serve him still!
LUCILLA=>[to her escort]
LUCILLA=>[gives him two golden coins]
CICERO=>Thank you M'lady.
LUCILLA=>Leave us. Senator Gracchus.
MAXIMUS=>The Senate is with you?
GRACCHUS=>The senate? Yes I can speak for them.
MAXIMUS=>You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?
GRACCHUS=>To what end?
MAXIMUS=>Get me outside the city. Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is encamped there. By nightfall of the second day I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.
LUCILLA=>But the legion is under new commanders, Loyal to Commodus.
MAXIMUS=>When my men see me alive you shall see where their loyalties lies.
GRACCHUS=>This is madness. No army has entered Rome for 100 years. I will not trade one dictatorship for another.
MAXIMUS=>Time for half measures and talk is over. Senator. ...
GRACCHUS=>So, after your glorious coup, what then? You will take your 5,000 warriors and leave?
MAXIMUS=>I will leave. The soldiers will stay for your protection, under the command of the senate.
GRACCHUS=>So, once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people. Tell me why?
MAXIMUS=>[he turns to Lucilla]
GRACCHUS=>Marcus Aurelius trusted you. His daughter trusts you. I will trust you. But we have little time. Give me two days and I will buy your freedom. And you, you stay alive. Or I will be dead. Now I must go.
PROXIMO=>This won't work. The emperor knows too much. And as for me, it's becoming dangerous. [A soldier is seen outside, attempting to overhear their talk.]
MAXIMUS=>You will be paid on my return. I give you my word.
PROXIMO=>Your word! What if you don't return?
MAXIMUS=>Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?
PROXIMO=>Who am I to trust?
MAXIMUS=>I will kill Commodus.
PROXIMO=>Why do I want that. He makes me rich. I know, Maximus, that you are a man of your word, General. I know that you would die for honour. You would die for Rome. You would die for the memory of your ancestors. But I, on the other hand, am an entertainer. Guard!
MAXIMUS=>[as he leaves Proximo, he turns back to say...]
COMMODUS=>Where have you been? I sent for you.
LUCILLA=>Please, brother. What troubles you?
COMMODUS=>Does Gracchus have a new lover?
LUCILLA=>I don't know.
COMMODUS=>I thought you had seen him. He infects everyone like a putrid fever. For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled and he will be bled too, very soon.
LUCILLA=>But not tonight.
COMMODUS=>Do you remember what our father once said? It's a dream, a frightful dream...life is. Do you think that is true?
LUCILLA=>I don't know.
COMMODUS=>I think it is. And I have only you to share it with. [Lucilla comes closer, to comfort him. Commodus lays his head against her shoulder. He leans her back and lays her on the bed. With terror in her eyes, she lays still, fearful of what might happen. Commodus gently puts his finger to her mouth and tells her "open your mouth". Hesitantly she opens her mouth slightly as he places his finger to her lips and then to his. He presses his head to her shoulder and says "you know I love you." She replies, "and I love you." She lays still, her fear mounting at the thought of what may occur but Commodus soon lays his head down and falls asleep. Lucilla gently and quietly gets up and leaves.]
LUCILLA=>My brother has had Gracchus arrested. We dared not wait any longer. You must leave tonight. Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate. Your servant Cicero will be waiting with horses.
MAXIMUS=>You have done all this?
LUCILLA=>Yes.
MAXIMUS=>You risk too much.
LUCILLA=>I have much to pay for.
MAXIMUS=>You have nothing to pay for. You love your son. You are strong for him.
LUCILLA=>I am tired of being strong. My brother hates all the world. And you, most of all.
MAXIMUS=>Because your father chose me.
LUCILLA=>No, because my father loved you. And because I loved you.
MAXIMUS=>A long time ago. [Maximus tenderly takes her hand and kisses it.]
LUCILLA=>Was I very different then?
LUCILLA=>I have felt alone all my life, except with you. I must go.
MAXIMUS=>Yes. [They exchange a long tender kiss.]
COMMODUS=>Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?
LUCIUS=>I am not a legionnaire.
COMMODUS=>Not a legionnaire?
LUCIUS=>I am a gladiator.
COMMODUS=>A gladiator? Gladiators only fight in the games. Wouldn't you prefer to be a brave Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?
LUCIUS=>I am Maximus, the savior of Rome. [Commodus kneels in front of Lucius. His wooden sword slipping on the marble floor.]
COMMODUS=>The savior of Rome. And who said that? [Lucius whispers in his ear. Commodus holds him tighter and tighter as he hears.]
LUCIUS=>...she couldn't have.
COMMODUS=>Yes, she did. She took it from a basket, pressed it to her breast, right here above the heart. hissss
LUCIUS=>And it bit her in the breast?!
COMMODUS=>Yes. Sometimes royal ladies behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love.
LUCIUS=>I think it's silly.
COMMODUS=>So do I, so do I.
COMMODUS=>Sister...join us. I've been reading to dear Lucius.
LUCIUS=>I've been reading, too.
COMMODUS=>Yes, he's a very clever little boy. He'll make a grand Emperor one day.
COMMODUS=>We've been reading about the great Marc Anthony and his adventures in Egypt.
LUCIUS=>And the Queen killed herself with a snake!
COMMODUS=>[to Lucius]
COMMODUS=>But the Emperor knew they were up to something. He knew they were busy little bees. And one night he sat down with one of them and he looked at her and he said, "Tell me what you have been doing, busy little bee, or I shall strike down those dearest to you. You shall watch as I bathe in their blood." And the emperor was heartbroken. The little bee had wounded him more deeply than anyone had ever done. And what do you think happened then, Lucius?
LUCIUS=>I don't know Uncle.
COMMODUS=>[looking at Lucilla]
PROXIMO=>[walks to Maximus]
MAXIMUS=>Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man.
PROXIMO=>Hahh!
MAXIMUS=>Juba. [as Maximus hands him the ring of keys to the cells.]
MAXIMUS=>I only need moments so you need not be careless with your lives. If you don't want to be any part of this go back to your cells.
HAGEN=>We will wait here for you, Maximus. [The gladiators call out,] "Strength and Honour".
COMMODUS=>And what of my nephew and what of his mother? Shall they share her lover's fate or should I be merciful? Commodus the merciful. Lucius will stay with me now and if his mother so much as looks at me in a manner that displeases me, he will die. And if she decides to be noble and take her own life, he will die. And, as for you, [looking at Lucilla] you will love me as I have loved you. You will provide me with an heir of pure blood so that Commodus and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years. Am I not merciful? [He gets close to her face and tries to kiss her but Lucilla turns away. Commodus grabs her jaw, turning her face towards him screams]
AM I NOT MERCIFUL?!=>[Tears slowly come down Lucilla's face.]
COMMODUS=>[In a whisper]
MAXIMUS=>You would fight me?
COMMODUS=>Why not? Do you think I am afraid?
MAXIMUS=>I think you have been afraid all your life.
COMMODUS=>Unlike Maximus the invincible, who knows no fear?
MAXIMUS=>[ laughing]
COMMODUS=>I wonder. Did your friend smile at his own death?
MAXIMUS=>You must know. He was your father.
COMMODUS=>You loved my father, I know. But so did I. That makes us brothers, doesn't it? Smile for me now brother. [ Commodus embraces Maximus and with one cowardice, fierce thrust, stabs him with his dagger that has been hidden in his sleeve, and then kisses him on the neck.]
COMMODUS=>[to Quintus]
MAXIMUS=>Quintus, free my men. Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated. There was a dream that was Rome, it shall be realized. These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius. [Quintus calls out to the guards, "Free the prisoners, ...go!" ]
LUCILLA=>Is Rome worth one good man's life? We believed it once. Make us believe it again. He was a soldier of Rome. Honour him.
GRACCHUS=>Who will help me carry him?
JUBA=>Now we are free. I will see you again. But not yet, not yet.... - The End -
