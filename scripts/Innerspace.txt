AL=>...one small schlep for mankind...
AL=>...but it means money in the bank to me.
AL=>This is a small breakthrough. I've a right to make a statement.
COLIN=>What a pain in the...Where did we get this prima donna?... Then do try to keep it dignified. Puns are a sign of oxygen deprivation of the brain. Now give us bank three, if you would.
AL=>Alright, alright! Air filtration, 88; battery load, 76;...
JOE=>Remember me?
JOE=>Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
RECEPTIONIST.=>I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
RECEPTIONIST.=>...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
RECEPTIONIST.=>Is there anything else?
JOE=>A drink...
RECEPTIONIST.=>Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
JOE=>Thanks.
LEADER=>Hello.
GUARD=>Hello
LEADER=>We'd like to come in.
GUARD=>You'd like...to come in...
LEADER=>Open the door please.
GUARD=>Open the door?... Certainly.
LEADER=>Thank you.
GUARD=>My pleasure.
LEADER=>Hello.
TECH=>Hello.
LEADER=>We've come for the PEM114. Where is it?
LEADER=>Thank you.
LEADER=>Why?
LEADER=>Why not?
LEADER=>It's alright.
LEADER=>It will be fine. You have another.
LEADER=>Could I have it, please.
LEADER=>That's alright. Just tear it apart.
LEADER=>Yes.
LEADER=>What do you want?
LEADER=>Go get a drink.
LEADER=>Give it to me.
LEADER=>This the only spare?
LEADER=>The other working.
LEADER=>It'l be alright.
LEADER=>It doesn't hurt.
LEADER=>It tickles.
LEADER=>What's this? INT 5 They're further along than we thought.
W/T=>...response to door alarm...
LEADER=>Time to go... It doesn't matter. We have the PEM.
LEADER=>We must be off. Goodbye.
TECHS=>Goodbye...Goodbye...
LEADER=>I'm ...your mother.
LEADER=>Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
LEADER=>Give me the surveillance camera videotapes.
FINNEGAN=>...Well who did it look like?
FINNEGAN=>Who'd it look like to you?
FINNEGAN=>Mass hypnosis. Short term memory loss. Some kind of hallucinogenic gas...
MYER=>Kind of stuff the army's been working on.
COLIN=>Surveillance Cameras?
FINNEGAN=>They took the tapes.
COLIN=>You have nothing...
FINNEGAN=>We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
COLIN=>We'll have to let them go.
FINNEGAN=>Surveilliance on them all.
COLIN=>How did they know? No one knew.
AL=>Come in, control...Do you read me? Come in...damn!
AL=>Okay guys, what's going on? Who turned out the lights?
AL=>This wasn't in the plan.
AL=>Wait a minute...Got power...Going to external floods....Holy...Shit!!!
AL=>Where in the....YEAOOOW!!!
AL=>CHRIS, if this is one of your jokes....
FINNEGAN=>Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
JOE=>What?
FINNEGAN=>Your memory.
JOE=>What about it?
FINNEGAN=>It may have been affected.
JOE=>Oh.
FINNEGAN=>You may not remember things.
JOE=>What things?
FINNEGAN=>I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
JOE=>Oh...that's okay.
FINNEGAN=>When you do...
JOE=>Do what?
FINNEGAN=>When you remember...
JOE=>Remember what?
FINNEGAN=>Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
JOE=>Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
FINNEGAN=>Right.
JOE=>Who...are you?
FINNEGAN=>Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
JOE=>How do I look?
FINNEGAN=>Fine. You look fine.
JOE=>Thanks.
FINNEGAN=>Well...
JOE=>Well what?
FINNEGAN=>We're here.
JOE=>Here?
FINNEGAN=>Home. Your home. The address on your form.
JOE=>Oh.
FINNEGAN=>Don't you want to get out?
JOE=>Oh....Sure.
FINNEGAN=>Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
JOE=>I feel fine.
FINNEGAN=>You'll feel better
JOE=>I will?
FINNEGAN=>Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
FINNEGAN=>Joe.
JOE=>What?
FINNEGAN=>Take the card.
JOE=>Oh yeah, thanks...
AL=>What the hell is this?
AL=>Alright guys, the joke's gone far enough.
MOLLOY.=>Joe. How's it going? How'd it go with that job?
JOE=>What job?
REPORTER=>All we know, is that something has gone wrong here, but so far...no one is talking about it. Ron Golloway, with the ACTIONCAM...
AL=>Stomach acid! This stuff's caustic.
AL=>You guy's are...DRUNK! Okay, buster, I don't know who you are, but if I ever get out of you, you're in big trouble.
AL=>You'll wish you never thought of this.
JOE=>Well, think I'll go home.
MOLLOY=>Are you okay?
JOE=>Fine...fine. No problem. Just tired, that's all...
TV REPORTER=>...accident site at UNITED SYSTEMS LABS...
AL=>Oh, shit. A STRANGE LANDSCAPE - THE SAME AS SCENE ONE.
LEADER=>Run past this stuff.
INTRUDER=>You won't believe this.
LEADER=>What's the hell is this?
INTRUDER=>They've gone ahead. They did it.
BURR=>The craft, that man....
INTRUDER=>When we got there, it was gone...
LEADER=>What happened?
LEADER=>That Idiot!
BURR=>Who is that?
LEADER=>Nobody..just wanted a drink.
BURR=>Someone is the idiot...
BURR=>How long could his power last? TECH 2 In that envirnment, I don't think it matters.
BURR=>Dead or alive, there's a lot that machine could tell us.
AL=>Hello, Hello. Can you hear me?
AL=>Hello...Hello. Come in... Whoever you are...Hello!
A VOICE OVER=>Can you hear me?
JOE=>Of course, I can.
AL=>Yahooo! It works!!!...
AL=>You can hear me!
JOE=>You don't have to yell.
AL=>Then, answer me...
JOE=>I did. I said I can hear you just fine. What do you want?
WOMAN=>Who, me?
JOE=>Yes...What is it?
WOMAN=>What's what?
JOE=>What do you want?
WOMAN=>Nothing.
JOE=>What did you say?
WOMAN=>Nothing.
JOE=>What?
WOMAN=>I said...I didn't say..anything!
JOE=>Then who did?
WOMAN=>You did.
JOE=>No I didn't. You said something first.
AL=>I said something.
JOE=>I know you did!
AL=>No, not her. Me.
JOE=>Who's you?
AL=>My name is AL.
JOE=>Al ???!!!
JOE=>Where are you,...Al?
AL=>You're not gonna believe this...
JOE=>Try me.
AL=>I'm...inside you.
JOE=>Okay...which one of you guy's the ventriloquist???!!!
JOE=>You trying to kill us? Cut the shit and concentrate on your driving!
AL=>Calm down! Don't worry!
JOE=>Either drive or talk. Don't do both. Then I won't worry.
AL=>It's not him.
JOE=>Oh...and who is it!?
WOMAN=>I didn't say anything.
DRIVER=>Are you alright?
AL=>You'll find this hard to accept.
JOE=>Try me.
DRIVER=>Alright, get off the bus.
DRIVER=>You'll have to leave.
JOE=>What for?
DRIVER=>...creating a disturbance.
JOE=>Me?...! You created it. I'm the one that's being disturbed.
WOMAN=>You can say that again.
JOE=>Hey!!!
JOE=>I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
AL=>What's going on?
JOE=>...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
AL=>Don't do that.
JOE=>Why not.
JOE=>Arrrgh!
AL=>It wasn't him.
JOE=>Who was it?
AL=>Me.
JOE=>Who?
AL=>Al.
JOE=>Al.
AL=>Yes?
JOE=>This candid camera?
AL=>I'm in your head.
JOE=>You're in my head...
AL=>Yes.
JOE=>Your name is Al...
AL=>Yes.
JOE=>I see...
JOE=>No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play... What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
AL=>What is your name?
JOE=>You're in my head? You don't know my name?
AL=>I just got here.
JOE=>What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
AL=>Where are we?
JOE=>Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
AL=>What street?
JOE=>What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
AL=>Why don't we go home?
JOE=>Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
AL=>...I need to make a phone call.
JOE=>Do me a favor, Al.
AL=>Yeah?
JOE=>Shut up!
JOE=>Somebody's been here.
AL=>Where are we now?
JOE=>My place, can't you see?
AL=>No.
JOE=>You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
AL=>Right.
JOE=>Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
AL=>I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
JOE=>Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
AL=>What are you doing?
JOE=>Wait a minute, they didn't take anything...I'm not even worth robbing...This...they just messed it up ... Maybe I did it.
AL=>Who are you?
JOE=>Who am I?
AL=>Yeah...Who?
JOE=>Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
AL=>Quit screwing around, this is important.
JOE=>It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
AL=>I told you, my name is Al.
JOE=>What are you doing in my head, Al?
AL=>I'm a test pilot...
AL=>You've heard of the PEM114...
JOE=>That a new Datsun?
AL=>Don't screw with me, Buster. I don't know how you got into U.S.T. or where you got this crazy idea, but you get me back to the lab right now.
JOE=>Are you threatening me?
AL=>I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
AL=>Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
JOE=>Me? What'd I do?
AL=>Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
JOE=>I don't know what you're talking about.
AL=>The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
JOE=>No.
AL=>You've heard of U.S.T.?
JOE=>I just went there for a job.
AL=>Then how'd I get here?
JOE=>I don't know. Now Fuck Off!
AL=>I know...it sounds insane.
JOE=>You said it.
AL=>What are you doing?
JOE=>Loading a gun.
AL=>What for?
JOE=>Kill myself.
AL=>Are you crazy?
JOE=>Yep.
AL=>Don't do it. Don't aim at the head.
JOE=>Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
AL=>You're not crazy.
JOE=>Hear voices don't I.
AL=>Of course you do!
JOE=>Then I'm crazy.
AL=>You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
JOE=>You're gonna explain.
AL=>Yeah
JOE=>Why there's a little man in my head?
AL=>Yeah.
JOE=>Why he's argumentative?
AL=>Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
AL=>You'll be alive.
JOE=>With a man in my head...
AL=>Yeah.
AL=>Okay, Now, The Photon Echo Memory Chip...You've heard of that?
AL=>The Photon Echo Memory chip - the PEM114. It's the key. It's magical... It focuses massive computing power on one event: the creation of a mathematically induced real- life simulacrum encoded and synthesized on the molecular level with properties of the real model...and the transfer of a certain imponderable which might be called the life- force between the two in direct symbiosis. The effect is that man and machine are living on the molecular level...Now that's where we were when things went wrong. You understand... ... Are you listening?
AL=>I am real, Goddamn it. Hello?!!
AL=>What was that?
JOE=>Who was that? Somebody out there?
AL=>You weren't listening!
JOE=>Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head. Why don't I just take you back to UST?
AL=>Why don't you?
AL=>No they won't.
JOE=>Why not?
AL=>I'll talk to them.
JOE=>Oh...Gooood!
AL=>I'll tell you what to say.
JOE=>If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
AL=>If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
JOE=>Let's get out of here.
AL=>Anyone there?
JOE=>No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up. EXT. DESERTED ROAD - U.S.T LAB COMPLEX - in the distance.
AL=>Behind us?
JOE=>Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
AL=>What's that?
JOE=>Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
AL=>What'd he look like?
JOE=>He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
JOE=>I take that back.
AL=>What's happening?
JOE=>What do I do?
AL=>Outrun them.
JOE=>This is a Fiesta!
JOE=>Now what?
AL=>Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
AL=>Are we safe?
JOE=>I wouldn't say that.
AL=>Then what are you stopping for?
AL=>Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
JOE=>Can't see a Goddamn thi..
JOE=>Help!
JOE=>Ooofff!
SECURITY=>Stand where you are.
JOE=>I'm not going anywhere.
LEADER=>Let him go. We've got the PEM.
JOE=>I want out.
AL=>Too late...They want you.
JOE=>Why?
AL=>You know too much.
JOE=>I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
AL=>You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
AL=>Calm Down! Act rational.
JOE=>How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
FINNEGAN=>Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
JOE=>No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
FINNEGAN=>Why would we want to hurt you?
JOE=>Not you. Them.
FINNEGAN=>Who?
JOE=>I don't know Who.
JOE=>I don't know...To get Al.
AL=>No. Don't tell the guards.
FINNEGAN=>Al?
JOE=>The little man in my... ...head...
AL=>Oh shit.
AL=>He doesn't know about the experiment. He'll just think you're nuts.
AL=>The Emergency Committee!
AL=>Four! Why not wait till Spring! I have to talk to them.
JOE=>I have to talk to them.
COLIN=>What is it., Sergeant?
FINNEGAN=>Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
COLIN=>He work for us?
FINNEGAN=>Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
FINNEGAN=>What Job?
COLIN=>Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
FINNEGAN=>Sir?
COLIN=>Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
FINNEGAN=>Bit expensive, sir.
COLIN=>It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
AL=>Did you hear that?
JOE=>Yeah. Al wants to talk to you!
COLIN=>...You know the implications for the lab.
COLIN=>They're not gonna tell.
AL=>Hey, wait a minute. They don't have a clue who led the attack. Or who has the PEM. I don't like the sound of this.
JOE=>I get the idea they're writing you off.
AL=>What is it? What happened?
AL=>I'll be out of touch for a bit.
JOE=>Going somewhere?
AL=>I'll be right back. Don't go away.
COLIN=>...If he was right here, what would we do? What would we tell him?
COLIN=>Look at this mess. That would take months.
AL=>It can't take that long.
JOE=>Why?
TECH3=>We have to get the PEM and reverse the process...before...
JOE AL=>...the POD looses power and can no longer maintain life support.
COLIN=>How soon? TECH 2 WITHIN 92 HOURS...
JOE JOE=>Or what?
AL=>I don't know. I don't want to find out.
AL=>They'll find a way.
JOE=>They could put you back in the tube..
AL=>I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
JOE=>Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
AL=>They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
JOE=>Yeah...Who is?
AL=>I am. You are.
JOE=>You are CRAZY!
AL=>You're the one talking to a little guy in your head. ...We'll have to do it on our own.
JOE=>What do you mean we.
AL=>You gotta help.
JOE=>I did. I brought you back here.
AL=>We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
JOE=>Thanks.
AL=>Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
JOE=>I'm not leaving until you do.
FINNEGAN=>Nobody asked you to.
AL=>You tell them about me, they'll put us both away for sure. Get out...now.
JOE=>I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
FINNEGAN=>Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
AL=>Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
JOE=>Find You?
AL=>I'm not gonna make it easy.
AL=>They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
JOE=>Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
AL=>I got nowhere to go. Neither do you. You're either crazy, or... you got a little man in your head. Either way, they're gonna hold on to you.
AL=>Do these guys look like they've got your best interests at heart.
AL=>Now's your chance. You want out, just tell him.
JOE=>Ahhh...nothing.
FINNEGAN=>Been complaning of hallucinations.
JOE=>Not...complaining, actually.
FINNEGAN=>Been hearing voices.
JOE=>Oh...quiet ones...you would'nt be interested, actually.
FINNEGAN=>Was quite excited, when he came in...
JOE=>Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
JOE=>I'll be fine...fine..
FINNEGAN=>What about all that stuff about a man in your head?
AL=>Sue them.
JOE=>I'll sue.
FINNEGAN=>Sue who?
JOE=>You...him...UST.
JOE=>Great!?
JOE=>I don't like the sound of that.
AL=>We have to get out of here.
JOE=>Door's locked.
AL=>See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
JOE=>Now what.
AL=>Go out, take your first left.
JOE=>Just walk down the hall?
AL=>With Authority!
JOE=>Which way do I go?
AL=>What does it say.
JOE=>Corridor A.
AL=>Take a left and your next right.
JOE=>Where are we going?
AL=>What do you see?
JOE=>A lab and equipment.
AL=>Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
JOE=>I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
AL=>Who did?
JOE=>The man.
JOE=>Oh my God.
AL=>Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
JOE=>I can't remember..
AL=>Concentrate. What did he look like?
JOE=>Like the guys that attacked us.
AL=>What do you mean?
JOE=>Black suits and helmets.
AL=>That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
JOE=>That's not a good idea.
AL=>They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
JOE=>Gone where?
AL=>Don't know.
JOE=>You need ID in there?
AL=>You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
JOE=>I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
AL=>You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
JOE=>Hopeless. Nothing here.
AL=>Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
JOE=>Nothing!
AL=>Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
JOE=>Just scratched my arm, why?
AL=>I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
JOE=>The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
AL=>Under the threshold, I'm too small to do damage.to the body ...or they'll get to me later.
AL=>I'm back.
JOE=>I'm at the airport.
AL=>Good. Get to a phone.
AL=>Call this number in Washington.
JOE=>Who is it?
AL=>Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
JOE=>Al..
AL=>Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
JOE=>What am I supposed to do?
AL=>Nothing. You just do nothing.
JOE=>Sorry. She's out of her mind!
JOE=>Yes dear..yes dear...
JOE=>What is it?
AL=>Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
AL=>GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE=>What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
AL=>It's all we've got.
JOE=>What do we do?
AL=>Send a man there. A secret agent.
JOE=>Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
AL=>You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
JOE=>What abilities...?
AL=>Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
JOE=>You mean...just leave.
AL=>We get on a plane.
JOE=>We get on which plane? INSIDE INT. THE POD
AL=>The one for...JAPAN
JOE=>What about money?
AL=>What about it?
JOE=>I don't have any.
AL=>Use my credit cards.
JOE=>I can't do that.
AL=>Why not?
JOE=>It's illegal.
AL=>Who cares?
JOE=>I'll get in trouble.
AL=>You are in trouble. Now do it.
AL=>Thus Joe Doakes, chronic under- achiever, becomes Secret Agent 001.. with a desperate assignment...
JOE=>...and a license to kill...
AL=>Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
JOE=>Hey...You forgot something.
JOE=>They'll know who I am.
AL=>We'll change your appearance.
JOE=>It's just not enough.
AL=>It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
JOE=>What's wrong with how I carry myself.
AL=>Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
JOE=>Oh yeah, to what?
AL=>You'll be me.
JOE=>I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
AL=>Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
JOE=>You leave my glands alone!
STEWARDESS=>Are you alright in there?
JOE=>Fine...fine.
JOE=>Now what?
AL=>The beach.
JOE=>The beach?
AL=>How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
JOE=>Eating sushi?
AL=>Just get there.
JOE=>Holy shit!
AL=>What is it?
JOE=>...Just beautiful.
AL=>Do you notice anything.
JOE=>The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
AL=>Swim.
JOE=>Good Idea!
AL=>Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
JOE=>Little late for that.
JOE=>Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
AL=>You eat it.
JOE=>You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
AL=>I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
JOE=>Now what?
AL=>The sand.
JOE=>Eat it?
AL=>Eat it.
JOE=>I don't want to eat it.
AL=>Why not?
JOE=>It's sand.
AL=>For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
AL=>Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
JOE=>Where are you going? Wait!
AL=>It matches.
JOE=>Good. Now what?
JOE=>Al, are you doing anything in there?
AL=>What? What do you mean?
JOE=>Are you screwing with any nerves?
JOE=>My god...She's real!
JOE=>Beautiful!
AL=>What was?
JOE=>A girl.
JOE=>This must be business, there's nothing else here.
AL=>Follow it.
JOE=>Good idea!
AL=>What is it?
JOE=>She's...pretty fast.
AL=>You're out of shape.
AL=>What is it?
JOE=>She's beautiful...! What do I do?
AL=>Tell her.
JOE=>You're beautiful..
AL=>What's happening?
JOE=>She doesn't seem to understand.
AL=>Try another language.
JOE=>Which language?
AL=>How should I know?
JOE=>Vous etes tres beau.
JOE=>Now what?
JOE=>Help me out, will you?
AL=>What can I do? You're on your own.
RENE=>How can I help you?
JOE=>Wait. Don't go...There's..more!
JOE=>What do I do?
AL=>Don't just stand there, say something.
JOE=>What?
AL=>Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
RENE=>What do you do about what?
JOE=>...I'm looking for someone.
AL=>Not that truth!
RENE=>Aren't we all.
JOE=>Come on...it's going to take two of us to make this work.
JOE=>...at least two.
RENE=>Is someone else here?
JOE=>No. No one to speak of.
RENE=>I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
AL=>How about a quotation...? A poet...Blake!
JOE=>...Blake
RENE=>Blake?
JOE=>The poet...something he said...
RENE=>Yes?
RENE=>Blake said that?
JOE=>Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
AL=>Sorry...
RENE=>It'll remind me of you.
AL=>Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
JOE=>You won't need to be reminded.
RENE=>Why not?
JOE=>I'll be right there.
RENE=>Where?
JOE=>Dinner...tonight.
RENE=>Oh...I can't. Business.
AL=>Wait.
JOE=>Wait.
AL=>Where is she staying?
JOE=>Where are you staying?
RENE=>Right here.
RENE=>And you.
JOE=>...right here too.
RENE=>Haven't seen you around.
JOE=>I just got here. She's getting away.
AL=>Touch her.
JOE=>What?
AL=>Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
AL=>Doesn't matter.
RENE=>What part what?
AL=>The best part. She'll love it.
JOE=>I can't do that?
RENE=>Do what?
JOE=>Let you leave without it.
RENE=>Without what?
RENE=>I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
AL=>Do what? What'd you do?
JOE=>I saw it in a movie.
AL=>Saw what?!
RENE=>What is your name?
AL=>Don't give her your name.
JOE=>...Joe.
AL=>No...you idiot!
JOE=>Or better yet,...Al.
JOE=>What's so funny?
RENE=>Nothing...Al. Why do you talk that way?
JOE=>What way?
RENE=>Like there's someone else here.
JOE=>It's...all the sun...No... its the beach...The light.... and the water...
JOE=>Naw...It's just you.
JOE=>Wait. What's your name?
RENE=>...Rene.
AL=>What happened?
JOE=>...Rene...
AL=>Where are you going?
JOE=>To the hotel. To register.
AL=>Without your pants.
JOE=>Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
AL=>Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
JOE=>Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
AL=>It worked.
JOE=>I made it work.
AL=>You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
JOE=>Rene...
JOE=>I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
AL=>Well you did it today.
JOE=>Yeah. I did it.
AL=>But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
JOE=>Now, fuck off.
AL=>Mayday! Goddamn it. Stop!
AL=>What is this? What is this? Joe! Joe, are you there?
JOE=>Now, where would I be?
AL=>What are you looking at?
JOE=>Nothing.
AL=>But what's it look like?
JOE=>What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
AL=>Is something glinting?
JOE=>Sure something's glinting.
JOE=>What is it, it's nothing... It's just the sun.
JOE=>What is it?
AL=>Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
AL=>You really like that shirt?
JOE=>This...is not going to work out.
SALESMAN=>Sir?
JOE=>Ahh...ahh...ahh...The shirt!...
SALESMAN=>The shirt?
AL=>Much too blue.
JOE=>Not blue enough.
SALESMAN=>Not blue enough, sir. Right it is.
JOE=>Mind your own business.
AL=>It is my business. It's my name.
JOE=>But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
SALESMAN=>How about these, sir?
JOE=>...just like I want..
AL=>Not that tie with that coat.
JOE=>Why not?!
SALESMAN=>Why not, indeed, Sir!
AL=>It's much too loud.
JOE=>So are you.
JOE=>And all these, too.
JOE=>Send it to my room.
AL=>What did that cost?
JOE=>You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
AL=>Doesn't.
AL=>Which one is she?
JOE=>The beautiful one.
AL=>They both look good to me.
JOE=>You have no taste.
MAITRE'D=>Sir?
JOE=>I'd like a place. For one.
MAITRE'D=>Yes Sir. Right this way.
AL=>Get close to them.
JOE=>That place. By the window.
MAITRE'D=>I'm sorry, Sir. That's for four persons.
JOE=>I'll be four persons.
MAITRE'D=>Excuse me, Sir?
JOE=>If they don't show up, charge me for four. Send the bill to my room.
MAITRE'D=>Yes Sir! Four it is!
JOE=>How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
WAITER=>Sir?
JOE=>How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
WAITER=>We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
JOE=>This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
AL=>Don't overplay it.
JOE=>If it's sophistication you want, I'm the man for it.
AL=>That's Rene?
JOE=>Now you know what I know.
WAITER=>Sir?
JOE=>About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
WAITER=>Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
AL=>You're not just after this girl, are you?
JOE=>Who, me?
JOE=>You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
AL=>Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
JOE=>That's a big if.
AL=>Wait. I think I know that guy.
AL=>Shit. Pay attention!
AL=>Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
JOE=>What glasses.
AL=>The drinks...Stay on them.
AL=>Follow that busboy.
JOE=>Are you serious?
WAITER=>About what sir?
JOE=>The fresh tuna?..
WAITER=>Yessir...very good sir.
JOE=>I'll have it.
JOE=>I feel like an idiot.
AL=>Just hold them close and stay still.
AL=>Well, we know one of them's a danger.
JOE=>Will you hurry up, I'm hungry.
AL=>One of these guys is on file.
JOE=>Which one?
AL=>The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
JOE=>Killer!
JOE=>That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
GRUNER=>I noticed you staring.
JOE=>Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
GRUNER=>Enjoy your lunch.
AL=>Just don't show fear.
JOE=>I don't know what's going on.
AL=>It lends you an air of mystery.
RENE=>Thought we lost you.
DIETER=>Who is your friend?
RENE=>We met on the beach.
DIETER=>Join us.
JOE=>I don't want to intrude.
DIETER=>We insist.
JOE=>Al Viola.
DIETER=>That name's familiar.
JOE=>It is to me too.
DIETER=>You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
AL=>He recognises you, throw him off.
JOE=>My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
AL=>Don't get too cute.
DIETER=>And what do you do?
AL=>Let's make 'em nervous. Tell them you're CIA, see what they do.
JOE=>...Foreign service.
DIETER=>And how do you service foreigners.
JOE=>Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
RYUJI=>Must be a fulfilling occupation.
JOE=>It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
DIETER=>What brings you here?
JOE=>I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
RENE=>You mean from it.
JOE=>Yes, of course.
AL=>Could be him. Look at that watch.
JOE=>Look at that watch...
RYUJI=>CMOS chips. The latest thing. Ryuji Obe. Pleasure to meet you.
AL=>High Tech Japanese. Highly Suspect.
DIETER=>And...you know Jan Gruner?
JOE=>I think I've heard of you.
RENE=>His country has no laws against dealing in strategic technology.
GRUNER=>I provide service to my customers.
AL=>At least he's telling the truth.
JOE=>And you?
RENE=>I just work for the travel firm.
AL=>She's hard to read, but she's hiding something too.
GRUNER=>And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
JOE=>A little voice in my head.
AL=>Joe, be careful!
JOE=>...I've lost something. I must get it back.
RYUJI=>What could you find in this place?
JOE=>...Piece of mind.
GRUNER=>You may you find all the solitude you want.
JOE=>Thanks, I appreciate that.
RYUJI=>We have some work.. Please excuse us.
AL=>They're all in it.
JOE=>How do you know?
AL=>Voice stress analyzer.
JOE=>Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
JOE=>Even Rene?
AL=>She's the toughest to read.
JOE=>Maybe she's telling the truth.
AL=>Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
JOE=>Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
AL=>I know what your instinct is.
RENE=>You again.
JOE=>Me still. They left you alone?
RENE=>I waited for you.
JOE=>Why?
RENE=>...I...don't know.
AL=>You believe that, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn for you.
RENE=>I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
JOE=>It's not apparent.
RENE=>...and sort of...disinterest.
JOE=>Disinterest?
RENE=>As if your mind's not all there.
JOE=>I am sort of scattered.
RENE=>Can I help?
JOE=>You are.
RENE=>Are you alright?
AL=>Yeah, are you? You're talking nonsense.
AL=>What is it, your charm?
JOE=>This just won't work.
AL=>You're doing great with her.
JOE=>Not her. You!
AL=>What is it?
JOE=>You can't listen. You can't watch either.
JOE=>It's embarrassing.
AL=>What if she says something important?
JOE=>I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
AL=>What am I supposed to do?
JOE=>You got any books in there?
AL=>Oh come on.
JOE=>You shut down your sensors.
AL=>Joe! It's 56 hours!
JOE=>I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
AL=>...Okay...okay. Just...don't take all night!
RENE=>Promise me something.
JOE=>Okay, no more poems.
JOE=>Promise you what?
RENE=>That you're not crazy.
JOE=>I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
RENE=>You talk to yourself.
JOE=>But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
RENE=>Why do you do it?
JOE=>If I was with you, I wouldn't
RENE=>You did.
JOE=>That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
RENE=>You're talking to me.
JOE=>And how'm I doing?
RENE=>You're doing...Okay.
JOE=>Just Okay...
RENE=>...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
JOE=>...Naw. Made that up.
RENE=>Who do you work for?
JOE=>No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
RENE=>Trans Ocean Travel.
JOE=>Is that Ryuji?
RENE=>No. Ryuji just hires us.
JOE=>Hires you for what?
RENE=>To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
JOE=>How often they come here?
RENE=>He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
JOE=>And you, what do you like?
RENE=>That depends...
AL=>Wake up. Time to wake up. Sixty four hours...Shit!
AL=>What Happened?
JOE=>I don't know!
AL=>What she say. What'd you get out of her?
JOE=>Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
AL=>Is that all?
JOE=>Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
AL=>Anything else!
JOE=>She's got the most beautiful...s
AL=>Shit! You're in love.
AL=>And on my time.
JOE=>It's not your time. I get time off.
AL=>You get time off to sleep.
JOE=>That's what I was doing..mostly.
AL=>I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
JOE=>It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
AL=>Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
JOE=>No. What do you hope?
AL=>I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
JOE=>No. What will you do.
AL=>I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
CLERK=>Sorry sir, they checked out.
JOE=>Forwarding address?
CLERK=>Sorry, sir. Nothing.
AL=>You been had. We have.
JOE=>It wasn't like that.
AL=>Some agent you are.
JOE=>Why don't you get out of my face.
AL=>Bingo.
JOE=>You found her.
AL=>Better. I found Ryuji.
JOE=>That's good. It's not better. Where?
AL=>Osaka.
JOE=>Osaka?
AL=>Fountainhead of High-Tech.
JOE=>Don't you think I stand out like this.
AL=>We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
JOE=>I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
JOE=>What do I do?
AL=>Follow her.
JOE=>On what?
AL=>Run, stupid!
AL=>Come on, she's getting away.
JOE=>I can't keep up.
JOE=>I gotta sit down.
AL=>I'm putting you on a training regimen...right now.
JOE=>Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
AL=>That's not funny.
JOE=>Sapporo..
AL=>Just stay here and rest.
JOE=>Where are you going?
AL=>Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
JOE=>Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
AL=>While I'm away, just do something safe and calm....
JOE=>Al...can you hear me, Suspicious characters. Al!!! Shit!
JOE=>Al. Help!
AL=>Joe, what is it? Hang on.
AL=>Slow your pulse.
AL=>` I gotta get to a vein taking blood to the brain or I won't be able to help.
AL=>`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
JOE=>What do I do?
AL=>Relax. Let me do this.
AL=>Relax. Make your mind a blank.
JOE=>It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
AL=>What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
JOE=>You think. That's what you're good at.
RENE=>Joe! What happened to you?
JOE=>Why'd you run off?
RENE=>I didn't run off.
RYUJI=>Joe! Hey...I like your outfit..
RYUJI=>What are you doing here? You shouldn't wander around alone...
RYUJI=>Oh, I see. Hey...were going to my place for a late dinner, why don't you join us?
JOE=>Why did you leave?
RENE=>They left. I had to go with them.
JOE=>Why didn't you tell me?
JOE=>Why did you stay with me?
RENE=>Wanted to get to know you.
JOE=>Why?
RENE=>You seemed interesting.
JOE=>Who else is interested in me?
RENE=>What do you mean?
JOE=>Your friends, did they ask about me?
RENE=>They kidded me a little.
JOE=>What did you tell them?
RENE=>There's not much to tell.
JOE=>Why did they leave?
RENE=>I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
JOE=>You work for Ryuji?
RENE=>Sometimes. I told you I did.
JOE=>Were you working for him last night?
RENE=>Last night?
JOE=>Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
RENE=>No, he didn't do that.
JOE=>He didn't.
RENE=>No.
JOE=>Who did?
RENE=>You did.
AL=>I've run checks, there's nothing on her. That along is suspicous.
AL=>Yeah...You've fallen for her.
JOE=>I told you, I have a feeling...
AL=>One of your instincts?
JOE=>I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
JOE=>Bye Mom..
AL=>I think I've got it.
AL=>Joe, pay attention!
JOE=>Now, what?
AL=>Don't touch a thing.
JOE=>Don't worry!
RENE=>I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
JOE=>This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
JOE=>What is it?
RENE=>Hakasuti!
AL=>The batteries are dropping. Got to recharge them somehow.
RYUJI=>In honor of our...unexpected guest.
AL=>No..Don't...
AL=>...drink it.
JOE=>Too late.
RYUJI=>Excuse me?
JOE=>Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
AL=>You just got a Mickey.
RYUJI=>Bandaio. Grown near here.
JOE=>What next!
AL=>Drink lots of water.
RYUJI=>What next, Indeed.
AL=>Now get out of here.
JOE=>I can't...
AL=>You have to! Quickly!
JOE=>...imagine a better grape for the region.
JOE=>Oh, no! I'll go wipe this off. Excuse me.
JOE=>What are you doing?
AL=>Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
JOE=>Now what? Oh,No?
AL=>And after that,lie down for a while.
AL=>If they wanted us out, they must be up to something.
AL=>...To the left. To the left.
AL=>They passed this way, the trail is warmer...Quietly now.
AL=>Now, be careful.
AL=>To the left, to the left.
JOE=>Ow!
AL=>A hard left. A hard left.
AL=>Door to the right. Get up and run.
JOE=>I can't see a thing.
AL=>Neither can they.
AL=>Shit ! Look out!
JOE=>What are you doing?
THUG=>I'm beating the shit out of you.
AL=>Blocking pain impulses with Endo-Morphins. You'll be alright.
JOE=>I won't look so good.
RIUJI=>No. Never mind him, Where is GRUNER?
RYUJI=>Keep looking.
RIUJI=>Now, who do you work for?
JOE=>What can I say?
AL=>I'm working on it.
AL=>Here it is.. .
RYUJI=>Who are you? What do you want?
JOE=>What?
AL=>Never mind, just say it.
RYUJI=>How do you know that? CIA?
AL=>I think he deals in...
JOE=>...you deal in stolen technology. ...from...Glomsui.
RYUJI=>I am GLOMSUI! Corporate Security.
AL=>He was with Gruner!
JOE=>You were with GRUNER!
RIUJI=>And now he's gone! What do you think you're doing, stumbling through this case. I almost had the goods in my hand!
JOE=>You know what he's got?
RIUJI=>Whatever it is, he's still got it.
JOE=>You going after him?
RYUJI=>I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
JOE=>Why are you on to him?
RYUJI=>We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
JOE=>Why'd you invite me here?
RYUJI=>Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
JOE=>What about the others.
RYUJI=>I don't know.
JOE=>Would you have bought it from him?
RENE=>You're leaving.
JOE=>Food doesn't agree with me.
RENE=>I'm leaving too.
JOE=>Why?
RENE=>This business is over.
JOE=>I'm sorry. What will you do?
RENE=>Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
JOE=>I'm just on vacation.
RENE=>Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
AL=>No!
RENE=>Oh, I can't.
AL=>Good.
JOE=>I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
AL=>No. You can't trust her.
JOE=>You know where he went?
RENE=>What's he done?
JOE=>He stole something. From a friend of mine.
RENE=>He must be a good friend.
JOE=>We're very close.
RENE=>What'd he steal?
JOE=>A chip. Goes in a computer.
RENE=>One chip?
JOE=>The most important one. Can you help me find him?
RENE=>How do you know you can trust me?
JOE=>Got to trust someone.
AL=>Who says so?
RENE=>I don't know. He mentioned a city.
JOE=>What is it?
RENE=>Hiroshima.
JOE=>Get your things.
AL=>Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
JOE=>Probably.
AL=>I don't trust her.
JOE=>Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
JOE=>You don't believe me.
RENE=>Oh sure.
JOE=>Then why are you smiling like that?
RENE=>Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
JOE=>You think I'm like that?
JOE=>What's Gruner like?
RENE=>They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
JOE=>Who was?
RENE=>Ryuji and Gruner.
JOE=>And Dieter.
RENE=>Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
JOE=>And you?
RENE=>It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
RENE=>I can't even see in this light. How do you know it's him?
AL=>It's him.
JOE=>Come on.
RENE=>Where we going?
JOE=>Beats me.
RENE=>This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
JOE=>Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
RENE=>Then where's the chip.
AL=>If you were going to smuggle a chip, where would you put it.
AL=>Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
AL=>I've got an idea.
JOE=>I was afraid of that.
RENE=>What?
JOE=>He plays it all the time.
JOE=>You sure this will work?
AL=>Not sure at all.
JOE=>Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
AL=>Just say the words. Just like I told you.
JOE=>What was it? What'd I say?
AL=>You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
AL=>haka xuki.
JOE=>haka xuki. What's that mean?
AL=>Cash.
WAITER=>...It's Thrirrer, Micaer Jaksin.
RENE=>Now what?
JOE=>We figure out if it's in here.
RENE=>How?
JOE=>Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
JOE=>How?
AL=>Left...The one with the red dot.
JOE=>Well...?
AL=>It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
AL=>So Long, Suckers!
JOE=>We been had.
RENE=>That must be him. Water taxi.
JOE=>Get us one.
RENE=>Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
JOE=>He hung us up dry.
AL=>While he makes the run.
JOE=>Where?
RENE=>Where what?
JOE=>Where would you go to sell a chip?
AL=>We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
RENE=>Dieter?
JOE=>If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
RENE=>Hong Kong.
JOE=>What?
RENE=>Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
JOE=>Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
RENE=>I asked him.
JOE=>Oh.
AL=>See...I don't trust her.
JOE=>Why'd you ask him.
RENE=>He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
JOE=>Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
DIETER=>What are you doing here, where've you been?
RENE=>I have a new client.
DIETER=>That crazy guy?
RENE=>Yes. Joe.
AL=>She thinks a lot of you.
DIETER=>Where is he now?
RENE=>Oh...I came on ahead.
DIETER=>Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
RENE=>It's just money.
DIETER=>Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
DIETER=>You know Rene.
GRUNER=>There was a mixup. I got your wristwatch.
DIETER=>I knew it wasn't mine. Must have switched them swimming.
AL=>It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
JOE=>And Dieter?
AL=>He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
JOE=>Then, why'd he lead us here.
AL=>He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
AL=>...Until now.
AL=>Do it.
JOE=>I can't handle that thing.
AL=>Don't worry, I can.
AL=>Don't fight me. Just relax...
JOE=>RELAX?!!!
RENE=>What?
JOE=>I said just relax. I'm in full control.
RENE=>Done much high-speed driving?
RENE=>Oh...nothing....Why do you scream on the turns?
JOE=>Oxygen. Good for the brain.
RENE=>I'll walk from here.
AL=>Are you alright?
JOE=>Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
RENE=>Not with me, you won't. He does'nt seem to like you either.
RENE=>Who, me?
GRUNER=>Do nothing. Just give me the keys.
AL=>Aim just in front of his face.
JOE=>Aim what?
GRUNER=>At this distance, there's no aim involved
AL=>Get ready!
JOE=>Don't do it!
GRUNER=>Just give me the keys.
JOE=>Whatever it is, don't do it.
RENE=>He's out. Come on...We don't want to be found here.
AL=>What about the chip? Open the package..
JOE=>Holy...
AL=>...Shit! It's just money.
AL=>Nothing. It isn't here!
JOE=>He aready made the deal..
AL=>The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
JOE=>Dieter!
AL=>GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
RENE=>Chiang Cho?
JOE=>...across THE BORDER. Come on!
RENE=>That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
JOE=>You've been there?
RENE=>I know the territory.
JOE=>You coming along?
AL=>I'm against it.
RENE=>I insist.
JOE=>So do I.
RENE=>This going to work?
JOE=>Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
RENE=>He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
AL=>Quit showing off.
JOE=>There's a lot you don't know.
AL=>And don't let her know, either.
AL=>This may hurt.
JOE=>Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
AL=>Retention of fluids...The rest is...
GUARD=>We know who you are, GRUNER.
JOE=>I've got a permit for the cash.
GUARD=>We'll just make sure.
BURR=>You didn't tell us you were coming?
JOE=>Then how did you know?
JOE=>Is something wrong?
BURR=>You've cut your hair?
JOE=>I dyed it. We're all getting old.
BURR=>Why are you here?
JOE=>PEM115!
BURR=>**?!!
JOE=>Newer, more powerful design.
JOE=>What's happening?
AL=>We're onto something. **?!! is Cantonese for Lab.
JOE=>About time.
JOE=>Pretty advanced, isn't it?
AL=>Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
DIETER=>
AL=>He's up to something. I have the real chip.
JOE=>Do something.
AL=>What exactly?
JOE=>I don't know.
RENE=>Can you fly this?
AL=>Don't worry.
JOE=>Why not?
RENE=>Can you?
JOE=>Sure I can, can't I?
AL=>Sure.
AL=>Hang on!..
JOE=>What happened?
AL=>Losing power. The laser drained it.
RENE=>What happened?
JOE=>I can't fly it.
RENE=>What'd...you forget?
RENE=>What is wrong with you?
JOE=>I'll tell you nothing.
GUARD=>Who asked?
JOE=>Don't you want to torture me?.
GUARD=>Later.
AL=>Be quiet.
JOE=>Where've you been?
AL=>Never mind that, where are we now.
JOE=>We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
AL=>Gimme a minute.
JOE=>Looks like you can have all you want.
JOE=>I can always flush you down the toilet.
AL=>Keep thinking.
JOE=>I have been... I think you're right.
AL=>About what?
JOE=>Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
AL=>Rene?
JOE=>She works for them.
AL=>Now, you're too suspicious.
JOE=>You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
AL=>I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
JOE=>No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
RENE=>You let me out of here!! You son of a...
RENE=>Well, thanks. Nice to be here too!
JOE=>Are you alright?
RENE=>Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
JOE=>Looks like they can. What did they do?
RENE=>They asked about you.
JOE=>What did you tell them?
RENE=>That I really don't know.
JOE=>Now what?
RENE=>They'll listen to what we say in here.
AL=>She is beautiful.
JOE=>You've changed your mind.
RENE=>What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
JOE=>Why?
AL=>Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
AL=>Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
JOE=>Oh no!
RENE=>What?
JOE=>What a mess.
RENE=>You can say that again. What do we do?
JOE=>Nothing we can do.
AL=>I know it's no good. I've no right to be jealous.
AL=>She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
JOE=>They can?
RENE=>What?
JOE=>They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
RENE=>Can't you do something?
AL=>It's a real mess. I'm sorry I got you into this.
JOE=>I'm sorry I got you into this.
RENE=>It was my choice.
AL=>You're a lucky man.
JOE=>Yeah, sure.
RENE=>Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
JOE=>Why did you, then?
RENE=>For you.
AL=>She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
JOE=>You're lovely.
RENE=>I'm...scared.
AL=>Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
JOE=>I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
AL=>I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
JOE=>I want to thank you for what you've done.
RENE=>I didn't do anything.
AL=>I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
JOE=>Awwww...
AL=>I mean it! No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
RENE=>I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
JOE=>I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
JOE=>I've learned a lot. I don't regret a thing. If it ends here, with you that's okay with me.
AL=>Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
JOE=>I'll get us out of here.
AL=>Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
RENE=>How?
JOE=>What?
AL=>Take her hand.
JOE=>Now what?
RENE=>I've never met anyone like you.
AL=>Kiss her.
AL=>In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE=>That's nice.
RENE=>Nice?
AL=>In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
JOE=>Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
RENE=>I love you too.
JOE=>Could we be alone?
RENE=>If this isn't alone, I don't know what is.
JOE=>Don't worry.
RENE=>Why not, what are you going to do?
JOE=>Escape.
RENE=>Just like that?
JOE=>I'll come back for you.
RENE=>Aren't you a little optimistic?
JOE=>What happened?..must have slipped...
JOE=>What happened?..Al, what the hell are you doing?
DIETER=>What do you think, Rene?
DIETER=>What?
JOE=>Come on, Al! Quit fooling around I know you're in there... I haven't so much as spit...
JOE=>You son of a bitch! You conned me!
RENE=>You're gonna laugh.
DIETER=>Yes?
RENE=>He's not an ordinary man.
DIETER=>Enough ROmance.
RENE=>He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
DIETER=>He's what?
RENE=>He's...sigmmoflbbbwwggpp....
DIETER=>He must have drugged her.
DIETER=>I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
BURR=>Rene?
DIETER=>She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
DIETER=>He still has the POD.
BURR=>Impossible.
DIETER=>I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
DIETER=>If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
BURR=>Who's our little man?
DIETER=>Me.
BURR=>No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
DIETER=>I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
JOE=>Well, don't just stand around, let me up.
BURR=>Dieter?
JOE/DIETER=>Who do you think? Now let me up, and I'll show you what this thing can do.
BURR=>Go ahead. What can it do?
JOE=>Escape!
DIETER=>Hey, what's going on? Answer me...Rupert.
RENE=>What happened?
BURR=>Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
RENE=>In him?
BURR=>It's a long story.
RENE=>ya hyutn slulptsa?
BURR=>What?
RENE=>I said...He'll head for the border.
RENE=>I know you're in there. I'll make you a deal.
AL=>What kind of a deal?
RENE=>Let us get to the border!
AL=>Then what?
AL=>I knew you were trouble.
RENE=>Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
AL=>Deal.
JOE=>Rene!
JOE=>You work for them?
RENE=>Kiss her you fool.
JOE=>Her?
JOE=>I don't care if you do work for them. I doesn't bother me.
JOE=>Who are you? Who do you work for?
RENE=>Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
JOE=>I knew it. I told him.
RENE=>Now what?
JOE=>We just don't stop.
JOE=>Al, Help.
AL=>Can't help you now. You're on your own.
BURR=>Give up, save yourself You're in a killing zone.
JOE=>How about a deal?
BURR=>We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
JOE=>Do something. Gimme some power. I'm in a minefield.
JOE=>What are you doing?
AL=>Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
JOE=>Al...you there, Al? Now's the time. Help us.
JOE=>He can't help us.
RENE=>Do something!
JOE=>Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
RENE=>You are, I've seen you.
JOE=>It wasn't me. It was him.
RENE=>It was you.
JOE=>He told me what to do.
RENE=>But you did it. It was you.
RENE=>I know one thing. If it wasn't you...we're in big trouble...
JOE=>It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
RENE=>If he was able, what would he say.
JOE=>He'd say..."Don't stop now.."
JOE=>Come on.
RENE=>That's twenty feet high.
JOE=>Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
JOE=>This...is stress.
JOE=>Al, this is your last chance..
BURR=>Three seconds to decide. Then we will shoot.
DIETER=>Give up! Tell Joe to give up!
BURR=>They have stolen state property.
RENE=>What a nerve!
BORDER GUARD=>What kind of property?
BURR=>I insist. Return the POD.
JOE=>Okay, if you really want it.
JOE=>Riuji?
RENE=>I told you, I work for him.
AL=>Hurry up...before this guy wakes.
RENE=>What is it?
JOE=>We're not moving fast enough for him.
AL=>I'll punch up your adrenaline...
JOE=>You leave my adrenaline alone.
AL=>Well, you should have said it in Cantonese...
RENE=>He wants to apologise.
RENE=>He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
JOE=>Yeah...I have to get away.
RENE=>I know a nice island.
