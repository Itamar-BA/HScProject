LIZZIE=>Oh, okay. Sorry.
COLONEL POWELL=>She’s already got water.
COLONEL POWELL=>Only two Hellfires? Where are the GBU-12’s?
DRIVER ONE=>How was the flight?
COLONEL POWELL=>Is the Reaper following?
STEVE=>Right. I know.
FATIMA=>The bread is ready!
DRIVER TWO=>How was the flight?
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>Ma’am. Congratulations on your new appointment.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>I am going to talk you through the capture of Susan Danford aka Ayesha Al-Hady...
COLONEL POWELL=>We have intelligence of a meeting of key members of Al-Shabaab in the suburb of Parklands - in this house here.
COLONEL POWELL=>It belongs to a man named Shahid Ahmed, an Al-Shabaab facilitator.
COLONEL POWELL=>... and his wife Ayesha Al-Hady, formerly Susan Helen Danford.
COLONEL POWELL=>We’ve been tracking them for six years. Last seen in Addis Ababa two months ago.
COLONEL POWELL=>They’re numbers four and five on our East Africa Most Wanted List. We have information that they will be in Nairobi today, using the Parklands house as a transit point for two new recruits:
CARRIE=>I just got here.
FIRST CREWMAN=>Matter of fact, yeah...
ALIA=>Fifty shillings.
WOMAN=>Afartan?
COLONEL POWELL=>Peg90, go closer for PID.
COLONEL POWELL=>Even if you use a Somali?
MUSA=>Aniga Ma agaano mana taageerayo maleeshiyada iyo Haddey si Qalden ila hadlaan ama ila dhaqmaan laakin waxaan qaadanaya fursad. Mana Aminayo qof walbo, adiganah weligaaga. Mardanbe, haku ciyaarin nin hortiisa ama dadka ii imaanaya hortooda.
CARRIE=>Isn’t she great.
COLONEL POWELL=>Good. Do that. Thank you.
MILITIA MAN=>What are you hiding?
KHALID=>A shooting game?
KHALID=>Yes sir! Yes sir!
JAMA=>Fiiri shago ma Rabtaa.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>Well, using the Reaper, we have the ability to strike a target with considerable accuracy...
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>Right... I will put that to Colonel Powell.
MATT=>Hey, another raghead...
JAMA=>Ma'ahan gad Baakadaha.
MATT=>Fuck man! Fuck!
COLONEL POWELL=>I want legal in here now!
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>I told you, they came to witness a capture, not a kill. Give me a capture option.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>Danford is a British citizen. They want her alive.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>We have to know that we are legally in the clear.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>Do we have permission to proceed?
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>This mission has the full support of both Kenya and the United States...
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>Yes! A missile fired from an RPA is part of an agreed contingency plan in circumstances like this.
WOODALE=>Tell her to wait.
MUSHTAQ=>Yes... Of course.
ESTHER=>Mr. Secretary...
COLONEL POWELL=>Lieutenant, you have clearance to prosecute the target.
ABDI=>Where have you been?
ABDI=>Waan ku daba socday !
COLONEL POWELL=>Don’t lecture me, Harold!
CARRIE=>What’s happening?
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>We have done what we can for her in the time available to us.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>It is generally understood that it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice the one in order to save the many.
JAMES=>Is that “Yes”?
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>I suggest you keep your eye on the other screen.
STEVE=>Two loaves left.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON=>For God’s sake, now we have no idea when they might leave the house.
COLONEL POWELL=>Perhaps we can target the missile here... or here...
MUSHTAQ=>Thank you, Ma’am.
COLONEL POWELL=>If you look at the diagram... By targeting the missile here, there is an estimated forty-five per cent chance of collateral fatality in this area here, where the girl is positioned.
JAMA=>Go like the wind!
COLONEL POWELL=>He’s buying the bread...
