MANZO=>It’s impossible.
MANZO=>If they do come, and we lose, what then?
YOHEI=>What will we do?
3RD LABOURER=>...you found any samurai yet - strong, willing and cheap?
MOSUKE=>What’s happening?
THIEF=>So you’ve come. Well don’t come any nearer or I’ll kill the boy. You hear me.
THIEF=>Don’t come in, I’m warning you!
THIEF=>Throw them in!
LABOURER=>What?
KAMBEI=>I understand. I accept your sacrifice.
KAMBEI=>Katsushiro!
YOHEI=>He’s coming now!
KAMBEI=>Try him.
KAMBEI=>How did you feel?
KAMBEI=>What? Oh!
LABOURER=>I’ve found a really tough samurai. We had this big fight with him and he really beat us up. I’ve never seen anyone as tough as he is. Like a wild dog. We drank together afterwards and became friends though. I asked him. He’s coming.
KATSUSHIRO=>Shall I do it again?
LABOURER=>What are you doing?
KIKUCHIYO=>Here. I’m going to show you something. Just look at this.
HEIHACHI=>Just thirteen, eh?
MOSUKE=>It’s nothing, go on home.
HEIHACHI=>Still following us!
KIKUCHIYO=>This way, this way!
HEIHACHI=>Shut up!
KAMBEI=>Well, if you were them, where would you attack?
KAMBEI=>I see. And you’d probably take this road.
KIKUCHIYO=>Hey you! I’m going to start charging admission!
KIKUCHIYO=>It’s samurai stuff.
SHICHIROJI=>Where are you going?
KIKUCHIYO=>Oh? And the circles?
SHINO=>I won’t eat it.
KATSUSHIRO=>Kyumon’s grandmother?
KIKUCHIO=>What does?
KATSUSHIRO=>Wait...you...you saw me today didn’t you? I mean, with...
KIKUCHIYO=>Shut up, you brats. We haven’t got any.
KAMBEI=>Wait!
KAMBEI=>How did you know?
HEIHACHI=>Where did they come from? The hill, or from the west?
KATSUSHIRO=>Yes, sir.
KIKUCHIYO=>They’re very good horses.
RIKICHI=>A good day’s walk.
RIKICHI=>My wife!
KIKUCHIYO=>Heihachi! Brace up!
KIKUCHIYO=>Shut up!
KATSUSHIRO=>And look out for the guns.
KAMBEI=>Come back here! Kikuchiyo!
KAMBEI=>Kikuchiyo, let’s go back.
SHICHIROJI=>Everybody all right?
KYUZO=>No, you won’t.
KATSUSHIRO=>I hear something.
KIKUCHIYO=>Yohei, look, you keep watch.
KIKUCHIYO=>Yohei! Where is Yohei?!
SHICHIROJI=>Kikuchiyo! What are you doing?
SHICHIROJI=>Katsushiro! Rikichi!
KAMBEI=>Kyuzo, well done!
KAMBEI=>Kikuchiyo, Kikuchiyo!
