JUNG=>What would he do?
JUNG=>How do you know?
SABINA=>My angel told me.
SABINA=>Will you stop that!
SABINA=>Can we go back now?
SABINA=>I need to get back.
NURSE=>Where's the knife?
JUNG=>Hello. I'm back.
JUNG=>Don't be absurd.
SABINA=>Last, last night, it suddenly whispered something in my ear, I couldn't hear what... but then... I felt it behind me... it put its hand on my waist and then...
JUNG=>Professor Freud.
FREUD=>Of course, there's the added difficulty, more ammunition for our enemies, that all of us here in Vienna, in our psychoanalytical circle, are Jews.
SABINA=>Do you like Wagner?
JUNG=>I'll do my best.
JUNG=>What do you mean?
JUNG=>Don't be absurd.
EMMA=>I have a surprise for you.
FREUD=>What in God's name was that?
JUNG=>Please sit down.
SABINA=>Then heal thyself!
SABINA=>And there's your ten francs!
FREUD=>What do you mean?
JUNG=>Wait a minute...
SABINA=>The Herr Direktor.
SABINA=>How's... Mrs. Jung?
FREUD=>As simple as that?
SABINA=>Yes, a Russian Jew.
SABINA=>Are you all right?
