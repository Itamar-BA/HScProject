MIKE=>Let me drive, then.
DARLENE=>Don't worry about it.
HYMAN=>Editorial in two!
PECK=>All right let's get going.
PECK=>Carol, what do you-
HYMAN=>Don't you have a cartoon to finish?
MULANAX=>Shit, you got one too?
NAVY PROJECT LEADER=>All right, people, listen up...
AVERY=>You're pretty good at those.
DEAR EDITOR,=>THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKING...
BRYAN=>It's a public park.
CECELIA=>There. He went behind a tree.
THE MAN=>She tied you loose, didn't she?
THE MAN=>Get down! Right now!
VALLEJO=>12-20-68 7-4-69
AVERY=>"Zaroff" with a Z?
TEENAGE GIRL=>Yeah, there's a fight! In a cab!
DAVID=>Dad, what's Zodiac?
TOSCHI=>Whoever this is, you owe me a lamp.
TOSCHI=>I was sound asleep.
TOSCHI=>So. Why don't you?
TOSCHI=>Nah, get outta here.
ARMSTRONG=>Nothing from the crowd.
TOSCHI=>Did you see his face?
PLEASE RUSH TO EDITOR=>PLEASE RUSH TO EDITOR.
MULANAX=>Can't. Skipped town.
ARMSTRONG=>Why would I call Solano?
PATROLMAN FOUKE=>We got the call to circle the scene, look for a negro-
TOSCHI=>Did you talk to him?
TOSCHI=>I know you didn't sign up for this, but we're doing everything we can-
GRAYSMITH=>Not for lack of trying.
DIRECTOR=>Sixty seconds! Clear the set!
BELLI=>Here to help, Jim.
VOICE=>No. I just have headaches.
VOICE=>I'm going to kill them! I'm going to kill all those kids!
VOICE=>I feel awful lonesomeness.
ARMSTRONG=>The operator from Oakland PD is sure the man who called her had a deeper voice. Calmer.
TOSCHI=>You're looking at it.
WOMAN=>Where's your baby?
ARMSTRONG=>This is the Zodiac speaking...
GRAYSMITH=>This is the Zodiac speaking...
GRAYSMITH=>Who am I going to tell?
TOSCHI=>Didn't you call him a "latent homosexual" in one of your articles?
MELANIE=>Yes, I saw that on TV.
MELANIE=>I think it's near L.A.
GRAYSMITH=>Yeah. What do you mean?
AVERY=>Hello? Is anyone in there?
NARLOW=>Like Kathleen Johns?
BATES HAD TO DIE=>THERE WILL BE MORE
CAPTAIN CROSS=>These and the desktop. Don?
CAPTAIN CROSS=>Also, our letters and your letters, they don't bear much resemblance.
TOSCHI=>Check stubs are a wash, cause there's so little writing on them. The application's got more, but he says it doesn't look like Z. He's not ruling him out, but he can't rule him in either.
ARMSTRONG=>Let me make a few calls.
TOSCHI=>That's a nice watch.
LEIGH ALLEN=>It's about this man who waits for people to get shipwrecked on his island because he's tired of hunting animals, so he hunts the people for the challenge.
GRAYSMITH=>It's ten in the morning.
TOSCHI=>Narlow hasn't gotten Marshall's prints yet-
ARMSTRONG=>So it's not Benson or Flowers?
ARMSTRONG=>Big fat no on Marshall-
ARMSTRONG=>But because of patient confidentiality-
CATHERINE ALLEN=>He's going to school in Santa Rosa.
CAPTAIN LEE=>Get Cheney on the record.
CAPTAIN LEE=>They're going to take you through this. I'm assuming you've got Mr. Cheney's statements?
ARMSTRONG=>Berryessa murder - The day the kids were stabbed, Allen's neighbor saw bloody knives in his truck which he claimed was used to kill a chicken.
CAPTAIN LEE=>And neither hand matches.
GRAYSMITH=>The good guy shoots him in the chest. That’s how it ends.
TOSCHI=>No, that's not it...
TOSCHI=>Dave Toschi, nice to meet you.
POLICE COMMISSIONER=>Dave! That Harry Callahan did a hell of a job closing your case, huh?
TOSCHI=>So what do you do over at the paper?
NEWSCASTER=>...has confirmed that columnist Jimmy Breslin of the New York Daily News has received a letter penned by the Son of Sam. Dubbed the .44 Caliber Killer by the press and later “Son of Sam” by himself, the killer began his rampage in 1976, targeting couples in parked cars, and communicating with authorities through a series of handwritten letters.
MELANIE=>"I am not Paul Avery."
MELANIE=>The boys need tuck-ins and the poop machine needs changing.
GRAYSMITH=>Thank you for your time.
GRAYSMITH=>So nobody cares anymore?
GRAYSMITH=>I've been doing research on the first code. Everything an amateur would need to create it can be found in these books.
MULANAX=>That's what they say.
GRAYSMITH=>I know Mulanax says they already found this guy, a George Waters. But he also says Darlene had lots of "admirers" who would come by the restaurant where she worked. When Darlene and her husband moved into their new house, they threw a painting party-
TOSCHI=>That’s good, Robert.
TOSCHI=>It is interesting you mention Zodiac calling people at home. I heard he did that in San Francisco once.
HOUSEKEEPER=>You are here about a case?
HOUSEKEEPER=>He said "I have to kill, today is my birthday" then he hangs up. Then the letter arrives.
GRAYSMITH=>So how do I confirm it?
VOICE=>Mr. Vaughn does not know his friend is a killer, and is storing some film canisters for him. In these canisters is the evidence you'll need.
VOICE=>The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.
MORRILL=>Handwriting is everything.
MORRILL=>About a month ago, a man named Wallace Penny showed up on my doorstep, very distraught. He said he knew who the Zodiac was. He gave me a name. Rick something-
POLICE RADIO=>Twenty-two call in IMMEDIATELY. Land line only.
TOSCHI=>You got it with you?
CAPTAIN LEE=>Dave, these guys are from Internal Affairs, they’re gonna need a handwriting sample.
NARLOW=>Maybe yes, maybe no.
TOSCHI=>You're a cartoonist.
VAUGHN=>You mean the symbol.
GRAYSMITH=>I've been kind of busy.
TOSCHI=>I'm calling the cops-
TOSCHI=>Robert, I know this.
GRAYSMITH=>What happened to Allen?
GRAYSMITH=>And when is he released?
TOSCHI=>I've got one question.
GRAYSMITH=>I could never find him.
GRAYSMITH=>Not really. But thanks.
