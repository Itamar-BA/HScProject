SISTER SARAH-JOAN=>There are the classics: St. Augustine, of course, and Aquinas. My favorite, Kierkegaard - wait until you hear his love story - it will make you swoon.
SISTER SARAH-JOAN=>Some of the students were disturbed by your posters.
LADY BIRD=>It’s just a bird head on a lady body or vice versa.
LADY BIRD=>That we know of YET.

LADY BIRD=>Hey! I like your band with Jonah Ruiz, L'enfance Nue?
LADY BIRD=>I saw your Thanksgiving show. My name’s Lady Bird.
LADY BIRD=>I wasn’t flirting.
SECOND SEMESTER=>INT. CHURCH. DAY. Joint liturgy at another beginning of the semester. Lady Bird sits next to Julie and sings in the choir and scans for Kyle. From under her choir robe, Lady Bird pulls out “The People’s History of the United States” and reads it while the priest delivers the homily. Danny tries to make eye contact with Lady Bird but she coldly looks away. Her eyes rest on Jenna - she wants Kyle as her boyfriend and Jenna as her friend. She wants to be part of this thing, this popular-straight-kid thing she’s always been outside of. Lady Bird takes her blessing, arms crossed. INT. HOMEROOM. DAY.
MISS PATTY=>Uh, Prospero, Danny.

LADY BIRD=>Excuse me?
LADY BIRD=>Oh Jesus.
MARION=>Hey, it’s okay, it’s okay.
MIGUEL=>Lady Bird! A bunch of things arrived for you!
LARRY=>Oh... hi, son!
SISTER SARAH-JOAN=>I’m not going to punish you.
LADY BIRD=>I wish I could get an eating disorder.
MARION=>Is it too pink?
LADY BIRD=>But do you like me?
LADY BIRD=>I think, yes, I am.
SHELLY=>Have a good time!
MIGUEL=>Yeah, good luck!
KYLE=>You look good.
LADY BIRD=>Yeah, okay. No prom.
KYLE=>Um, okay? I mean I don’t really wanna do that.
LADY BIRD=>Why are you crying?
DANNY=>... now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardoned be, let your indulgence set me free.
LADY BIRD=>I didn’t walk weird!
LADY BIRD=>Mom. Mom. Aren’t you sort of proud that I’m so close to getting in? Just a little?
LADY BIRD=>Please, Mom, please I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you - I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, I’m ungrateful and I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry I wanted more...

LADY BIRD=>You aren't coming?
MARION=>You can't walk up to the gate anymore, anyway.
COLLEGE=>INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT. Lady Bird unpacks, putting things in their places. She reaches in the front pocket of her suitcase and pulls out: A manila envelope. She opens it, and all these letters fall out - crumpled up starts and half-starts. She looks at all of them one at a time. They all begin essentially the same: “I love you so much and I don’t know how to tell you that, I can’t communicate it to you in a way that ...”
LADY BIRD=>I wouldn’t do that.
COLLEGE BOY=>I’m David.
COLLEGE BOY=>No, my name is David.
DAVID=>Oh, god, oh god!
