RICHARD=>You feeling better Franny?
FRANCESCA=>Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
DINAH WASHINGTON=>"I'LL CLOSE MY EYES... TO EVERYONE BUT YOU... AND WHEN I DO... I'LL SEE
RICHARD=>What station is this?
FRANCESCA=>It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
RICHARD=>Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
FRANCESCA=>I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
RICHARD=>Sure.
RICHARD=>Your mother isn't feel well. I want you to help her out tonight with dinner. Tell Michael to put this feed away.
MICHAEL=>Dad! You bought the wrong feed!
RICHARD=>What?!
FRANCESCA=>So what are you going to do with the prize money?
CAROLYN=>I don't know. I might save up for one of those hi-fi stereo players like Peggy has.
FRANCESCA=>Are you seeing Betty tonight?
MICHAEL=>Nah.
RICHARD=>Oh! Frannie, is this yours?
FRANCESCA=>You found it! I got my dress caught on that damn gate. You must have eyes like a hawk.
RICHARD=>'Bout 4:30.
FRANCESCA=>Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
CAROLYN=>Mom!
MICHAEL=>Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
CAROLYN=>Mom's orders.
MICHAEL=>Lawyer here?
CAROLYN=>I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
BETTY=>No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
MICHAEL=>I nearly died when we split the bill.
BETTY=>Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
MICHAEL=>Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
BETTY=>Boy. It sure has been a long time.
MICHAEL=>We were here two Christmases ago.
BETTY=>Well, that's a long time.
MICHAEL=>It's not that long.
BETTY=>Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
MICHAEL=>SO!
BETTY=>You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
MICHAEL=>Oh Jesus.
BETTY=>I simply can not stand that tone!
CAROLYN=>Come inside. You're just tired from the trip.
BETTY=>I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
CAROLYN=>I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
MICHAEL=>He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
CAROLYN=>He's not coming.
BETTY=>Aw, is he still cheating on you, hon?
LAWYER=>Just sign here as having received the contents from the safe deposit box. And this one, which clears the bank of all further responsibility fo0r the contents.
BETTY=>This is kind of exciting. You think we'll find out your mother had secret millions lying around?
LAWYER=>All right. Why don't we begin.
MICHAEL=>I thought everything WAS arranged.
CAROLYN=>Well, there's a problem.
MICHAEL=>What problem?
LAWYER=>Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
MICHAEL=>Cremated?!
BETTY=>Eeeww!
CAROLYN=>I know. I don't understand it either.
MICHAEL=>When did she decide this?
LAWYER=>Apparently just before her death.
MICHAEL=>Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
BETTY=>My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
MICHAEL=>Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
LAWYER=>It clearly states in the will --
MICHAEL=>I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
LAWYER=>Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
MICHAEL=>WHAT!
BETTY=>How bizarre!
CAROLYN=>Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
LAWYER=>Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
MICHAEL=>Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
CAROLYN=>I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
MICHAEL=>Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
BETTY=>Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
MICHAEL=>We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
BETTY=>Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
MICHAEL=>Doesn't matter. Move on.
LAWYER=>Well, we'll come back to that. Shall we open the box?
CAROLYN=>Michael, look -- I've never seen this picture of mama. Have you?
BETTY=>She's not wearing a bra. This is Roseman Bridge in case anyone's interested.
BETTY=>It's a beautiful picture of her.
MICHAEL=>Why are there two deeds here?
LAYER=>One of for the original parcel your father bought and this one is for the additional acres he purchased in '59.
MICHAEL=>And this?
LAWYER=>Those are bills of sale from the equipment your mother sold in ..
BETTY=>What's that?
CAROLYN=>Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
BETTY=>No treasure maps, huh?
CAROLYN=>No.
MICHAEL=>Yeah.
CAROLYN=>Michael.
MICHAEL=>What?!
CAROLYN=>Come here a minute.
MICHAEL=>What? Where are we going?
BETTY=>Did she say anything in there about me? Leaving me anything in particular?
LAWYER=>No.
BETTY=>I didn't expect so. She never liked me. It's okay. I always knew. Thought we married too young. Nobody broke his arm -- that's what I said but you know mothers and their sons. Also, she never liked the fact of us moving to Florida although what's where the opportunities were. Couldn't deny that. Suppose we should have visited more but you know she hardly ever made an effort to come to Tampa. Not even to see her grandchildren. She was a cold woman. They say Italians are hot-blooded but not her. She was cool as ice. She leaves these to anyone?
MICHAEL=>Um... we were just wondering how it might be better if me and Carolyn went over the stuff by ourselves. Not keep you two waiting around. I'll contact your office about the legal work.
BETTY=>I don't mind waiting.
MICHAEL=>Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
BETTY=>Well, I can help.
MICHAEL=>I said NO!
BETTY=>I do not need instructions from you to bathe! I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come! Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
CAROLYN=>Aw, Betty.
BETTY=>Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
CAROLYN=>No. You can have them.
MICHAEL=>Now what's this about?
CAROLYN=>"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
MICHAEL=>Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
MICHAEL=>What's he saying now?
CAROLYN=>Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is... I love you... Robert.
MICHAEL=>Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
CAROLYN=>That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is. From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
MICHAEL=>What?
CAROLYN=>That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
MICHAEL=>DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
MICHAEL=>Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
CAROLYN=>I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
MICHAEL=>This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it. You think she had sex with him?
CAROLYN=>My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
MICHAEL=>Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
CAROLYN=>Don't say that!
MICHAEL=>Well, what am I supposed to think?
CAROLYN=>I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
MICHAEL=>How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
CAROLYN=>No, I don't think so. I --
CAROLYN/MICHAEL=>You read it!
CAROLYN=>"January, 1987. Dear Carolyn. I hope you're reading this with Michael. I'm sure he wouldn't be able to read it by himself and he'll need some help understanding all this, especially the parts about me having sex..."
MICHAEL=>I can't believe she's making jokes.
CAROLYN=>Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose. But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
MICHAEL=>Grateful!?
CAROLYN=>"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
MICHAEL=>That's it!
CAROLYN=>What are you doing?
MICHAEL=>This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
CAROLYN=>Well, I'd like to read them.
MICHAEL=>No. We're going to lock this up and --
CAROLYN STOP IT!=>I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
CAROLYN=>"I suppose his coming into my life was, in many ways, prepared for weeks, maybe even months before. There was a restlessness I feeling. Out of the blue and for no apparent reason. There's nothing more frightening to a woman whose been settled down for almost twenty years than to suddenly feel unsettled. I don't know when it started ... I do remember one night in particular, a little over a week before Robert arrived..."
FRANCESCA=>"It was late at night after a long day. Your father was tired -- fighting all afternoon with that new equipment Robert Harrison convinced him to buy. But I wasn't tired. Lately, I could hardly sleep more than two hours a night. I was reading some John O'Hara novel, skimming the words, turning the pages without absorbing what I was reading. My mind was far away. And no matter how I tried, I couldn't call it back."
RICHARD=>What time is it?
FRANCESCA=>Later. Go back to sleep.
RICHARD=>Where you going?
FRANCESCA=>I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
RICHARD=>Now?! It's after eleven.
FRANCESCA=>I can't sleep.
RICHARD=>Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
FRANCESCA=>I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
RICHARD=>If you're not sick, how can it be contagious?
FRANCESCA=>Damn it! Shit!
FRANCESCA=>"Niccolo. I couldn't remember the last time I had seen that face. And then the memories wouldn't stop. Like an avalanche..."
NICCOLO=>Francesca! Francesca! Where the hell are you going?
FRANCESCA=>Leave me alone!
NICCOLO=>You play these games and I'm supposed to follow -- run after you like a schoolboy. Well, I'm not! I'm fed up!
FRANCESCA=>So that's it! You just give up!
NICCOLO=>What "give up"? You agreed with them! Mommy and Daddy said stay away from me and you said all right. What am I supposed to do?
FRANCESCA=>Fight for me!
NICCOLO=>ENOUGH! You don't know what you want! Stop looking for me to tell you! STOP IT!
FRANCESCA=>"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
RICHARD=>Frannie.
FRANCESCA=>"The following week was the Illinos State Fair. The two of you were going with dad to exhibit Carolyn's prize steer. It was the Sunday night you left. I know it sounds awful but I couldn't wait for you all to leave. You were going to be gone until Friday. Four days... Just four days..."
FRANCESCA=>Michael, what did I tell you about that door?
FRANCESCA=>You excited about going, Carolyn?
MICHAEL=>Okay.
FRANCESCA=>What's her name?
MICHAEL=>Betty.
FRANCESCA=>What's she like?
MICHAEL=>Okay.
FRANCESCA=>Do you like her?
MICHAEL=>Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
FRANCESCA=>Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
MICHAEL=>Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
FRANCESCA=>Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
RICHARD=>We better get moving. You sure you don't want to come?
FRANCESCA=>I'm positive.
RICHARD=>I'm going to miss you.
FRANCESCA=>It's only four days.
ELEANOR=>Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
HENRY=>They got heat in Michigan.
ELEANOR=>Not this kind of heat.
HENRY=>Heat is heat.
ELEANOR=>Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
HENRY=>I'll get right on it.
GLADYS=>Mrs. Delaney. Did you hear the latest?
ELEANOR=>No, what?
GRADYS=>Apparently, she caught them. Ran right into them in Des Moines in the middle of her shopping.
ELEANOR=>Oh, what a horror. Poor woman. That Redfield girl's got no business showing her face in daylight.
GRADYS=>I don't know how that tramp stands living here. No one can bear even speaking to her. She has no friends.
HENRY=>Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
ELEANOR=>Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
MRS. DELANEY=>Just coffee, please.
GLADYS=>See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
ELEANOR=>I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
GLADYS=>I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
ELEANOR=>Francesca! So, everybody got off okay last night?
FRANCESCA=>Yes, thanks.
GLADYS=>What you going to do all alone for four days -- a woman of leisure?
FRANCESCA=>Oh, you know there's always something to be done. Have a good day. Henry.
ELEANOR=>She's changed.
GLADYS=>Oh, yes.
ELEANOR=>She used to be so friendly.
HENRY=>Maybe she's going through "the changes."
ELEANOR=>What do you know about "the changes"?
HENRY=>Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
ELEANOR=>Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
GLADYS=>My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
ELEANOR=>No. What a tragedy. What happened?
GLADYS=>She changed.
MRS. DELANEY=>Excuse me for a moment, I left something in the car.
WAITRESS=>Poor woman.
REPORTER=>Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
FRANCESCA=>Yes. And I've accepted.
REPORTER=>What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
FRANCESCA=>I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
REPORTER=>What about your husband?
FRANCESCA=>I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
ROBERT=>Sorry to bother you, but I've got a feeling I'm lost.
FRANCESCA=>Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
ROBERT=>Yeah.
FRANCESCA:=>Well, you're not that lost.
ROBERT=>I'm looking for a covered bridge out this way... uh... wait a minute --
FRANCESCA=>Roseman Bridge?
ROBERT=>That's it.
FRANCESCA=>Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
ROBERT=>Oh, terrific. Which way?
FRANCESCA=>Well, I can take you if you want.
ROBERT=>Well --
FLOYD=>Howdy, Francesca.
FRANCESCA=>Hey, Floyd.
ROBERT=>If I'm not taking you away from anything.
FRANCESCA=>No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait. I just have to get my shoes.
ROBERT=>I wasn't expect company. Let me get this out of the way.
FRANCESCA=>Out, then right.
ROBERT=>Pretty country.
FRANCESCA=>Hmm-mmm.
ROBERT=>There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
FRANCESCA=>No.
ROBERT=>I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
FRANCESCA=>Maybe it's because I live here.
ROBERT=>That must be it. It's a great smell.
FRANCESCA=>Are you from Washington originally?
ROBERT=>Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
FRANCESCA=>Oh. When did you move back?
ROBERT=>After the divorce.
FRANCESCA=>Oh.
ROBERT=>How long you been married?
FRANCESCA=>Uh... uh... Umm... long time.
ROBERT=>You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
FRANCESCA=>No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
ROBERT=>Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
FRANCESCA=>Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
ROBERT=>Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
FRANCESCA=>No, really?
ROBERT=>Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
FRANCESCA=>You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
ROBERT=>Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
ROBERT=>Like one?
FRANCESCA=>Sure.
ROBERT=>So, how long you've been living here?
FRANCESCA=>Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
ROBERT=>Yeah.
ROBERT=>This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
FRANCESCA=>I don't mind waiting.
ROBERT=>Is it always this hot?
FRANCESCA=>This time of year.
ROBERT=>Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
FRANCESCA=>Oh there you are.
ROBERT=>Oh! You caught me.
ROBERT=>Thanks for your help.
ROBERT=>Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
FRANCESCA=>No, not at all -- except those are poisonous.
ROBERT=>WHAT!
FRANCESCA=>I'm sorry. I was kidding.
FRANCESCA=>I'm sorry. I don't know what -- I'm sorry. Really. They're lovely.
ROBERT=>Are you by nature a sadistic person?
FRANCESCA=>No, I'm not. I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just... Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
FRANCESCA=>What with those riots in Los Angeles and people burning draft cards and ... Adlai Stevenson dying last month.
ROBERT=>Shouldn't let things get to you so much.
FRANCESCA=>Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
ROBERT=>I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute... Here it is.
FRANCESCA=>Oh, that's nice.
ROBERT=>Want another cigarette?
FRANCESCA=>Sure.
ROBERT=>Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
FRANCESCA=>Francesca.
ROBERT=>Francesca. Robert.
FRANCESCA=>Would you like some iced tea?
FRANCESCA=>Lemon?
ROBERT=>Sure.
FRANCESCA=>Would you like another one?
ROBERT=>Mind if I smoke?
FRANCESCA=>Not at all.
ROBERT=>Sure you want to keep those in the house?
FRANCESCA=>I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
ROBERT=>I thought it was funny.
FRANCESCA=>Where are you staying while you're here?
ROBERT=>A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
FRANCESCA=>And how long are you here for?
ROBERT=>As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
FRANCESCA=>My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
ROBERT=>Oh. How old?
FRANCESCA=>About a year and a half.
ROBERT=>No, your kids.
FRANCESCA=>Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
ROBERT=>Must be nice having kids.
FRANCESCA=>Not any more. It's awful. They're awful. I can't stand them.
ROBERT=>Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
FRANCESCA=>I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
ROBERT=>I doubt that.
FRANCESCA=>Why?
ROBERT=>Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
FRANCESCA=>Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
ROBERT=>What's he like?
RICHARD=>Franny, could you clean out my boil again?
FRANCESCA=>He's very... clean.
ROBERT=>Clean?
FRANCESCA=>No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
ROBERT=>And clean.
FRANCESCA=>Yes. Very clean.
ROBERT=>So you must like Oiwa, I guess.
FRANCESCA=>It's... uh... uh...
ROBERT=>Go ahead. I won't tell anyone.
FRANCESCA=>It's...
I...=>I hate it!
(CONTINUES MOS IF=>NEEDED)
ROBERT=>Feeling better?
FRANCESCA=>Much.
ROBERT=>Is the dizziness gone?
FRANCESCA=>I think so.
ROBERT=>I better go. You sure you're all right? It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
FRANCESCA=>I feel so embarrassed.
ROBERT=>Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
FRANCESCA=>But I... We don't even know each other.
ROBERT=>You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
FRANCESCA=>Would you like to stay for dinner? There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
ROBERT=>That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
FRANCESCA=>This is ridiculous. Stupid!
ROBERT=>I'm just going to put some of this film in your fridge. Heat isn't too forgiving out there.
FRANCESCA=>Help cook?
ROBERT=>Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
FRANCESCA=>Okay.
ROBERT=>... No, wait, it gets better.
FRANCESCA=>What?
ROBERT=>She starts sniffing me.
FRANCESCA=>Oh my God... You're blushing.
ROBERT=>It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
FRANCESCA=>Then what happened?
ROBERT=>We got engaged.
FRANCESCA=>Oh you!
ROBERT=>No, it is. Except for the engagement part. She wouldn't have me, although I still get a Valentine every year.
FRANCESCA=>You ought to write these stories down.
ROBERT=>Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
FRANCESCA=>"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
ROBERT=>I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
FRANCESCA=>Why, do you think?
ROBERT=>I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
FRANCESCA=>You sound like an artist.
ROBERT=>No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
FRANCESCA=>I don't think you're normal.
FRANCESCA=>I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
ROBERT=>Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on. Did you love teaching?
ROBERT=>And did you?
FRANCESCA=>I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
ROBERT=>Why did you stop?
FRANCESCA=>My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
ROBERT=>Do you miss it?
FRANCESCA=>I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
ROBERT=>You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
ROBERT=>I'm sorry. That was...
FRANCESCA=>No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
ROBERT=>This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
ROBERT=>Let's see -- my favorite place...
ROBERT=>Get us closer!!
FRANCESCA=>My God. How I'd love to see that.
ROBERT=>They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
FRANCESCA=>Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
ROBERT=>Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
FRANCESCA=>You drink bug repellent?
ROBERT=>No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
FRANCESCA=>Smells like dirt.
ROBERT=>You get used to it.
FRANCESCA=>When?
ROBERT=>You want to go back in?
FRANCESCA=>No. I'm all right. It's working.
ROBERT=>You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
FRANCESCA=>What?
ROBERT=>This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
FRANCESCA=>Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
ROBERT=>I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is... ... so much beauty.
FRANCESCA=>Would you like some coffee? Or maybe, some brandy?
ROBERT=>How about both?
ROBERT=>You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
FRANCESCA=>No. I'll do them later.
ROBERT=>Francesca?
FRANCESCA=>What?
ROBERT=>Are you all right?
FRANCESCA=>Yes.
ROBERT=>Francesca?
FRANCESCA=>What?
ROBERT=>We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
MICHAEL=>He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
CAROLYN=>Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
MICHAEL=>Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
CAROLYN=>I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married. At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
MICHAEL=>I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
CAROLYN=>Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
MICHAEL=>Then why do you?
CAROLYN=>And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
MICHAEL=>Let's go into town and get a bite. We'll take the books with us.
FRANCESCA=>"We sat sipping brandy. I thought if anybody walked through the door now there'd be no explaining it. But I didn't care. And I loved that I didn't care. I almost wanted it to happen. Then there'd be no turning back. I wanted to be like him. I lived this life of his. We talked about his wife and I was jealous -- not of her -- but of his leaving. His fearlessness. He knew what he wanted. How did he do that.
FRANCESCA=>Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
ROBERT=>Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
FRANCESCA=>So what happened?
ROBERT=>I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
FRANCESCA=>You must get lonely at times.
ROBERT=>Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
FRANCESCA=>Woman friends, too?
ROBERT=>I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
FRANCESCA=>You really don't need anyone?
ROBERT=>No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
FRANCESCA=>Why doesn't it scare you?
ROBERT=>I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
FRANCESCA=>Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
ROBERT=>No.
FRANCESCA=>Do you ever regret not having a family?
ROBERT=>Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
FRANCESCA=>But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
ROBERT=>I told you, I love other people.
FRANCESCA=>But no one in particular.
ROBERT=>No. But I love them just the same.
FRANCESCA=>But it's not the same.
ROBERT=>That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
FRANCESCA=>No, I'm just saying --
ROBERT=>I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
FRANCESCA=>Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
ROBERT=>Do you want to leave your husband?
FRANCESCA=>No. Of course not.
ROBERT=>My mistake. I apologize.
FRANCESCA=>What made you ask such a question?
ROBERT=>I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
FRANCESCA=>I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
ROBERT=>I already apologized.
FRANCESCA=>Listen, I'm sorry I --
ROBERT=>No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
FRANCESCA=>... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
ROBERT=>It's been a perfect evening. Just the way it is. Thank you.
FRANCESCA=>Hello?
FRANCESCA=>Richard, hi.
FRANCESCA=>Fine. Everyone settled in okay?
FRANCESCA=>Uh-uh... good... Hmmm...
ROBERT=>... and then she tacks this note on the bridge asking me to have dinner with her again!
ZULU=>How pathetic.
FRANCESCA=>Hello?
ROBERT=>Francesca?
FRANCESCA=>Yes! Hi.
ROBERT=>Am I interrupting anything?
FRANCESCA=>No. I was just... No.
ROBERT=>I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
FRANCESCA=>The light was fading. Huh-huh.
ROBERT=>I would love to come for dinner.
FRANCESCA=>Wonderful. Uh...
ROBERT=>Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
FRANCESCA=>Oh, sure. Great.
ROBERT=>I'll pick you up.
FRANCESCA=>No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
ROBERT=>Okay. See you later.
FRANCESCA=>Yeah. See you later.
WIFE=>Thelma told me he checked into the Motor Inn and the bill goes to National Geographic Magazine.
HUSBAND=>National Geographic? What the hell's he doing here? We ain't got no naked pygmies to take pictures of.
WIFE=>He's taking pictures of the bridges.
HUSBAND=>Ain't no pygmies there either.
WAITRESS=>God. It's Lucy Redfield.
ROBERT=>Got room right here if you like.
REDFIELD WOMAN=>Thank you.
ROBERT=>Hot out there today.
WAITRESS=>Well, are you ordering anything!?
REDFIELD WOMAN=>No. Thank you. I've changed my mind.
SECOND WAITRESS=>I'd've thrown that water right in her face.
WAITRESS=>Poor Mrs. Delaney.
CASHIER=>That all?
ROBERT=>Isn't it awful about poor Mrs. Delaney?
CASHIER=>Tragic is more like it. The pain that woman has been subjected to by that no-good husband. I never liked him. Known him for years. People say he's quiet. Well, it's the quiet ones that can sneak up behind you and stab you in the back. I heard yesterday, that she confronted him. Gave him the ultimatum and you know what he did?--
FRANCESCA=>Ready. You have the keys?
SALESWOMAN=>How about this one?
FRANCESCA=>I don't know. I haven't bought a dress for myself in so long. I mean, I'm just buying a dress. It's not a special occasion or anything. I'm just shopping. Just shopping for a new dress, that's all.
SALESWOMAN=>That might work. And if he's still mad, just tell him you could have done better but you married him out of pity. That's always works for me.
FRANCESCA=>Hello?
ROBERT=>It's Robert.
FRANCESCA=>Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
ROBERT=>Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
FRANCESCA=>Oh.
ROBERT=>I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
FRANCESCA=>Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
ROBERT=>The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
FRANCESCA=>I think he's running for town crier next year.
ROBERT=>I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage. Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or...
FRANCESCA=>I understand. That's very kind of you.
ROBERT=>Yeah?
FRANCESCA=>I want you to come.
ROBERT=>All right. See you there.
FRANCESCA=>Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
ROBERT=>Oh, how is he?
FRANCESCA=>Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
ROBERT=>Couple. Want to help?
FRANCESCA=>Well, I have plumbing at my house.
ROBERT=>Can I help?
FRANCESCA=>Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
ROBERT=>How about if I set the table?
FRANCESCA=>Sure.
ROBERT=>Would you like a beer for your bath?
FRANCESCA=>Yes, that'd be nice.
FRANCESCA=>What's wrong?
ROBERT=>Absolutely nothing. You're just sort of a knockout in that dress.
FRANCESCA=>Table looks beautiful.
ROBERT=>You're shaking. Are you cold?
FRANCESCA=>Nobody's asking you to.
CAROLYN=>What's the matter?
MICHAEL=>I'm going to get some air.
CAROLYN=>Can I smoke here?
ROBERT=>Are you comfortable? Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
FRANCESCA=>No. I can't. Not yet.
ROBERT=>You want to eat something?
FRANCESCA=>Are you hungry?
ROBERT=>No.
FRANCESCA=>Take me somewhere.
ROBERT=>What?
FRANCESCA=>Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
ROBERT=>How about Italy?
FRANCESCA=>Yes.
ROBERT=>How about Bari?
FRANCESCA=>Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
ROBERT=>Have you ever been to that station?
FRANCESCA=>Yes.
ROBERT=>You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
ROBERT=>Do you have anymore of the stew?
FRANCESCA=>Oh, I'm sorry.
ROBERT=>It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
FRANCESCA=>I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
ROBERT=>Why?
FRANCESCA=>Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
ROBERT=>Nobody's asking you to.
FRANCESCA=>And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
ROBERT=>I sat outside and had coffee.
FRANCESCA=>Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
ROBERT=>Near the church.
FRANCESCA=>I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
CAROLYN=>Can I get another cup of coffee, please?
MICHAEL=>Bar across the street.
CAROLYN=>Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.
MICHAEL=>I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
CAROLYN=>Yeah. But I thought she died.
MICHAEL=>He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
CAROLYN=>You mean -- she didn't like sex?
MICHAEL=>I bet mom could've helped her.
CAROLYN=>Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
MICHAEL=>Not yet. You want to go?
CAROLYN=>I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
MICHAEL=>I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
CAROLYN=>You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
MICHAEL=>Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
CAROLYN=>I never knew that.
MICHAEL=>Nobody did.
CAROLYN=>Was this during Betty?
MICHAEL=>Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
CAROLYN=>Did we want to?
MICHAEL=>Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
CAROLYN=>What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
MICHAEL=>Carolyn!
CAROLYN=>-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
MICHAEL=>What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
CAROLYN=>You're right -- that is sick.
MICHAEL=>If she was so unhappy, why didn't she leave?
CAROLYN=>She just made him perform oral sex on the porch.
MICHAEL=>"I'd never had a man make love to me that way before." Oh Jesus. "I couldn't believe the feelings bursting inside of me. As if I had opened some forbidden Pandora's box."
FRANCESCA=>"It seems, thinking about it now, that in those few days I lived a completely different life as a completely different woman. What was recognizable as me before Robert was gone. We decided to spend Wednesday away from Winterset. Away from Madison County. Away from pastures and bridges and people too familiar and reminders too painful. We let the day take us where it wanted..."
FRANCESCA=>On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
ROBERT=>He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
FRANCESCA=>I bet you could do a book.
ROBERT=>No. I couldn't.
FRANCESCA=>Why do you say that?
ROBERT=>Because I already tried once.
FRANCESCA=>But you don't mind.
ROBERT=>No, I don't mind.
FRANCESCA=>What were you like when you were younger?
ROBERT=>Trouble. Why?
FRANCESCA=>I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
ROBERT=>I had a temper.
FRANCESCA=>What were your parents like?
ROBERT=>I can't do this, honey.
FRANCESCA=>What?
ROBERT=>Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.
FRANCESCA=>Excuse me a minute.
ROBERT=>You're somewhere else, where?
FRANCESCA=>Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
ROBERT=>Uh-huh. And?
FRANCESCA=>You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
ROBERT=>Check, please.
MOTHER=>REBECCA! REBECCA!
MOTHER=>REBECCA!
MOTHER=>Oh my God...!
FRANCESCA=>What happened?
MOTHER=>I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
ROBERT=>I'll check down here. Someone call the police.
FRANCESCA=>Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
MOTHER=>I don't remember!
MOTHER=>She was right outside. I turned my head for a second.
POLICEMAN=>When was this?
FRANCESCA=>About an hour ago.
MOTHER=>They're not going to find her!
FRANCESCA=>Yes, they are.
MOTHER=>REBECCA!
FRANCESCA=>Where was she?
ROBERT=>Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
MOTHER=>You crossed the street by yourself?!
REBECCA=>It was a green light.
MOTHER=>Thank you so much!
ROBERT=>I need a drink.
ROBERT=>I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
FRANCESCA=>Long day. Go to sleep.
ROBERT=>Am I too heavy for you?
FRANCESCA=>No.
FRANCESCA=>Sleep all right?
ROBERT=>Yes, thanks.
FRANCESCA=>Good. More coffee? Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
ROBERT=>What?
FRANCESCA=>Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
ROBERT=>I... What do you want?
FRANCESCA=>Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
ROBERT=>Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
FRANCESCA=>Well, what is this?
ROBERT=>Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
FRANCESCA=>To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
ROBERT=>I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
FRANCESCA=>Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand. Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
ROBERT=>What are you doing?
FRANCESCA=>Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
ROBERT=>How do you know what I experience?
FRANCESCA=>I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning - "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
ROBERT=>Stop it!
FRANCESCA=>You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
ROBERT=>What do you want me to say?
FRANCESCA=>I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
ROBERT=>STOP IT!
FRANCESCA=>Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
ROBERT=>I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
FRANCESCA=>No one's asking you to!
ROBERT=>I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
FRANCESCA=>You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
ROBERT=>I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
FRANCESCA=>WHY?
ROBERT=>BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
FRANCESCA=>WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
ROBERT=>If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
FRANCESCA=>What makes it different, Robert?
ROBERT=>Because... if I even think about tomorrow -- if I... even think about leaving here without you -- I'm not sure I can... that I -
FRANCESCA=>Oh God... what are we going to do?
ROBERT=>Behind the barn. I better go.
FRANCESCA=>Madge?
MADGE=>Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said - "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious? He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
MADGE=>... I said to her, "what's the point of summer school if all he's going to do are these art projects. The boy needs so much work in math and his spelling is a nightmare...
FRANCESCA=>Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
MADGE=>Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
MADGE=>... without one lesson. The instructor couldn't believe it. So, who knows -- she may have talent. How's Carolyn doing? What are her plans for next year?
FRANCESCA=>I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
MADGE=>You want me to call the doctor?
FRANCESCA=>No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
MADGE=>No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
FRANCESCA=>No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
MADGE=>Oh, that'll be nice.
ROBERT=>Come with me.
FRANCESCA=>Hold me.
FRANCESCA=>Michael, get off the back of that chair! What did I tell you!
FRANCESCA=>All you all right, honey. Let me see...
CAROLYN=>Mama, look -- look at the dress Aunt Patty sent!
RICHARD=>Franny, BONNAZA's on!
ROBERT=>Francesca?
ROBERT=>Would you like a beer?
FRANCESCA=>Yes. I'd like that.
ROBERT=>Tell me why you're not coming with me?
FRANCESCA=>No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
ROBERT=>For who?
FRANCESCA=>For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
ROBERT=>Then he can move! People move!
FRANCESCA=>His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
ROBERT=>The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
FRANCESCA=>No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
ROBERT=>What about us? What about me?
FRANCESCA=>You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
ROBERT=>Yeah. It could get better.
FRANCESCA=>No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
ROBERT=>Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
FRANCESCA=>We are the choices we've made, Robert.
ROBERT=>TO HELL WITH YOU!
FRANCESCA=>Robert. Please. You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
ROBERT=>But now that you have it -
FRANCESCA=>I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
ROBERT=>Don't leave me. Don't leave me alone. Please.
FRANCESCA=>I don't know. Please...
ROBERT=>I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
FRANCESCA=>No. Don't do this.
ROBERT=>I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
FRANCESCA=>Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
FRANCESCA=>Keep going. Please.
ROBERT=>I forgot to take your picture.
FRANCESCA=>You all came home. And with you, my life of details.
FRANCESCA=>A day or two past and with each thought of him, a task would present itself like a life saver, pulling me further and further away from those four days.
FRANCESCA=>I was grateful. I felt safe.
FRANCESCA=>Want anything special for dinner?
RICHARD=>Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
FRANCESCA=>Okay.
FRANCESCA=>For a moment, I didn't know where I was. And for a split second, the thought crossed my mind that he really didn't want me -- that it was easy to walk away.
MICHAEL=>Dad! You bought the wrong feed!
RICHARD=>What!?
FRANCESCA=>Hi. I'm Francesca Johnson. I just feel awful I haven't come to visit sooner. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Is it too late?
LUCY=>No. Not at all.
FRANCESCA=>I was wondering if... maybe you'd like some company. I baked a cake!
LUCY=>Uh... sure. Please. Come in. I'll make coffee.
MICHAEL=>"We became inseparable, Lucy and I. The funny thing is, I didn't tell her about Robert until years later. But, for some reason, being with her somehow made me feel it was safe to think about him. To continue loving him. The town loved talking about the two of us but we didn't care. And neither did your father. Which I thought was a lovely thing. I received Robert's letter and my photograph soon after. I always wondered if your father found them. I was never quite sure..."
RICHARD=>Oh, Franny, is this yours?
FRANCESCA=>I almost told him. In that moment I felt as if I couldn't hold it back. If he really loved me maybe he'd understand.
CAROLYN=>Mom?
FRANCESCA=>Better?
RICHARD=>Franny?
FRANCESCA=>Hmm?
RICHARD=>I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
FRANCESCA=>After your father died, I tried to get in touch with Robert but found out he had left the National Geographic soon after the Madison County. No one seemed to know where he was. My only connections to him were the places we'd been to that one day. And so each week, I'd re-visit them.
FRANCESCA=>And then one day, I received the letter from his attorney, with a package.
ROBERT=>"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods... There is a rapture on the lonely shore... There is society where none intrudes... By the deep sea and music in its roar... I love not man the less, but Nature more... From these our interviews, in which I steal... From all I may be, or have been before... To mingle with the Universe and feel... What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal."
FRANCESCA=>There has not been a day since that I have not thought of him. When he said we were no longer two people, he was right.
FRANCESCA=>We were bound together as tightly as two people can be. If it hadn't been for him, I don't think I would have lasted on the farm all these years. Remember that dress of mine you wanted, Carolyn -- the one you said I never wore. Well, I know I was silly. But to me, it was as if you were asking to wear my wedding dress to go to the movies.
FRANCESCA=>After reading all this, I hope you can now understand my burial request. It was not the ravings of some mad old lady. I gave my life to my family. I wish to give Robert what is left of me.
CHILDREN=>Hey, Dad!
BETTY=>You have been out all night long! Do I have a right to ask where you've been or is this a family secret?
MICHAEL=>No. No more secrets.
CAROLYN=>Hi, Steve? It's me. Good. You?... Listen, we have to talk... Well, how about you?... Uh, no -- I've decided I'm going to stay for a while... I don't know how long... No, I won't be coming back... I'm not angry, Steve. I'm not angry at all.
FRANCESCA=>"I gave Lucy his photography book. If you're interested, take a look. If my words still leave something unclear, perhaps his pictures can illuminate. After all, that's what an artist does best... "
FRANCESCA=>"I love you both with all my heart. Do what you have to, to be happy in this life. There is so much beauty."
