JOE=>Thanks, Dad.
MIKE=>Don’t worry about that. We’re a broad church. JOE
JOE=>I mean, my last train’s actually not for ages -
MARK=>It’s a support group, Steph. Not a Skiffle band.
MIKE=>Let’s have a show of hands, shall we? Who’s in?
MARK=>Come on, Gethin. You’re supposed to be a bookshop.
GETHIN=>Jesus Christ -
GETHIN=>I haven’t been back there in sixteen years.
JEFF=>Maybe we should try and look more obviously gay.
MIKE=>Are you sure?
DAI=>That’s true.
DAI=>Well spotted. MARK
MARK’S VOICE=>Thank you. Right. Listen. Some of you know me - My name is Mark Ashton -
MARK=>Never be afraid of the grand gesture, Mike.
MIKE=>I was more afraid of getting my head kicked in.
DAI=>In politics?
GAIL=>None of us do.
SIAN=>You think so?
JOE=>Choux pastry.
STELLA=>How do you know? REGGIE
MIKE=>What are you going to do when you get to Wales?
STEPH=>There’s no need to make it personal, Mike.
SIAN=>Not now, Gwen. GWEN
REGGIE=>I just think - If everybody takes it easy on the -
RAY=>Flamboyance.
HEFINA=>What’s going on?
MARK=>It’s alright -
70A=>JEFF’S talking to DEBBIE THOMAS, the welfare’s bar-maid and the MINER’S WIFE.
75A=>- A pair of net curtains. It’s MAUREEN. She steps back from the window quickly.
MAN’S VOICE=>I don’t know why you’re so het up. They’re going in the morning.
SIAN=>Considering?
JOE=>This is fine.
JONATHAN=>Hang on a minute.
JOE=>It was the best experience of my entire life.
CLIFF=>Well, blow me.
MINER’S WIFE=>As we come marching, marching in the beauty of the day, A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray, Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses, For the people hear us singing: "Bread and roses! Bread and roses!"
HEFINA=>And what about you? What words have you said to her?
UNION MAN=>It’ll have to go to a vote.
MIKE=>Mark, listen -
CLIFF=>Get in the car. HEFINA
MARK=>Yes. You. The cute one.
MARK=>And the vote? DAI
CARL=>We’re miners.
138A=>Revellers passing on the stairs. JOE and STEPH walking down. A DRAG QUEEN walks past with a hard-hat perched on her wig and a sign around her neck; MARTHA SCARGILL. JOE snaps her picture. STEPH suddenly grabs JOE and ducks behind his back. ZOE and STELLA walk past. They give JOE rather a dirty look, handing him a flyer. Once they’ve gone STEPH re-emerges.
GAIL=>Talcum powder. GWEN
STEPH=>That’s cheery. GAIL
GAIL=>You’re joking.
SIAN=>What a shame.
MARION=>We’ve always been friends, haven’t we? You and me.
DAI=>Jesus Christ.
SIAN=>Three o clock.
MARTIN=>I did speak up.
JOE=>Who was that?
LEE=>What the hell’s this?
MARION=>And where have you been?
POLICEMAN=>Haven’t you heard about the miners, Dearie? They lost.
MARK=>With. This is a fucking demonstration.
ZOE=>Because that’s the way you get things done.
JOE=>Listen to me.
