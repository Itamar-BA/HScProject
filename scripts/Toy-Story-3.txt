VOICE=>Ai! Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-yah!
GALLOPING HOOVES=>TILT UP to find Woody, riding BULLSEYE, JESSIE at the reins.
WOODY=>Hold him steady...
WOODY=>Reach for the sky!
WOODY=>Well, I brought my dinosaur, who eats force-field dogs!
YOUNG ANDY=>Buzz! Shoot your laser at my badge!
ALIENS=>You saved our lives! We are eternally grateful!
ANDY=>Molly, stay outta my room!
HAMM=>Yeah, but now its here!
BUZZ=>Trash bags...?! WOODY
SOLDIER TWO=>You’re gonna need it...!
SLINKY=>And the old TV...! WOODY
WOODY=>And someday -- if we’re lucky -- Andy may have kids of his own...
ON THE DRESSER=>Woody climbs up, surveys the room -- posters, guitar, textbooks. He turns to a cork board where Andy’s high school graduation photo is pinned. He lifts it to find... A SNAPSHOT shows an eight-year-old Andy wearing a cowboy hat and posing with Woody and Buzz and all of Andy’s toys. Woody gazes at the halcyon past he can never return to. Buzz steps up behind him.
WOODY=>For Infinity and Beyond...
MOLLY=>Your video games?
ANDY=>Forget it, Molly!
THE TOY CHEST=>The Toys watch as Mom picks up a box, enters Molly’s room.
THE TOY CHEST=>Across the hall, the Toys react.
MOM=>Andy, come on -- you need to start making decisions. ANDY
THE TOYS=>Silently hear this bombshell. Mom lowers the lid.
IN THE BAG=>Buzz is stunned and hurt. Andy cinches the bag closed and carries it from the room. Behind him, Woody pops up from the College box, shocked.
IN THE BAG=>It’s dim and crowded.
ANDY=>You need a hand? MOLLY
IN THE BAG=>The Toys are piled all over each other. Jessie is hyper- ventilating. Buzz looks around -- plotting his next move.
ON THE LANDING=>The attic ladder -- spring loaded -- retracts, pushing the toy-filled trash bag out of the way.
IN THE BAG=>The bag is tipped over. The Toys tumble over each other.
ON THE LANDING=>The ladder pushes free and rises to the ceiling, retracting completely. Woody tiptoes into the hall toward the bag. Suddenly, Mom enters carrying a trash bag. Woody retreats. Mom trips over the toy-filled bag, looks down -- irritated.
ANDY’S ROOM=>Woody -- at the door -- is electrified.
IN THE BAG=>Mounting panic.
JESSIE=>We’re on the curb!
IN THE BAG=>The Toys follow Buzz’s lead, pulling the sides of the bag.
OUTSIDE THE BAG=>The truck RUMBLES closer, two driveways away.
IN THE BAG=>The Toys follow Buzz, shoving Rex backwards.
OUTSIDE THE BAG=>The bag stretches. Rex’s tail is nearly through. IN THE BAG
IN THE YARD=>Woody uses the scissors to snip his way out of the bush. The garbage truck approaches Andy’s driveway. Woody races out, dives behind the mail box post. The GARBAGE MAN is in head phones, playing air guitar, drumming the mail box. He empties a garbage can into the truck. Woody ducks from behind the post, plunges his scissors into a garbage bag. Garbage spills out: wrong bag. He tries another. No luck. As the Garbage Man turns, Woody ducks behind the post. The Garbage Man grabs the last bags, tosses them in the truck. He climbs on a running board, SLAPS the side. The truck shifts into gear and lurches off down the street.
THE STREET=>As the truck rumbles off, Woody ducks from behind the mail box, runs after it. The truck pulls up at the next house. Woody hides behind a fire hydrant. The Garbage Man hops off the runner, yanks a lever. The truck’s compactor lowers, scoops up the trash bags. From behind the hydrant, Woody watches in horror. The compactor retracts, CRUNCHING the bags remorselessly.
MR. POTATO HEAD=>Yeah! And Woody was wrong!
JESSIE=>Fellas -- I know what to do!
WOODY=>What the heck...?!
WOODY=>No...! No, no, no! He was putting you in the attic!
WOODY=>I know it looks bad but, guys, ya gotta believe me!
MR. POTATO HEAD=>Welcome to the club, Toots!
IN THE BOX=>Silence. The room is still. The Toys speak sotto.
BUZZ=>Careful! These toys might be jealous of new arrivals! REX
LOTSO=>Oh, look at y’all! You been through a lot today, haven’t you?
LOTSO=>Let’s show our new friends where they’ll be stayin’!
BUZZ=>What a nice bear! REX
CLOSET DOOR=>Lotso flings open a utility closet, revealing a spa-like workshop in which smaller Toys fix up bigger Toys -- stitching rips, etc. The Toys gasp, impressed.
IN THE CLASSROOM=>As the tour continues, Ken gestures to his Dream House.
LOTSO=>Uh, watch out for puddles...
JESSIE=>Look at this place! BUZZ
KEN=>Yessssssss...!!!
SLINKY=>Why don’t you stay?
HAMM=>Come on, Woodster!
WOODY=>Bullseye, no! I said stay! Look -- I don’t want you left alone in the attic, okay? Now, stay.
BONNIE’S MOM=>Bonnie...? There you are. C’mon, honey. Time to go home.
WOODY=>You’re my favorite deputy!
IN THE BACKPACK=>Woody is trapped.
BUZZ=>Places, everyone!
UNICORN=>My name’s Buttercup.
BOTH=>Shhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! WOODY
BONNIE=>It has a secret ingredient...
TRIXIE=>You’re doin’ great!
MR. PRICKLEPANTS=>Are you classically trained?
BUTTERCUP=>There IS NO WAY OUT!!!
BUZZ=>I don’t recall play time being quite that strenuous.
BUZZ=>Try the windows.
BUZZ=>Stop! Let me go!
TRIXIE=>You’re leaving?!
BUZZ=>But I can’t accept. We’re a family. We stay together.
MRS. POTATO HEAD=>This is so weird...! He’s packing up... Uh-oh. Oh, here comes Buster.
MRS. POTATO HEAD=>Okay, Andy’s in the hall. He’s looking in the attic. Wait, there’s Mom. Why is he so upset?
JESSIE=>He’s looking for us?!
REX=>So, Andy does want us! I knew it! I just knew it!!!
JESSIE=>Oh, thank heavens!
MRS. POTATO HEAD=>Just look at my pocketbook!
MR. POTATO HEAD=>Hey, what are you doing? Let go of me you drooling doofus!
KEN=>Barbie...! I told you to wait in the Dream House!
WOODY=>Right around the corner...?! It’s right around the corner!!!
MR. PRICKLEPANTS=>Chuckles... He’ll tell you!
CHUCKLES=>One day, we took a drive...
CHUCKLES=>Lotso wouldn’t give up. It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy’s.
CHUCKLES=>But by then, it was too late.
YOUNG CHUCKLES=>No, she only replaced yo--!
BUZZ=>Commander Lotso, Sir! All quiet! Nothing to report! LOTSO
LOTSO=>Y’all get ready -- you got a play- date with destiny!
LIFER=>...Locked every night, inside and out. Keys are left on a hook in the office.
KEN=>Tyrannosaurus... REX
KEN=>What’d you think you were gonna do? Waltz right outta here?
MR. POTATO HEAD=>And I would’a got away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling Toys!
KEN=>What do you want?
KEN=>Yeah, well, you should’a thought of that yesterday.
BARBIE=>Ken... Would you model a few outfits for me? Just a few?
BUZZ=>Help! Prison riot!
BARBIE=>Oooohh! Glitter tux!
BARBIE=>Where’s that manual?
HAMM=>“To reset your Buzz Lightyear, insert paper clip....”
REX=>It’s not my fault!
SLINKY=>How do we do that? HAMM
LIFER=>Good luck, Cowboy.
JESSIE=>We haven’t seen him!
ON THE PLAYGROUND=>The Toys shoot out the bottom of the slide, scamper off. They huddle behind the spring of an animal rocking swing.
WOODY=>Back up, back up!
SPANISH BUZZ=>¡Ven conmigo! ¡Te mostraré las maravillas de la galaxia, y juntos lucharemos contra el despiadado Zurg! He plucks a dandelion, offers it to her. At that moment, Woody pushes through the bushes -- safe. Jessie leaves Buzz, runs and gives Woody an impulsive hug.
SPANISH BUZZ=>Buzz Lightyear al rescate!
TOYS=>Whoa! Watch out! They collide with Woody. Woody windmills his arms at the edge of the chute. Jessie grabs him, pulls him to safety.
SLINKY=>I might be old, but I still got a spring in my step.
SLINKY=>Okay! Climb across!
KEN=>Don’t do this, Lotso...!
WOODY=>No -- she lost you! LOTSO
LOTSO=>Push ‘em in! All of ‘em! This is what happens when you dummies try to think!
WOODY=>Oh...! For crying out loud!
BUZZ=>Yes, I’m back! Where’ve I been?
BUZZ=>But... Where are we now?!
WOODY=>Don’t thank me yet.
SLINKY=>You’re darn tootin’!
IN THE COLLEGE BOX=>Woody quietly peeks out the hand holes. POV -- Woody can half-see Mom hug Andy.
ANDY=>You will be, Mom.
ON WOODY=>He turns and glances off, noticing something.
THE PHOTO=>Of young Andy, playing with Woody and the other Toys.
TRACK IN ON=>Woody. Mom and Andy’s words echo in his head. WOODY POV -- His GAZE SHIFTS from Andy-holding-Woody to Woody-with-the-other-Toys. Suddenly, Woody half-smiles -- an epiphany. Sadness and uncertainty are replaced by happiness and determination. FOOTSTEPS and collar JINGLES approach. Molly steps to the room’s threshold with Buster.
DONATE TO:=>Bonnie 1225 Sycamore Road
BONNIE=>Look out! The ghosts are throwing pies! Splat! Splat! Splat!
ANDY=>So you’re Bonnie?
BONNIE=>Oh, no! The ghosts are getting away! Woody’ll stop ‘em!!
WOODY=>So long, partner.
CRANE UP TO=>...Blue sky, and fluffy clouds.
