DEB=>Keep going.
BOBBY=>You feel lucky?
BOBBY=>I like you too.
BOY=>Not my fault.
EARL=>Yeah?... When?... How much did they get?... What was our money doing in a bank in New Mexico?... I’ll be on the next transport.
DR. KEN=>You’re not a cop.
STIG=>Did I kill him?
BOBBY=>What’s option 2?

ELECTRONIC VOICE ON PHONE=>If you are happy with your message, press one. If you would like to erase your message and start over, press two.
DEB=>What can I do?
EARL=>Look at me, not at him.
EARL=>And the money?

BOBBY=>Gimme your keys.
BOBBY=>Get in the car.
BOBBY=>What about Stig?
STIG=>Did you two...
STIG=>Sure, you did.

STIG=>What? Bobby?
EARL=>Get in the car.
RUDY=>Grab some men, head for the airfield.
EARL=>Is that right?

BOBBY=>You won’t miss.
BOBBY=>Hurts, don’t it?
