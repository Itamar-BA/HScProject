ANDREW=>Alright, fine...
ANDREW=>...mini bananas!
WILL=>Feeding the panda. This man gave me some bamboo.
ANDREW=>Sure. Of course.
ALARMED.=>Andrew stows the hose and heads for the zoo exit. The animals watch as Andrew exits the gate, locking it behind him. As soon as he disappears from sight, the Lion, obviously distressed, steps to the front of his habitat, turns to the other animals, opens his mouth, and... SPEAKS.
LION=>Greetings, everyone. I think you all know why we are here.
ELEPHANT=>We can not afford to lose Andrew. We must find a mate for him.
PIGEON=>‘Cause you’re scared. Not me. I’m free. Free as a bird. ...and this bird you can not chaaa- ange. Whoa-whoa-whoa...!
WILL=>Not so good. But... I hate eating meat at a zoo. KATE
LION=>Here he comes.
WILL=>There they are.
PEACOCK=>We need you, baby!
ANDREW=>How do I do that? PEACOCK
GORILLA=>Hold on, everybody. Let me just ask him something. This girl you like... have you thrown poop at her yet? No? Then what are we even talking about. This is basic stuff, people. Basic!
GORILLA=>Or, if you prefer, you could just throw poop at her.
WOLF=>Alright, stop.
ELEPHANT=>Trunk it up a bit.
ANDREW=>So what do I do?
ANDREW=>I’m not sure I...
KATE=>Honey, I’m working. I can’t watch you all day.
GORILLA=>Did you hear that?
SAMMY THE PANDA=>You so pretty. You mind if Sammy give you little bear hug?
TRENT=>Is Will okay?
KATE=>He’s a little nervous about starting camp.
TRENT=>Leave it to me.
CYRUS=>That’s my uncle.
LION=>Impressive aim. ZEBRA
LION=>Unfortunately, it’s starting to smell that way.
ANDREW=>But I thought you said Kate was totally into me.
ANDREW=>My mating ritual? PEACOCK
DEEP VOICE OVER SPEAKERS=>Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this seal show to bring you a special presentation...
ANDREW=>Your teddy bear.
ANDREW=>Baby let me be... Around you every night,
ANDREW=>Hey! Cut it out!
LION=>As King of the Zoo, I am commanding you to stay!!!
TRENT=>Nice try, guys.
KATE=>I’m afraid I’m a bit of a handicap for Will here.
KATE=>Is that Andrew?
ANDREW=>What do you mean?
ANDREW=>Oh... I... um...
ANDREW=>Thou art lovely with your long neck and tiny... ears. GIRAFFE
KATE=>Andrew, is this your way of trying to ask me out?
ZOO WORKER=>Dr. Quinlin, come quick. The Pandas are fighting!
WILL=>Who’s Orville?
ANDREW=>No. It’s okay. I’ll work something out.
BEGIN MUSIC CUE:=>EXT. PENGUIN HABITAT - EVENING The habitat is full of animals with buckets and cups bailing the water out of the penguin’s pool. The family of elephants are dipping their trunks in, filling up, then blowing the water out - everyone except Orville, that is.
ELEPHANT=>This water is vile.
END MUSIC CUE.=>INT. BALLROOM - EVENING The fund raiser is in full swing. A beautiful, crowded ballroom. People dressed in their finest. A band playing. Kate stands near the bar, alone. Trent approaches.
ANDREW=>This is for you.
KATE=>I’m afraid so.
ANDREW=>He’s a good kid.
KATE=>How right away? TRENT
ANDREW=>What’s going on?
ANDREW=>Enough! Enough!!
TRENT=>Where’s Andrew? KATE
ANDREW=>It’s okay, Will.
FATHER DOVE=>I love you too, Grace.
BOY=>Look, parade!!
TRENT=>How’s Ling Ling?
BOAT’S PILOT=>What the hell are you?
KATE=>What was that?
ANDREW=>Everybody, back!
