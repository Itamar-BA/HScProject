SHAWN=>We’re gonna get the parents now. You all set, ace?
BILLY=>What the fuck!
JIMMY=>Eight hundred.
JIMMY=>Okay. Right...
KITCHEN=>where his wife SARAH, late 20s, an understated beauty, eight months pregnant now, sets dinner out on the kitchen table, still dressed in her waitress uniform from an earlier shift.
SARAH=>And I saw one on sale at Sears for $600 dollars. MIKE
PAT=>You’re not fine. You’re drunk is whatcha are. Santa’ll be right back, guys.
JIMMY=>Maureen Galvin. SHAWN
MAN’S VOICE=>Look what the cat dragged in.
CURTIS=>This your limo?
MIKE=>That’s right.
CURTIS=>I aint scared. MIKE
COLIN=>
COLIN=>Open the door.
COLIN=>AHHH! YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
AHH! FUCK!=>Mike’s on his feet — Colin RUNS in from the family room — raises his pistol and FIRES — BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! — each shot narrowly missing — MIKE who is OUT THE BACK DOOR — TEARING across the snowy BACKYARD — VAULTS A CHAIN-LINK FENCE — into another backyard where a VICIOUS DOBERMAN boasts its fangs and CHASES —
COLIN=>Jesus Christ...
KITCHEN=>where Sarah, Catelyn and Lily are at the table decorating Christmas cookies. Sarah looks up.
MIKE=>You. The girls —
MIKE=>Look at me... Everything’s gonna be okay. Take the girls to your brother’s house.
SARAH=>We’ll see, sweetheart.
DALEY=>Whalen, Edney.
BOOM-BOOM-BOOM.=>Mike stands, slips a butcher knife from a knife block. Moves charily across the LIVING ROOM to the door. Through the peephole he sees JIMMY standing there in his parka.
JIMMY=>Can I come in? MIKE
JIMMY=>I got a call from Shawn. You talk to the police yet?
SHAWN=>That’s right.
MIKE=>Who were they? JIMMY
KENAN=>No, it’s just — your dad told us not to go nowhere. COLIN
MIKE=>shuts off the faucet and reaches for a towel. Dries his face, then looks at his reflection in the window. He’s shocked by the sight of COLIN, just feet behind him. He turns back — Colin RAISES the 9MM at him — Mike shuts his eyes, bracing for what’s next and —
BLAM! BLACK.=>For an uncomfortably long time. Finally: MIKE OPENS HIS EYES. Still alive. Colin has his hand on his neck, face twisted into a question mark, as if he’s been stung by a bee he never saw circling. Suddenly, a RIVER OF BLOOD seeps through Colin’s fingers and runs down his shirt. He’s been shot in the neck. REVEAL JIMMY NOW... standing at the end of the hall... the SW1911 in hand... unlit cigarette dangling from his lips... Kenan looks down at his pistol... knowing he’ll be dead before he raises it. He makes the smart move and RUNS for the back door... exits the home... Colin FALLS to his knees... then TOPPLES to the floor... and dies... blood fanning out beneath him... Jimmy steps into the kitchen now. Stares down at a Colin a moment. Slides out a chair and sits at the table.
JIMMY=>Yeah it’s me.
SHAWN=>Sshh... sshh...
WHALEN=>Michael Conlon? Officers Whalen and Edney.
MIKE=>Excuse me...?
JIMMY=>Jesus Christ...
WHALEN=>157 at 2620 East Somerset. That RA Unit en route?
MIKE=>HELP! HELP!
BANG!=>The BUICK HITS THE CRUISER! The Cruiser SHUDDERS — its side SCRAPES UP against the median barrier — SPARKS FLY —
EDNEY=>What the hell!
BANG!=>More SHUDDERING! More SPARKS! Edney fights to straighten the Cruiser.
ON MIKE=>SLOW-MOTION NOW as the CRUISER GOES AIRBORNE — FLIPPING OVER — the cars, the city lights, the night sky — all of it UPSIDE DOWN. REAL TIME RESUMES AS — THOOMP!— it LANDS ON ITS ROOF — EXT. VINE STREET EXPRESSWAY — NIGHT and SKIDS ACROSS EASTBOUND TRAFFIC before finally coming to rest against the barrier wall. All TRAFFIC HALTS. DRIVERS climb out of the cars to gape at the horrible wreckage.
JIMMY=>bursts out of the Buick, .45 in hand as he hops over the median. A TRIO OF GOOD SAMARITANS near the cruiser to look for survivors. Jimmy FIRES the pistol into the air:
FRANK AND BRENDAN=>enter the station now and look around. Nothing. They spread out.
CONCOURSE=>Jimmy and Mike moving through a CRUSH OF PEDESTRIANS, feeling the urgency and picking up the pace.
FRANK=>stalks through that same concourse. SEES JIMMY UP AHEAD stepping onto a DOWN ESCALATOR. He RUNS now, KNOCKING people out of the way — holiday shopping bags hitting the floor as he PUSHES HIS WAY ONTO THE ESCALATOR and —
MIKE=>turns back, SEES Frank nearing.
MIKE=>steps off the escalator and turns back. SEES Jimmy in a struggle, being pummeled by Frank. He decides to leave him.
JIMMY=>deflecting blows — manages to FLEE FRANK’S GRASP. He STUMBLES off the escalator and RUNS INTO the —
BATHROOM=>tries to lock the door when — BA-WOOMP! the DOOR FLIES BACKWARD as FRANK comes barreling in, KNOCKING Jimmy to the floor. Frank locks the door and stares down at Jimmy, a shit-eating grin curling on his face:
FRANK=>I’ve been waitin’ a long time for this, Conlon.
FRANK=>Is that right? JIMMY
BRENDAN=>moving through the throng. SEES Jimmy’s brown parka up ahead. SLIPS a pistol out.
THE SUBWAY=>Brakes HISS as it arrives at the platform.
BRENDAN=>grabs the brown parka and SPINS the man around. JABS the pistol into his gun and... BRENDAN
JIMMY=>head low, slips onto the SUBWAY CAR. The DOORS CLOSE. He watches Brendan frantically looking around as the train leaves the station and disappears into a tunnel. He EXHALES, falls into a seat... EXT. INTERSTATE 676, VINE STREET EXPRESSWAY — NIGHT The scene of the accident. A circus. Flares, police tape, traffic backed up for miles. HORNS from impatient drivers. For HARDING it’s just another night on the job as he crouches down beside the cruiser. Gets a look at Edney inside, then turns to Whalen’s lifeless body ten yards down the road. FLORES appears behind him. FLORES
FLORES=>
FLORES=>Michael Conlon.
HARDING=>If we didn’t, we do now. What’re you two doin’ here? NANCE
JIMMY=>That’s right. MIKE
KENAN=>I’m so sorry, Mr. Maguire — I’m so fuckin’ sorry.
SHAWN=>Make the call.
PRICE=>Love you, too.
EDDIE=>Oh for Christ’s sake.
EDDIE=>Good, yeah...
JIMMY=>We got jumped. EDDIE
REPORTER ON TV=>— That’s right, Ken. Police are on the hunt tonight for two suspects identified as James Conlon and his son, Michael Conlon...
REPORTER ON TV=>...who they say took the lives of two veteran police officers during a deadly chase and shooting on the Vine Street Expressway.
EDDIE=>Jesus Christ...
EDDIE=>What’ve you gotten yourself into this time, Jimmy? It’s all over the news in there...
MIKE=>in the den, listening.
BATHROOM=>A tense face-off between the brothers finally dissolves. Jimmy sits back down and continues wrapping his arm.
ON HARDING=>At his desk, scanning the article behind reading glasses. Feeling weirdly nostalgic. The night dredging up memories.
A FEW DOORS DOWN=>Jimmy KNOCKS on another apartment.
HARDING=>Ten minutes later he’s handcuffed in a pileup on 676. I wanna know how the hell did he out there?
ERIC=>Who are you?
VARIOUS ANGLES/VARIOUS FLOORS=>OFFICERS STORM APARTMENTS... SCOUR BEDROOMS, CLOSETS, SHOWERS looking for Jimmy and Mike... BARKING at spooked and half- asleep RESIDENTS to evacuate the building...
INSIDE ONE APARTMENT BEDROOM=>COPS order a COUPLE out of bed, then flip the mattress, unknowingly KNOCKING OVER a candle on the night stand.
CLOSE ON: THE CANDLE=>As it IGNITES the rug... FLAMES LICK the mattress above... INT. PLAZA TOWER — BASEMENT — NIGHT Price shines a MAGLITE on an ELECTRICAL PANEL. Locates the MAIN CIRCUIT BREAKER, SWITCHES it off.
MARCUS=>I don’t know, man. Shit, my mom’s gonna kill me.
ERIC=>glances inside Jimmy’s coat and NOTICES the SW PISTOL tucked into his waist. His mind putting things together. A panic rises. He TAKES OFF into the —
HALLWAY=>and CALLS OUT to TWO OFFICERS at the far end —
JIMMY AND MIKE=>having heard ERIC’S PLEA — RACE OUT OF THE APARTMENT — into the HALL — towards the STAIRWELL as the OFFICERS chase —
STAIRWELL=>and SPRINT UP the stairs —
PRICE=>HEARS their footfalls two flights above. He BOUNDS up the stairs — glances to his left — SEES the TWO OFFICERS heading for the stairwell — waits for them to enter his trap and — BLAM! BLAM! TWO MUZZLE FLASHES IN THE DARK. Both Officers fall, shot in the head. Brutal. Efficient. Price continues up the stairs. EXT. PLAZA TOWER — NIGHT Harding and Flores among the cops and onlookers when — BOOM! — a WINDOW IN THE TOWER EXPLODES! Everyone DUCKS. Harding looks up. Black smoke billows from a 10th floor APARTMENT WINDOW where a fire rages. He RACES inside building. Flores follows. STAIRWELL — JIMMY AND MIKE As they reach the 15th floor landing. A door out to the roof. Chain-locked. Mike KICKS it. Jimmy joins in.
JIMMY=>Sonofabitch!
PRICE=>moving up the stairwell. Pushing against the current. He SPOTS JIMMY and MIKE one flight above — RAISES his pistols and FIRES — BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BURSTS OF ORANGE LIGHT IN THE DARK! RESIDENTS SCREAM! PANIC! EVERYONE HITTING THE GROUND as —
MIKE AND JIMMY=>spill out of the stairwell — into the 7TH FLOOR hall as — ANOTHER FLOOR — FIND HARDING Amid the mayhem of RESIDENTS FLEEING APARTMENTS and the DENSE SMOKE. Can’t see a foot in front of him. Grabbing every RESIDENT that brushes past, pulling him or her close to get a view of their face. Ahab desperate to find his whale. 7TH FLOOR — MIKE AND JIMMY SO MUCH SMOKE NOW as they try apartment doors. Locked. Locked. Locked. Then — Jimmy turns a knob: Open.
PRICE=>enters the hallway from the stairwell.
PRICE’S POV=>The hallway empty. Filling with smoke. He starts to move now. FIRING AT DOOR HANDLES — KICKING OPEN APARTMENT DOORS — scanning the interior before moving on to the next. INT. 7TH FLOOR APARTMENT Jimmy’s scouring the space for escape routes. Can’t find any.
PRICE=>KICKS OPEN the apartment door — SEES Jimmy on the balcony. RAISES HIS PISTOLS and FIRES —
JIMMY=>JUMPS and — WE JUMP WITH HIM — THROUGH THE SMOKE — LANDING HARD on the roof below and tumbling up to Mike. He clutches his ankle, grimaces. Mike lifts him to his feet as —
PRICE=>Stalks out to the balcony. Observes Jimmy and Mike RUNNING across the warehouse rooftop.
JIMMY=>feeling Price’s eyes on him, glances back at him through the veil of eddying smoke.
PRICE=>Returns the stare. Eyes on eyes. Killer versus killer. INT. HALLWAY — NIGHT — ON HARDING SO-MUCH SMOKE NOW and he covers his face with his shirt and his eyes are burning and he reaches the end of the hall and lifts open the window. Gulping in the fresh air when he notices TWO SILHOUETTES running across the rooftop below. He DARTS for the stairwell as — INT. WAREHOUSE — MIKE AND JIMMY Stumble across the abandoned warehouse floor. All naked pipes and hanging wires. Jimmy stumbles, FALLS.
MIKE=>We gotta move! JIMMY
MIKE=>You alright?
VARIOUS ANGLES NOW=>as the two cars RACE UP LEVEL AFTER LEVEL — BUMPING, SCRAPING and SMASHING into one another — the Oldsmobile FALLING APART piece by piece — bumper, side mirrors, hubcaps — INT. OLDSMOBILE ACHIEVA, MOVING — SAME Jimmy DUCKS as PRICE FIRES ANOTHER CLIP in his direction —
JIMMY=>tired of the demons — so fucking tired of them — fingers the trigger. All his pent-up rage surging forth. A moment away from sending Price into permanent dark when —
CLOSER, ON CURTIS=>caught up in the action when he feels a presence. Turns to Mike and Jimmy at his side. He recognizes Mike and panics. Tries to RUN. Jimmy grabs his backpack, reins him in.
JIMMY=>Settle down.
HARDING=>Yeah, I’m here. JIMMY
ON SHAWN=>sitting at the desk, gazing reflectively at the photos. His whole life on the walls before him. Pat KNOCKS on the door and steps inside.
CURTIS=>Your dad’s gone.
NURSE=>Can I help you? JIMMY
MARGARET=>Oh yes. Thank you.
JIMMY=>The circus?
JIMMY=>Dad was here?
JIMMY=>exits the rear door now. He has a clear shot of Shawn’s back, but won’t take it.
HARDING=>He did. He showed himself to be a very brave young man.
CURTIS=>Didja hear that? ANGELA
DETECTIVE=>Phone call for ya’.
JIMMY=>Shawn Maguire.
JIMMY=>Close with ‘em? HARDING
KITCHEN=>Sara sits at the kitchen table. Warming her hands around a mug of tea. Worried sick. Hasn’t slept all night. It’s a windy, cold morning outside and the wind buffets the home. Windows rattle in their frames. TIRES over gravel. Sarah rushes to the window and observes the Dodge Charger entering the drive. Mike steps out of the car. Her body slackens with relief. She could almost cry.
JIMMY’S POV=>The pictures. Catelyn’s birth, Lily’s first bath; birthdays, holidays, Halloween costumes, bike rides, etc... A lifetime of happy memories.
JIMMY=>His eyes well with tears.
JIMMY’S POV=>VERY TIGHT ON the faces of Sarah. Catelyn. Lily. Mike.
VERY TIGHT ON JIMMY=>It hits him all at once... everything he missed... everything he wasn’t... And it just breaks him... it just fucking shatters him into a million pieces... His stomach quakes.
JIMMY=>Oh God. Oh God. Tears roll down his face. We stay on Jimmy for a very long while, fighting like hell to hold it together... Until...
AT THE LAKE’S EDGE=>Mike HEARS the dull echo of gunshots. He looks upward to the cabin, but can’t see anything through the dense woods.
PRICE=>clicks another magazine into his FIVE-SEVEN PISTOL, then coolly starts down the wooded slope towards the lake to fulfill the second half of his charge. INT. CABIN — JIMMY clutching his bloody chest. He drags himself across the kitchen floor, leaving a streak of blood on the linoleum. Grunting through unbearable pain, he PICKS himself up, opens the closet door and removes a KIMBER CLASSIC HUNTING RIFLE.
BLAM!=>Kingfisher birds flee a tree. A CRIMSON ERUPTION FLASHES OFF PRICE’S SHOULDER.
PRICE=>FALTERS, leans against a prodigious pine and calmly appraises the gaping wound and exposed tendons and bone of his shoulder. Blood runs down his right arm which hangs limply at his side like a flaccid noodle. He can’t move it. Undaunted, he reaches over with his left hand and takes the pistol and trudges forward as —
MIKE=>begins to SCURRY UP THE STEEP SLOPE when he notices Price. Just ten yards away. He FREEZES.
PRICE=>raises his left arm, levels the pistol at Mike when —
BLAM! BLAM!=>TWO BULLETS RIP THROUGH PRICE’S CHEST. He PITCHES FORWARD and TUMBLES HEADLONG down the rock-ribbed slope, coming to rest finally on a slab of rock, dead. Mike scans for the source. HARDING APPEARS AT THE CREST OF THE SLOPE, pistol still trained on Price... waiting for any movement... Finally:
TIGHT ON JIMMY=>Very near death. Slumped against the frame of the back door. The rifle on the ground beside him. His breaths get quieter and quieter until they’re barely audible. His life doesn’t flash before his eyes. There’s no tunnel or white light. He just dies. A gust of wind tousles the dead man’s hair. The wind HOWLS. The screams of the dead.
ON MIKE=>Hard to tell what he’s thinking. His face a melange of emotions: relief, anger, regret, sadness, absence.
