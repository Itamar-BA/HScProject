WILLARD=>CAMERA PUSHES IN on WILLARD STILES, 30's. Under-lit by the trembling flashlight, still in his short sleeve white collar shirt and cheap tie work clothes. CAMERA CONTINUES...MOVING CLOSE on his puppy like eyes; locked on the mesh screen across the room. CAMERA CONTINUES until these eyes FILL THE FRAME; these eyes...afraid. INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE - NIGHT - CLOSE-2-

WILLARD=>Sighs, reaches out and holds the guide... WILLARD'S POV - d-CON GUIDE TO RODENT CONTROL His finger searches through questions on the far right. "What type of rodents do you have?" "Mice", "Rats". "Where will product be used?" "High traffic areas "Low Traffic Areas The finger pauses upon... "Do you want proof you caught the rodents?" *Yes, I want proof. *No, I do not want to see or come in contact with a dead mouse/rat."
WILLARD=>Perspiration beads on his forehead.
FRAME)=>Willard's trembling finger settles beneath... "No, I do not want to see or come in contact with a dead mouse/rat..." The finger moves across the guide to the recommended d-CON product which is "Mouse- Prufe II".
WILLARD=>Searches the shelves with his eyes. CLOSE - DUANE READE SHELVES CAMERA PASSES OVER several sickening options. A package of an electronic pest repeller illustrates spiders, moths and rats fleeing from concentric circles of ultra sound. The Giant Destroyer is powdered sodium nitrate; "The Effective Gas Killer! Kills Gophers, Moles, Woodchucks, Rats, Skunks & Ground Squirrels!" Zep Commerical offers "Pest Glue Traps"; squares of cardboard with dabs of adhesive. "Traps Crickets, Spiders, Scorpions, Cockroaches and Larger Pests!"
WILLARD=>Frustration increasing; rummaging the shelves. He holds... WILLARD'S POV - STORE SHELVES The store marker indicates the location of "Mouse Prufe II." The area, however, is empty. The store is sold out.
WIDE OVERHEAD ANGLE=>Bright fluorescent lights glare upon Willard standing before the pest control section; an aisle amongst several aisles. While he is motionless, other customers move amongst the aisles like lab rats in a maze... EXT. STREET - OLD BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - NIGHT Dead LEAVES blow across a cracked sidewalk. A pair of worn wing-tip shoes enter frame. CAMERA FOLLOWS the shoes adjusting to reveal Willard proceeding along the way. CAMERA FOLLOWS Willard, passing nineteenth century brownstone houses. Several are under renovation; caged by scaffolding. Others are for sale, marked by high-end realtor signs. CAMERA MOVES AHEAD OF WILLARD until pausing on a corroded bronze plaque marked "STILES". CAMERA PAUSES as Willard, carrying a Duane Reade bag, starts up the steps. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a three-story brownstone suggesting hints of a proud past, turned pathetically decrepit, dark, and sad. The first and second level windows are barred. High above, centered, sits a yellow stained glass Dormer window beneath a Mansard roof. INT. WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
EXTREMELY CLOSE=>Metal coils strain as a thick copper bow is pulled back.
A LOCKING BAR=>Is placed over the bow and engaged on the curved portion of the bait pedal, dabbed with peanut butter. SUDDENLY! the locking bar slips out of place. The bow releases! SMACK!
WILLARD=>Drops the rat trap, clutching the knuckle of his index finger. Faintly splattered with peanut butter, he sucks on his throbbing knuckle. Angry, he picks up the trap intending to heave it against the wall. His eyes however, flash upwards; considerate of not waking someone in the house, upstairs. Holding the trap, he takes a closer look. Pulling the bow, he feels the tension. Releasing it, he imagines the death blow. SNAP! He pulls back the bow; releasing it.
SNAP!=>Willard appears repulsed by the medieval device. And yet... He considers the power over another life which lies in his hands. He pulls back the bow; releases it. SNAP! As he continues, hypnotized by the rat trap, CAMERA PULLS AWAY, as if to leave Willard alone in the cellar. SNAP! Several successfully set rat traps encircle him. He pulls back the bow; releases it. SNAP! CAMERA NOW SHIFTS...PANNING. ACROSS THE CELLAR to the small hole in the wire mesh, leading beneath the house. Willard is not alone. AS CAMERA PUSHES IN, THROUGH THE DARKNESS and HOWLING WIND OUTSIDE,.. two quarter-sized opalescent circles reflect light in a manner unique to animal eyes. OS, SNAP! The flashlight spill creates the illusion of mean, furrowed brows. Whiskers extend six inches in each direction from the snout. CAMERA CREEPS towards an enormous greasy eighteen inch black Norwegian rat; watching Willard. This is BEN. SNAP!
WILLARD=>Holding in the hallway, dry and well mannered.
MRS. STILES=>I'm sorry I've been such a bad mother to you...
MRS. STILES=>Or maybe you'd've found a girlfriend if you'd had a more handsome name. Mark or Kyle. Clark.
A PARKING SPACE=>A mid-nineties Cadillac is parked in the power spot. A sign on the brick wall declares: RESERVED - MR. MARTIN INT.

CAMERA FOLLOWS the patch of yellowing plastic fluorescent lights leading along a hallway of

WILLARD'S POV - OFFICE DOOR CAMERA PUSHES IN... The name FRANK MARTIN growing larger. Willard's hand knocks. After a power pause...
WILLARD=>Ventures an arm length into the room, clutching the doorknob, while awaiting acknowledgement.
MR. MARTIN=>Keeps working, making Willard hang...
WILLARD=>Averts his eyes, then quietly attempts a retreat.
MR. MARTIN=>Eyes still on his work, gestures pointedly for Willard to take a seat in one of the leather chairs across his desk.
WIDER=>Willard moves like a condemned man trying to maintain a morsel of dignity. He sits. Martin maddeningly busies himself as a means of intimidation...
WILLARD=>I...I don't know her.
MR. MARTIN=>Your family name is still on this factory, Willard. Martin - Stiles - Iron Works. Your father built this company. If nothing
WILLARD=>My mother's been sick.
MR. MARTIN=>With a false sagacity.
WILLARD=>We can't afford that.
WIDER=>Martin rises and returns to his desk while making a suggestion; delivered as if it were an off the cuff idea.
MR. MARTIN=>Why not sell your house?
CATHRYN=>Averts her sympathetic eyes.
MR. MARTIN=>Is that business is a rat race and promise or no promise...
WILLARD=>Continues toward his desk, leaving Mr. Martin framed in his office doorway.
TRAPS=>Willard's hand removes a cellophane package holding four cardboard rectangles dabbed with industrial glue.
WILLARD=>Having stopped after his hard day at work and holding a package of new plug fuses, he studies the glue trap package. WILLARD'S POV - GLUE TRAP PACKAGE Disposable; just throw everything away! "Your hands never touch the pest or glue!" INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT Like a rat, CAMERA CREEPS EERILY ACROSS THE FLOOR, assembling several dozen 4X6 cardboard squares strategically placed throughout the basement. CAMERA CONTINUES toward a flashlight beam aimed in an open fuse-box. Willard screws a new plug fuse into the box. The overhead
IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM=>Nothing but cold cement. The shrieking continues...
WILLARD=>Eyes wincing at the horrific sound, yet desperate to find it a source, searches with the flashlight... Suddenly, movement. A small two weeks old white rat with red eyes is caught in the glue trap. However, only the hind legs are stuck and immobilized. The front legs remain free. Desperately scuttling across the floor like an amputee panhandler gone mad on his wheeled cart. WILLARD
SHRIEKS. IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM=>The light pans up to the hole in the wire mesh. An older, larger white rat, surrounded by a half-dozen young rats looks directly at Willard.
WILLARD=>Senses this is the mother of the trapped rat. The mother rat expresses a submissive posture to Willard; ears back and head down, eyes toward him... Willard instinctively senses the mother's plea for mercy.
WIDER=>While the young rat REEK! REEK! REEKS!, darting in and out of FRAME on the floor, Willard returns to the shelf holding rusted garden tools. HE sets down the hand cultivator, quickly places a pair of work gloves on his hands and turns toward the small white rat. CLOSE - YOUNG WHITE RAT Darts across the floor, trying to escape the light and the gargantuan figure chasing him.
WILLARD=>Holding the flaslight, in his favorite pajamas and bare feet, grabs the rat with his free, glove3d hand. INT. 2ND FLOOR BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE PACKAGE=>Highlighted in a blue rectangle "In case of accidental contact with adhesive, apply vegetable oil..."
THE YOUNG WHITE RAT=>Gooey vegetable oil pours over the rodent's hind legs, held in Willard's gloved hand. The rat squirms, but doesn't squeal.
WIDER=>Willard, still in his pajamas, is rattled and flustered. He sets down the jar of oil and attempts to pull the rat from the glue trap. The white rat softly squeals. INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Mrs. Stiles, supported by her walker and perspiring, leans her ear toward the door.
MRS. STILES=>What is that on your hand?
WILLARD=>Nearly smiles, holding the towel in his hands. He moves to the sink and quietly turns on the warm water. Grabbing a bar of soap, he cups some water and begins rinsing the white rat. It lets him.
WILLARD=>You seem pretty wise, except for getting caught in the trap.
WIDER=>CAMERA BEGINS INCHING BACK while holding the rat in his hand, Willard opens a drawer, rummages, and produces a plastic comb. As he begins gently grooming the rat's fur... INT.

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH... WILLARD=>Holding the young, white rat, moves to the opening in the wall and holds before the mother rat and her offspring. Willard raises the white rat and sets it before the mother.
WILLARD=>CAMERA INCHES ON TO HIM, unafraid and fascinated.
OPENING IN BASEMENT WALL=>After a series of squeaks from the mother, the family suddenly, hastily, hustles off with their peanuts.
WILLARD=>Is saddened by the sudden departure, and moves to the opening and shines the light inside but the family is gone. CAMERA RETREATS FROM WILLARD, as he once again feels nothing but loneliness in the dark, cold basement. He returns the peanut can to the storage shelf and starts towards the stairs. O.S., a soft squeak. Willard turns...
OPENING IN BASEMENT WALL=>Socrates. Alone. Looks at Willard.
WILLARD=>Eyes pathetically welling with tears. INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Socrates is asleep on the bed, curled up against the swell of Willard's back. Willard softly strokes the rat's fur and whispers, as if commenting on his earlier statement in the bathroom.
OVERHEAD ANGLE=>As if crawling along the ceiling, CAMERA PULLS AWAY across the silent room. Eerie, elongated shadows of the barred windows intertwine with bare tree branches outside, flickering upon the floor.
MR. MARTIN=>Stands angrily outside the elevator in the hallway. With a flick of his hand he latches the wire door closed, trapping Willard like a rat in a cage. Willard tries to open the door, but it's locked. He pathetically eyes Mr. Martin who glares sadistically.
WILLARD=>Weakened, he tugs at the door. It's locked and as CAMERA RECEDES into the empty hallway, he appears like a helpless animal in a cage.
WILLARD=>Submitting, averts his eyes.
OFFICE=>Mr. Martin exits. Ms. Leach eyes the door and waits a couple beats before turning off her desk lamp and grabbing her coat.
WILLARD=>Scratches the head of the large white rat.
WILLARD=>Sits on a box, head down, still in his work clothes. He holds a rolled up newspaper and absently taps it against his shin; not for any reason other than something to do while thinking.
SOCRATES=>Begins playfully tearing at the paper...
WILLARD=>Smiles, playing, and moves the paper out of reach.
SOCRATES=>Stands on its hind legs, clawing, trying to reach the paper.
WILLARD=>Lowers the paper to Socrates. With a playful tone.
SOCRATES=>Is joined by another. Both gnaw at the paper.
WILLARD=>Lifts the paper, holds...
THE TWO RATS=>Socrates SQUEAKS as if reiterating Willard's command. The rats tear at the roll of newsprint. A third rat joins the others. After a beat, Willard lifts the paper.
WILLARD=>Waits, holds, then...as if an idea occurs to him, he speaks in a tone of menace.
THE THREE RATS=>Learning quickly, begins tearing at the newspaper.
WILLARD=>Studies the rats, Socrates squeaking at the others. Then, as Willard considers: O.S., a thick, meaty tear. The sound is out of place amongst the rats. Willard pauses, listens. Again, a TEAR and HEAVY GNAWING. Willard slowly raises the flashlight and pans it in the direction of the sound.
IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM=>Across the dark basement revealing an old tire leaning against the wall. The light TILTS DOWN
BEN=>ALONG THE GROUND, CAMERA MOVES TOWARD BEN. Unaffected by the light, Willard's presence or the other rats.
WILLARD=>Absently nods as answering Ben's question. Socrates runs up Willard's shoulder.
BEN=>Tears a chunk of rubber from the tire, then coolly seems to look over its should to Willard, suggesting "Get the idea?".
WILLARD=>As if he's understanding...
BEN=>Away from the others, coolly watches his idea being implemented in the first stage.
WILLARD=>Snaps his fingers, in command.
TEAR IT UP!=>INT. BASEMENT - LATER Two worn carrying bags ENTER FRAME held at the handles by Willard dressed in different clothes than in the last scene. The bags, seemingly floating across the basement. In the b.g., seventy-five rats now live in the basement. Swarming on shelves, work benches and stairs.
WILLARD=>No, not Ben. BED. Only Socrates sleeps in bed.
MR. MARTIN=>And if you don't like it, quit! Be a man for once
WILLARD=>CAMERA ABOVE HIS EYE-LINE AND PUSHING IN. Willard smiles to himself at the irony of Mr. Martin's last comment. Willard looks to his Rolodex and begins turning the knob.
ROLODEX=>Names flip past until settling upon "Martin, Frank. Wife - Barbara. 263 Adams. Irvington, N.Y., 10533." As the card is yanked from the file... INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT With a tug, Willard opens the carrying bags, placed on their sides, his shadowy smile mischievous rather than sinister.
BEN=>Starts toward the bags. Willard's hand appears before him, halting him.
BEN=>Holds, appears angry O.S. Willard CLOSES THE BAGS with a snap, stands and crosses before Ben.
BASEMENT STAIRS=>Willard holds the bag handle in each hand, dressed for cold weather. Leather gloves, a worn long black overcoat and logo less baseball cap. He sets the bags on the landing, then reaches up to turn the doorknob. He opens the door; the kitchen, above, is dark. Willard turns back to retrieve the bags. Then, as he turns, back to exit the basement, the flashlight catches his mother! Willard is too startled, and nearly drops the bags. Under lit by the flashlight, she appears frightening.
WILLARD=>Perspires. The bags are heavy. As he walks, he looks up and down the street. UP THE STREET - WILLARD'S POV - MAILBOX It reads "THE MARTINS".
WILLARD=>Slows as he looks ahead. EXT. MARTIN'S GARAGE - NIGHT The automatic garage door is closing, allowing a glance of Mr. Martin and his wife, having just returned home.

WILLARD=>Takes a nervous breath and readies to approach the house. Suddenly, appearing behind him at his left blind side is a Brinks Neighborhood patrol car, ENTERING FRAME. The officer's attention is on Willard. The patrol car's RADIO is low. The officer is heard, but is indiscernible as he reports... Willard nervously picks up his pace. The patrol car remains in his blind side. Willard sneaks a peek up the street. WILLARD'S POV - MARTIN'S HOUSE Nears...
WILLARD=>Wants to check over his shoulder, but cannot. Suddenly, yellow siren lights flash over him. Willard tenses, freezes as CAMERA SWEEPS in on him. O.S., The patrol car engine REVS. The siren lights arc around Willard, from front to back. Willard looks up. WILLARD'S POV - PATROL CAR Races forward, passing him, as if moving off down the street. Willard eases...then the car

RATS=>CAMERA MOVES ACROSS THEM, incisors tearing at
CAMERA WILLARD=>Turns to the second bag. Upon opening it, however, he's shocked as...BEN sticks his head out. He is the only rat in the bag. Willard appears angry and somewhat afraid.
BEN=>Pushes his way through the opening in the base of the garage. Showing impressive strength, Ben "crashes" through.
WILLARD=>Notes Ben's strength. Willard then leans his head close to the garage door. Inside, he can hear FAINT GNAWING. INT. MR.

A BRINKS PATROL CAR=>A patrolman aims the light from inside the car. EXT. MR. MARTIN'S BACK YARD - NIGHT The beam of light spills into the side of the garage.
CONTINUOUS=>As Willard charges across the neighbor's yard, a dog barks. This is not booming Rommel-like bark. It's the YAP of a Maltese or Jack Russel. Lights turn on inside the house. The small YAPPING dog appears out of the darkness SNAPS at Willard's heels. Willard continues, searching for a path toward the front yard. He plows through some shrubs... EXT. MARTIN'S NEIGHBOR'S FRONT YARD -
CONTINUOUS=>Willard barrels through the bushes and hustles toward the sidewalk.
SIDEWALK=>Sweating and winded, Willard appears on the sidewalk, returning to a quick walk in order to avoid attracting any further attention. He checks behind for any signs of the Brinks patrol, however, they're not yet in sight. This street is QUIET. Willard eases, until --
THE YAPPING LITTLE DOG=>Charges out of the front yard and runs toward Willard.
WILLARD=>Picks up his pace. In a moment, the dog is at his heels barking and trying to get at the bags. Willard pushes the dog aside with his leg.
WIDER=>Willard resumes his walk up the pretty street. The bags begin knocking. He struggles to hold them. The dog's tough YAPPING has turned into muffled YELPS. WILLARD
MR. MARTIN'S PARKING SPOT=>Vacant.
WILLARD=>Smiles, pleased with himself as he strides toward the door. INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - MORNING The clock over the door indicates it is 9:20. Willard enters the bullpen with guarded anticipation. The employees are abuzz, gossiping, and rebellious; when the cat's away...
JANICE MANTIS=>Someone broke into Martin's garage last night, slashed his tires and peed on the floor.
GEORGE FOXX=>He pissed his pants, then blamed it on the guy who did it!
GEORGE FOXX=>Good morning, Mr. Martin. Is everything okay?
MR. MARTIN=>You think it's so fuckin' funny? How do you like the thought of some sick fuck breaking into your house?
WILLARD=>He works to suppress his euphoria over Martin's agitation.
WILLARD=>CAMERA HOLDS on Willard, pleased. In fact, at this point, having always SHOT WILLARD above eye level, now slowly, eerily, DROPS BELOW EYE LEVEL. It underlies his NEW SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AND POWER.
MR. MARTIN=>How'd you like it, Foxx?
WILLARD=>Smiles with a newfound confidence. The CAMERA DROPS INTO HIS COAT POCKET. Willard's hand inside, stroking Socrates. All Good Things... INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT A flat wood crate is empty. A bag of store bought, soy rat pellets are poured into the box.
WIDER=>Willard looks over the numbers and sighs.

SOCRATES=>Squeaks, as if pleading with Ben to get off.
BEN=>Remains. He's staying.
BEN=>Doesn't care. Remains still. Challenging.

BEN=>Holds atop a cupboard staring down at Willard.
WILLARD=>Looks up, increasingly impatient with Ben.
BEN=>Appears to consider. He lifts his head, then moves off into the shadows.

WIDER=>Willard signs paperwork on a clipboard and returns it to a deputy medical examiner who absently tosses the clipboard atop the body bag. With a startling CLACK, the gurney is raised and wheeled out of the house. Willard slowly shuts the door. The house is quiet and lonely. Emotionally numb, Willard wanders to the stairs and must sit. The stretched shadows of the barred windows reach Willard, causing him to appear like a prisoner or a caged rat. After a beat, Socrates crawls into Willard's lap. The white rat nuzzles against Willard, comforting him.
MRS. STILES=>Socrates brushes his nose against her dead face.
WILLARD=>Holding the rat to his mother, is about to cry again. WIDER - CASKET Willard's back is to us. From this angle, Socrates can't be seen. Cathryn steps INTO FRAME, her back also to CAMERA.

MR. MARTIN=>Shouldn't you be working?
MR. MARTIN=>What now? Gonna sell the house?
WILLARD=>Moves to the window for a better look. Although distorted and oblique through the stained glass, Mr. Garter's posture conveys he is reporting to Mr. Martin. Garter gestures with a thumb toward Willard in the funeral parlor. Mr. Martin nods, pleased. The two men shake hands.
WILLARD=>As he watches out the window, Socrates held to his cheek. Cat, Food INT. FOYER - WILLARD'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON Rats are everywhere. The opening door shoots several across the floor.

WILLARD=>Tears open the sealed envelope holding his father's personal affects. A ring, wallet. Holding a leather billfold with reverence, his eyes well with tears looking at the driver's license, a photo of Mrs. Stiles and a photo of Willard. Hesitating, he removes a Swiss Army knife from the package and opens the blade. Along the edge is a line of brown stained blood. Willard untucks his shirt and rubs the blade. The blood is gone.

WILLARD'S HANDS=>Drop the knife. Socrates looks at him, as if relieved.
WILLARD=>Raises Socrates to his cheek, closes his eyes and feels the returned affection. O.S., a rustle. Willard opens his eyes. Tense, they scan the room.
BOOKSHELF=>Holding a bric-a-brac and mementos...and BEN'S TAIL. The CAMERA MOVES ALONG BEN'S BODY, his head blocked behind a framed photograph of Willard's father, as if Mr. Stiles' face is eerily part of Ben's body.
WILLARD=>The image and Ben's presence disturbs him. He turns and begins moving out of the dark office. About to exit, Willard pauses. Looking to an umbrella stand holding several antique umbrellas and swagger sticks. As he reaches out, raises one of the wooden swagger sticks for examination, then subtly looks back at Ben. Ben Won't Learn INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - LATER The sheets are pulled back. Willard climbs in with the swagger stick. The bedroom door's closed. While Socrates settles beside him, Willard checks the floor before proceeding to hide the stick beneath the pillows beside him. Once secured, he CLICKS off the light. The room turns dark, CAMERA CREEPS IN ON WILLARD. Listening... In the B.G., the door opens, intruder unseen. Willard's eyes check the door. He remains still. Listening. Then, faintly, against the hardwood floor, CLICK CLICK CLICK of nails and the sliding of an approaching tail. Willard stealthily reaches beneath the pillows and grabs the swagger stick's silver tip. The sheets tug toward the foot of the bed.
FOOT OF THE BED=>Against the windows, allowing faint street light inside... Ben's large silhouette appears over the foot of the bed.
SOCRATES=>Turns toward the foot of the bed and squeals, as if signalling to warn Ben.
BEN=>Backs up, tenses.
WILLARD=>Strikes. He whips the stick toward the foot of the bed.
BEN=>WHACK! Forewarned, Ben is too fast and jumps off the bed as the wooden stick WHISKS with a startling THUMP upon the bed.
WILLARD=>Hustles out of bed and chases Ben, retreating into the closet. Willard opens the door and turns on the closet light. WILLARD'S POV - CLOSET A hole has been gnawed in the baseboard.
WILLARD=>Subtle, yet increasing dementia, he looks to...
SOCRATES=>Looking to Willard, as if disappointed.
WILLARD=>Averts his eyes, guilty.
WIDER=>In his pj's, Willard sits in the closet grabbing loose change from a shoebox and stuffs it into the sock. Socrates sits on a shelf just over Willard's shoulder.
HOLE IN THE BASEBOARD=>Willard balls the coin-filled sock and jams it into the hole.
WILLARD=>Perspiring, obsessive, and straining to cut the can.
HOLE IN THE BASEBOARD=>BANG! BANG! BANG! A hammer flattens the curved metal. Willard places it over the sock stuffed hole and begins hammering nails into the old paint can.
WILLARD=>Rips a foot long piece of gray duct tape from a roll.
HOLE IN BASEBOARD=>The strip is laid over several layers of duct tape which has been placed over the flattened paint can, covering the coin stuffed sock placed in the hole.
WILLARD=>Leans back against the closet wall, exhausted and perspiring, yet satisfied that Ben's passageway is securely sealed. He picks up Socrates and scratches his head. INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - MORNING Willard's crashed, face down, as if having collapsed from emotional and physical exhaustion. The door is closed. The closet is closed. Socrates lies tucked beside him.
BEN=>Sits at the foot of the bed, watching Willard. CLOSE - WILLARD Stirs, awakens, lazily opens one eye. He sees:
BEN=>Motionless, yet taunting.
WILLARD=>Waits a beat, then, slowly and carefully extends his arm and reaches beneath the pillow. Willard reacts, puzzled. He digs deeper beneath the pillows, but apparently can't find the swagger stick. His eyes move toward the right side of the bed. Willard reacts, afraid...
WIDER=>Just above the bed is the swagger stick. Chewed to slivers. Recognizable only by the metal tips. Willard looks to:
BEN=>Stoic and yet an air of satisfied retaliation.
WILLARD=>Climbs out of bed. Unable to keep the peace, Socrates squeaks, head moving back and forth from Willard to Ben. Willard moves to the closet and looks inside. INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS The tape and metal securing the hole is untouched.
WILLARD=>A cold shiver shoots through him. He looks back toward Ben, who's GONE.
WILLARD=>Considers his next move... Position Terminated INT. FOYER - MORNING ACCORDION BRIEFCASE It's open.
BEN=>Inside the briefcase.
OFFICE=>Willard is intensely confused, as if the contents are inconceivable. Let alone incomprehensible. He looks to Cathryn, desk buttressed against his. She reacts to his bewilderment. Unable to speak and certain there is some mistake, he hands the letter to her. She reads it and although immediately angered, remains composed...
CATHRYN=>Mr. Stiles, it is our regret to inform you your position has been terminated. Enclosed please find two weeks severance.
OFFICE=>Willard storms across the room. Cathryn moves after him, wishing to restrain and regain his
CONTINUOUS=>The door is closed. Willard is inside being fired. INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Cathryn sighs and shakes her head.
MR. MARTIN=>Is dead. Been dead. Now, so's your mother. Movin' on...

MR. MARTIN=>Go 'head. Fuckin' sue me. You'll win. So go ahead. Hire a 250 dollar an hour lawyer and fuckin' sue me!
MR. MARTIN=>Wanna sue me? Need money? Make me an offer on your house.
HAND.=>INT. MR. MARTIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Mr. Martin sighs, rubs his chin and studies Willard.
MR. MARTIN=>Taps his desk, sighs and looks to Willard. Martin absently nods his head, about to agree to the terms. Before he can verbally respond, however...
MR. MARTIN=>Quickly gets up from his desk and hustles across the office.
WILLARD=>Flinches upon impact. Even the other employees wince.
MR. MARTIN=>Stabs the stick INTO CAMERA.
SOCRATES=>SCREAMS! The stick pulls away revealing red blood...
WILLARD=>Trembles, turns pale.
MR. MARTIN=>With a glint of blood lust, smiling. Spikes the stick INTO CAMERA.
SOCRATES=>Seriously injured and covered with blood. The rat searches for an escape. The stick drives
INTO FRAME. WILLARD=>Clutches the door-frame. His hazed eyes freeze beyond Martin and Socrates. WILLARD'S POV - BEN On the highest shelf, safely covered in the dark. His opalescent eyes glare angrily at Willard.
WILLARD=>Opens his mouth, as if to answer to Ben...until O.S., a piercing SCREAM. The other employees turn away, the excitement turning to overkill.
MR. MARTIN=>Getting the final bead.
SOCRATES=>WHACK! The stick drives INTO FRAME and finally crushes Socrates' skull. His white fur now completely red, the rat's body falls limp upon the metal shelf; lifeless.
WILLARD=>Cannot hold back the tears. In the excitement of the moment and the focus is on Mr. Martin, the others are oblivious to Willard's emotions. The employees APPLAUD and CHEER as Martin exits the room. He hands the stick to Ms. Leach.
MR. MARTIN=>Barbara, finders keepers!
WILLARD=>Shattered and trembling, looks up begging himself for forgiveness, but directed at Ben.
WILLARD=>Guilty, unable to receive penance from Ben, moves toward Socrates' body and begins crying. His tone, increasingly insane, suggests the triggering stress of Socrates' death.
BEN=>Staring at Willard, release an eerie guttural growl.
OVER WILLARD'S SHOULDER=>CAMERA PUSHES UP INTO HIM as he turns, looking back over his shoulder and up to Ben.
BEN=>CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE INTO BEN, staring down...as if committing to the pact. EXT. CARGO/DELIVERY AREA - FACTORY - AFTERNOON The factory cargo delivery area appears busy. From the depths of the foundry, Willard appears carrying his accordion briefcase and wearing a winter coat and leather gloves. A familiar face, he draws no attention. Without hesitation, he moves to a "Martin- Stiles Manufacturing" delivery van. The size of a UPS TRUCK, Willard climbs in and drives off. INT.

PARLOR MANTLE - LATER The urn holding the ashes of Willard's father rests on the mantle. Willard's hand ENTERS FRAME and lifts the lid.

WILLARD=>Last batch. Can't take anymore. The rest of you wait here.

COMPUTER MONITOR=>Images of a nude woman changing her gym clothes before a locker begins loading on the screen. CLOSE UP - MR. MARTIN Smiles. He reaches O.S., and brings the paper cup of Glenlevit to his mouth. He sips, then sets the cup down. As he reaches for the mouse...
A RAT=>Is on his desk. Martin's hand sets upon it. The rat HISSES!
MR. MARTIN=>Leaps back!
MR. MARTIN=>Shocked; confused. He pauses, holding his breath to listen, and hears a COLLECTIVE SCRATCHING AND SCUTTLING. He reaches out to his desk lamp and pans the light across the room. MR. MARTIN'S POV - OFFICE The floor moves in rolling waves; entirely covered by rats.
