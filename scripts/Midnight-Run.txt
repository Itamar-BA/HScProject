WALSH=>What the hell are you doin', Dorfler?
DORFLER=>He's mine, Jack. Get lost.
WALSH=>Fuck you, he's yours. He's mine. Moscone assigned this guy to me.
DORFLER=>Well, go straighten it out with Moscone. I'll collect the money.
WALSH=>Goddamn you, Dorfler. I nearly got killed tryin' to get him!
DORFLER=>Back off, Walsh. I said I'm takin' him.
WALSH=>Marvin. Why are we fightin'? You and me are friends.
DORFLER=>This clown's worth fifteen hundred, Jack. It's nothin' personal. Now get lost.
WALSH=>Alright, alright.
WALSH=>Marvin! Watch out!
BOUCHET=>What the fuck's goin' on? You guys ain't cops.
WALSH=>No, we're musicians. Get in the car.
WALSH=>Open your door.
WALSH=>We get out here.
BOUCHET=>All I did was come home and he was sleepin' with my old lady. And I shot him. Then I heard on the TV that the dude was "lucid." I didn't do that to him. I swear.
WALSH=>"Lucid" means he was coherent. Makin' sense when he talked.
BOUCHET=>Shit. He wasn't "lucid" before I shot him.
WALSH=>Hey, Gooch, I've got a delivery. Monroe Bouchet.
GOOCH=>Give you any trouble?
WALSH=>Nah, he was real cooperative. A regular charm.
WALSH=>Take care of yourself, Monroe.
BOUCHET=>You too.
WALSH=>Is Moscone in? I just dropped off Bouchet.
JERRY=>You finally caught somebody, Jack?
WALSH=>Jerry, is he in?
JERRY=>It says here that eleven percent of people, in the course of dreaming, are aware of that fact while they're in the dream state.
WALSH=>Where is he, Jerry?
JERRY=>That ever happen to you, Jack?
MOSCONE=>Hey, Jerry, this ain't a library.
MOSCONE=>Bouchet was twelve hundred, right?
WALSH=>No, fifteen.
MOSCONE=>Oh, yeah, right. I was just going over to Denny's to catch the "grand slam breakfast." They start serving at six-thirty.
WALSH=>Do you have my fifteen hundred?
MOSCONE=>Of course. Did you think I was gonna stiff you?
WALSH=>You? Never.
MOSCONE=>Jack, you really are the best at what you do. Let me buy you some breakfast.
WALSH=>I don't eat breakfast.
MOSCONE=>Then have an early lunch. Hey, Jerry. Watch the phones.
WALSH=>You'll never guess who I ran into while I was taking in Mr. Bouchet.
MOSCONE=>Who's that?
WALSH=>Marvin Dorfler.
MOSCONE=>No. Funny how that guy keeps poppin' up.
WALSH=>Hysterical.
MOSCONE=>Jack, I'm not gonna bullshit you. I got a little problem right now.
WALSH=>Hey, can we stop and buy a copy of Playboy, because when I'm being jerked off, I like to look at something.
MOSCONE=>What are you talkin' about?
WALSH=>I've been through this. You're about to tell me you don't have my fifteen hundred.
MOSCONE=>Jack, I've got something better than fifteen hundred.
MOSCONE=>Do you know who Jonathan Mardukas is?
WALSH=>The Duke? Yeah, I know who he is.
MOSCONE=>What do you know?
WALSH=>He's that accountant that embezzled a couple million from some Vegas wise guy and gave it to charity.
MOSCONE=>That's pretty good, only it wasn't a "couple of million," it was fifteen million and it wasn't just "some Vegas wise guy," it was Jimmy Serrano.
WALSH=>Yeah, I can read a newspaper.
MOSCONE=>Well, I don't want to bring up the past, but isn't Serrano the guy that ran you out of Chicago when he was running things there years back?
WALSH=>He didn't run me out.
MOSCONE=>Sure. You left being a cop to do this shit.
WALSH=>What's the point?
MOSCONE=>The point, Jack, is twenty-five thousand bucks. I bailed the accountant out. Only, I didn't know who he was at the time. If I knew, I never would of put up the bond. I mean it would only be a matter of time before Serrano vanished him from the planet and I'm out my four hundred and fifty grand.
WALSH=>You're out four hundred and fifty grand on this guy?
MOSCONE=>No.
WALSH=>No?
MOSCONE=>No. Because I've got you. And you're gonna go find him and bring him back.
WALSH=>Right. How do you even know he's still alive?
MOSCONE=>Because he sends Jimmy Serrano postcards from everywhere, telling him what a great time he's having with his money.
WALSH=>How much time you have left?
MOSCONE=>Friday midnight I default and have to eat the four-fifty.
WALSH=>That's five days. Forget it. You go find him.
MOSCONE=>Jack, hear me out. I'll give you fifty thousand. I'm in jam city.
WALSH=>I've got to chase you down just to collect fifteen hundred. No dice.
MOSCONE=>Jack...
WALSH=>Jack, nothin'. What else have you got?
MOSCONE=>If you don't get this guy, I might be out of business. I can't absorb this kind of loss.
WALSH=>I'll do it for a hundred grand.
MOSCONE=>A hundred grand! Are you out of your mind? Jack, this is an easy gig. It's a midnight run, for Christ sakes.
MOSCONE=>C'mon Jack, sit down.
WALSH=>If you want me for a job this big, you pay me what's right. Maybe you haven't noticed but I'm tired of getting shot at.
MOSCONE=>This guy's an accountant! He's not going to shoot you. Just put a bag over his head, hit him with a rubber hose and stick him on an airplane.
WALSH=>I'll do it for a hundred grand and then I'm out of this business forever. And I want a contract. I want it in writing. A hundred grand, and I'll have the Duke here by Friday night.
WALSH=>Now, do you think I could have my fifteen hundred?
HAMMOND=>I was just saying to myself that this has been the worst day in memory. All I need is Jack Walsh to appear, and look what blows in.
WALSH=>Dave, look, I need a favor.
HAMMOND=>What do you need? A case of Jack Daniels?
WALSH=>The booking slip for a guy named Jonathan Mardukas.
HAMMOND=>I'll get you a copy.
WALSH=>No, Dave. I need to see the original.
HAMMOND=>Copies were good enough for the FBI.
WALSH=>They're looking for him, too?
HAMMOND=>The guy's wanted in seven states.
HAMMOND=>What did you find?
WALSH=>The number Mardukas called after he was arrested.
WALSH=>Two-one-two. Looks like I'm going to New York.
WALSH=>Excuse me.
MOSELY=>Are you Jack Walsh?
WALSH=>Do I know you?
WALSH=>Hey, get the fuck outta my way.
MOSELY=>Inspector Mosely, Federal Bureau of Investigation.
WALSH=>Did you know there's a ten-dollar fine for jaywalking in Los Angeles?
MOSELY=>Are you working on anything having to do with Jonathan Mardukas?
WALSH=>Who's that?
MOSELY=>The Duke.
WALSH=>Never heard of him.
MOSELY=>I think you have heard of him.
MOSELY=>Let me tell you something, asshole. I've been working six years trying to bring down Jimmy Serrano and Mardukas is my shot. I want to take him into Federal Court.
MOSELY=>So I don't want to see some third- rate rent-a-thug who couldn't cut it as a cop in Chicago bring him into L.A. for some bullshit local charge. Do I make myself understood?
WALSH=>Let me ask you somethin'. Those sunglasses. Are those government- issued or do all you guys go to the same store to get them?
MOSELY=>You can go now.
WALSH=>Have a nice day.
WALSH=>Do you think I could have my sunglasses back?
WALSH=>Mosely, FBI.
WALSH=>Just kidding.
WALSH=>Harold Longman, please. Harry. Jack Walsh. Did ya get me that address check on that phone number? I've got it. Thanks, Harry. Say hello to Julie for me.
DARUVO=>You Jack Walsh?
WALSH=>Who wants to know?
JOEY=>That's a yes.
DARUVO=>We'd really like to have a word with you.
WALSH=>What about?
JOEY=>It involves big cash and lots of prizes.
DARUVO=>I'll make it short and sweet. The people I work for are very interested in your visit here.
WALSH=>Oh yeah? Who are the people you work for?
DARUVO=>An old friend of yours from the Chicago days.
WALSH=>How are ya?
DARUVO=>You're here for the Duke. You think he's in New York. We think you're right.
JOEY=>Where'd you get that coat? Is that a London Fog?
WALSH=>What the hell are you talkin' about?
DARUVO=>Never mind him. The way I hear it, you didn't cooperate with my boss a few years back.
JOEY=>You smoke Camels? I smoke Kools.
DARUVO=>My boss would pay you a hell of a lot more for the Duke than that putz bail bondsman in L.A.
WALSH=>How much more?
DARUVO=>How about a one with six zeros?
WALSH=>Are you gonna propose?
JOEY=>Propose?
WALSH=>'Cause if you ain't, quit fuckin' starin' at me.
DARUVO=>Yeah, Joey. Back off, for Christ sakes.
EMPLOYEE=>Here are your keys, sir. Just exit through the glass doors. The parking lot is to your left.
DARUVO=>Ask for Tony Daruvo. That's me. They'll put you through to wherever I am Be good to yourself, this time.
JOEY=>I think he's onto us.
DARUVO=>Figured that out, did ya?
WALSH=>Mrs. Nelson?
MRS. NELSON=>Yes?
WALSH=>Alonzo Mosely, FBI. How are you this afternoon?
WALSH=>Let me get right to the point, if I may, Mrs. Nelson. An agent in our Los Angeles office discovered a detail that somehow was overlooked until now. It seems that when Jonathan Mardukas was arrested, you were the first person he called. Isn't that correct, Mrs. Nelson?
WALSH=>Are you there, Mrs. Nelson?
MRS. NELSON=>Yes.
WALSH=>Needless to say, this is a matter of great concern to us. If it wouldn't be too much trouble, I would like you to come down to 26 Federal Plaza tomorrow at nine o'clock and ask for Agent Mosely. Do you think you could do that, please?
MRS. NELSON=>I suppose so.
WALSH=>Thank you for your cooperation. Good afternoon, Mrs. Nelson.
MRS. NELSON=>Dana? Helen. The FBI just called. They want to speak to me about Jonathan.
THE DUKE=>Helen? What's going on?
MRS. NELSON=>Jonathan, the FBI just called. They know we spoke the night you were arrested.
THE DUKE=>Hang up the phone, Helen. Right now!
THE DUKE=>What is it, Heidi?
DANA=>What is it, John?
THE DUKE=>I don't know.
WALSH=>Alonzo Mosely, FBI! Get that fuckin' dog outta here!
WALSH=>Don't move! I'll drop you right through the fuckin' glass!
THE DUKE=>Do what he says. Get her out of here.
WALSH=>You're the Duke?
THE DUKE=>That's right.
DANA=>John. What do I do?
THE DUKE=>Don't do anything, sweetheart, I'll be alright.
WALSH=>Yeah. He'll be fine.
WALSH=>Nice watchdog.
THE DUKE=>For five hundred dollars she should have taken your head off.
THE DUKE=>Congratulations.
WALSH=>For what?
THE DUKE=>You just did what no one else could do. You found me.
WALSH=>You got that right.
THE DUKE=>You're taking me to the airport, aren't you?
THE DUKE=>You don't seem like an FBI agent to me.
WALSH=>Well, you don't seem much like a "Duke" to me either.
THE DUKE=>If you're an FBI agent, why don't you just take me to the FBI office?
WALSH=>If you don't be quiet, this is gonna be the worst trip of your fuckin' life.
THE DUKE=>You work for Jimmy Serrano, don't you?
WALSH=>No, I don't work for that piece of shit. Your bail bondsman hired me to bring you back to L.A.
THE DUKE=>I've got money, you know.
WALSH=>I'm sure you do.
THE DUKE=>I'll give you whatever you want.
WALSH=>Start by shuttin' up.
WALSH=>It is truly in your best interest for you to just fuckin' relax.
THE DUKE=>I'm relaxed. I'm totally relaxed.
WALSH=>I can't keep you cuffed on a commercial flight and I gotta check my gun in with the luggage. But, fuck with me once, and I'll break your neck.
THE DUKE=>I can't fly.
WALSH=>What?
THE DUKE=>You heard me. I can't fly.
WALSH=>You're gonna have to do better than that.
THE DUKE=>I don't have to do better than that because that's the truth. I can't fly. I suffer from aviophobia.
WALSH=>What does that mean?
THE DUKE=>It means I can't fly. I also suffer from acrophobia and claustrophobia.
WALSH=>When we get to L.A. you can tell the prison psychiatrist all about it. You fuck with me you'll suffer from fist-O-phobia.
WALSH=>Jerry, give me Moscone.
JERRY=>Hold on.
MOSCONE=>Jack...
WALSH=>I got him.
MOSCONE=>Got who?
WALSH=>The Duke. He's standing right here.
MOSCONE=>You got him? Already?
WALSH=>You wanna say hello?
WALSH=>Say hello to your bail bondsman, Eddie Moscone.
THE DUKE=>Hello.
WALSH=>There you go. Jonathan Mardukas in the flesh.
MOSCONE=>Where are you now?
WALSH=>I found him in New York. We're at J.F.K.
WALSH=>We're comin' in on Flight 97. American Airlines. We'll be there at eleven, your time.
MOSCONE=>I love you. Jack, goddamnit! I really do!
WALSH=>See you soon.
MOSCONE=>Walsh picked up the Duke.
JERRY=>No kidding. That's great, Eddie. Let's celebrate. Do you want some donuts?
MOSCONE=>Yeah. Run down to Winchell's and get a dozen. And get me a few of those apple fritters.
JERRY=>You got it, Eddie.
JERRY=>Hello. This is Jerry Geisler. Can you put me through to Tony Daruvo.
DARUVO=>Yeah.
JERRY=>Tony, this is Jerry Geisler. How are you?
DARUVO=>I'm eating dinner.
JERRY=>I'm sorry to bother you, but Walsh found the Duke and he's bringing him in on American Airlines, Flight 97. They'll be at L.A.X. at eleven o'clock. Don't forget me, huh?
PHIL=>Mr. Serrano?
PHIL=>Daruvo called. Your friends are going to be flying into L.A. at eleven o'clock.
TUTTLE=>How did Walsh find him so fast?
WALSH=>First class is nice. I could make a habit out of this. America. What a country? Huh?
STEWARDESS=>Good evening, gentlemen.
WALSH=>Good evening to you.
STEWARDESS=>Would you gentlemen like something to drink once we're in the air?
WALSH=>We'd like your best champagne.
WALSH=>I'm gonna have the steak. How about you, John?
THE DUKE=>I'm not hungry.
WALSH=>Well, then, get the lobster so I can get a little surf-and-turf action goin'.
WALSH=>Enjoy the ride.
THE DUKE=>I'm not going to make it.
THE DUKE=>I can't go through with this.
STEWARDESS=>Sir, you'll have to sit down. We're taxiing.
THE DUKE=>I will not sit down! This is MY LIFE!
WALSH=>Stewardess, relax. This man's my prisoner and I'm taking him back to Los Angeles.
THE DUKE=>I'm getting claustrophobic. I can't take it. I've got this recurring nightmare, where I feel as if I'm losing control. And this feels the same way.
WALSH=>You're right. You're not in control. I'm in control. Now sit down!
THE DUKE=>How long is this flight?
STEWARDESS=>We should be in Los Angeles in just over five hours.
THE DUKE=>Should? Should be in Los Angeles? That means you're not sure! If you were sure, you'd say we'd be in Los Angeles in just over five hours.
WALSH=>Alright. Enough. Now sit down!
THE DUKE=>I'm in a casket and they've buried me alive! I'm in a casket and they've buried me alive! I can't get out! I can't get out! I can't breathe!
THE DUKE=>You can't do it. You can't make me fly. I'll go back to Los Angeles with you, but you can't make me fly!
CAPTAIN=>Alright, everyone. Just calm down.
WALSH=>Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
CAPTAIN=>You can't take a prisoner aboard an airplane if he doesn't want to fly. You should know that.
WALSH=>I do. I'm sorry. I thought he was bluffing. Let's forget the whole thing.
CAPTAIN=>I suggest you find some other mode of transportation.
WALSH=>What the fuck are you smiling at?
THE DUKE=>I love to travel by train.
WALSH=>What do you think this is, the class trip?
THE DUKE=>Are you always this angry?
WALSH=>I'm in a great mood right now. You wait until I've been cooped up on this thing for awhile. You'll be running for that jail cell.
THE DUKE=>Are you still going to make your deadline, Jack?
WALSH=>With fourteen hours to spare.
MILES=>You are?
WALSH=>Jack Walsh.
MILES=>And?
WALSH=>Guest.
MILES=>This way, gentlemen.
THE DUKE=>You know, Jack, it really shows me that you're a quality human being for not forcing me to fly against my will.
MOSELY=>Inspector Mosely, FBI.
CAPTAIN=>Mosely? Are all you guys named Mosely?
MOSELY=>What are you talking about?
CAPTAIN=>You're here to pick up a prisoner, right?
MOSELY=>How'd you know that?
CAPTAIN=>He was afraid to fly so he got off the plane. He left with an Agent Mosely.
TUTTLE=>Sir, that must mean that Walsh has your identification.
SERRANO=>I thought you said he was going to be on that plane.
DARUVO=>That's the information we got.
SERRANO=>You listen to me. I want this motherfucker's lights out. And you better get more personally involved and stop sending other people to do your job.
DARUVO=>You got it.
SERRANO=>If you don't, I'll stab you right through the heart with a fucking pencil.
DARUVO=>What did I tell you? It's going to be our ass.
THE DUKE=>Jack...
THE DUKE=>Jack...
THE DUKE=>Jack...
WALSH=>What the fuck do you want!
THE DUKE=>I told you I was claustrophobic. Jack, I know you're upset with me but it's stuffy in here. Come on, Jack, what do you think I'm going to do? Jump off a train going ninety miles an hour?
THE DUKE=>Thank you, Jack. What are you doing?
WALSH=>Arithmetic.
THE DUKE=>Maybe I can help you. I am an accountant.
WALSH=>Well, I was thinking. After I turn your ass in and collect my money, I want to open up a restaurant.
THE DUKE=>How much is it, exactly, that you're getting for me?
WALSH=>A hundred thousand.
THE DUKE=>Does that mean you'd let me go for a hundred thousand?
WALSH=>I never took a payoff in my life. I'm not going to start now.
THE DUKE=>A restaurant is a very tricky investment, Jack. More than half of them fail within the first year. As an accountant, I would have to advise you against it.
THE DUKE=>What kind of restaurant were you thinking about opening?
WALSH=>A family restaurant.
THE DUKE=>Why a family restaurant? Do you have a family, or did they break the law and you took them in, too? I'm sorry, Jack. That was uncalled for.
MOSCONE=>How the hell could he miss that plane? He called from the goddamn airport. Look at this. I'm smokin' again. Get Dorfler on the phone. See if he's still in Pittsburgh.
PITTSBURGH THUG=>Could I at least have a french fry?
DORFLER=>I told you, no. Shut up!
JERRY=>Marvin. Hang on a second. Eddie, I got him.
MOSCONE=>Marvin. I got a job for you. Big money. I gave it to Walsh, but he's fuckin' it up.
DORFLER=>Well, I don't know why you keep hirin' that guy.
MOSCONE=>I know, Marvin. You're right. You're the best. You always come through for me. So, here's the job.
DORFLER=>I'm listenin'.
MOSCONE=>You ever hear of the Duke?
DORFLER=>No.
MOSCONE=>Jonathan Mardukas. The Duke.
DORFLER=>I never heard of him.
MOSCONE=>That's okay, Marvin. It's not important. What is important is that you've got to find him and get him back here as soon as possible. Last I heard, Walsh had him in New York. But I don't know where the hell he is now. You pick him up, I'll pay you exactly what I'm payin' Walsh.
DORFLER=>What's that?
MOSCONE=>Twenty-five thousand. But you got to get him back by midnight, Friday.
DORFLER=>Don't worry. I'll get him.
DORFLER=>Hey, scumbag.
PITTSBURGH THUG=>You talkin' to me?
DORFLER=>No, the guy behind you. Today's your lucky day.
PITTSBURGH THUG=>How's that?
DORFLER=>American Express? This is Jack Walsh. Excuse me. John Wesley Walsh. I lost my card. I wanna know the last place I used it. Here's the card number.
DORFLER=>The Amtrak office at Grand Central Station?
DORFLER=>Thank you very much. By the way. Maybe we better cancel that card.
PITTSBURGH THUG=>Where are you going?
DORFLER=>I'll be back in a few minutes, jerk- off. Wait here.
THE DUKE=>Jack, this is very difficult.
WALSH=>What are you, a drug addict?
THE DUKE=>No, these are vitamins.
WALSH=>You piss ninety percent of that out of your system.
THE DUKE=>I'm not going to discuss nutrition with a man who eats deep-fried food and smokes cigarettes. And by the way, people who smoke should take extra vitamin C. If you'd like, I could outline a complete program for you.
WALSH=>Mail it to me from "C" Block.
THE DUKE=>I don't think you're as mean as you pretend to be. Why do you smoke? You know it's not good for you.
WALSH=>I don't think about it.
THE DUKE=>Well, that's living in denial.
WALSH=>I'm aware of that.
THE DUKE=>That sounds kind of foolish. Don't you think, Jack?
WALSH=>No. Stealing fifteen million dollars from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.
THE DUKE=>I didn't think I'd get caught.
WALSH=>That's living in denial.
THE DUKE=>I'm aware of that.
WALSH=>Oh, so you're aware of your behavior but continue to do things that aren't good for you? Sounds sort of foolish, don't you think, John?
THE DUKE=>What I did helped a lot of people.
WALSH=>So, you pissed off a mafioso killer just to be loved by a bunch of fucking strangers. That makes a lot of sense.
THE DUKE=>Jack, do you have a family?
WALSH=>I don't like sharing the intimate details of my life with strangers.
THE DUKE=>How far is it going to go? I'll probably be dead in a few days.
WALSH=>How do you figure that?
THE DUKE=>With what I know about Serrano and his business, I won't last twenty- four hours in jail. You know that.
WALSH=>I have an ex-wife and daughter living in Chicago.
THE DUKE=>Oh, are we going to stop off and see them?
WALSH=>I haven't seen either of them in nine years.
THE DUKE=>You haven't seen your wife and daughter in nine years?
WALSH=>What is there, an echo in here?
THE DUKE=>Your job must have been tough on them.
WALSH=>I was a cop then.
THE DUKE=>You were a cop in Chicago? You must know all about Jimmy Serrano.
WALSH=>Yeah, I even met him a couple of times.
THE DUKE=>Really? What's he like in person?
WALSH=>You have a way of worming things out of people that I don't like.
THE DUKE=>Two dollars? Is that all you're going to leave?
WALSH=>It's fifteen percent.
THE DUKE=>It's thirteen percent. Look at the bill. I'm an accountant, I know about these things.
WALSH=>What are ya gonna do? Jump out of a train goin' ninety miles an hour?
WALSH=>Go ahead. I'll get off at the next stop, scoop ya up and mail ya back to L.A.
MILES=>Trying to find your room?
DORFLER=>Nah. I'm looking for Jack Walsh's. He told me to meet him there.
MILES=>Number four. Next car.
DORFLER=>Thanks.
DORFLER=>One word and you're dead.
WALSH=>Alonzo Mosely, FBI. How'd you find out where I was?
DORFLER=>Fuck you, shitheel. I don't have to answer you. You ruined my fuckin' car.
WALSH=>Radio ahead. I want the local police at the next stop to place this man under arrest.
DORFLER=>What the hell are you talking about?
WALSH=>That's enough outta you. Go ahead. Get on the horn. Call the cops.
THE DUKE=>Who is this guy?
WALSH=>Another bounty hunter. Count your blessings he's not taking you in.
MOSELY=>Good news or bad news?
PERRY=>Mardukas and Walsh are on the Amtrak headed to Los Angeles. Apparently, another bounty hunter was arrested after he tried to take Mardukas away.
MOSELY=>I want the jet ready in 20 minutes.
MOSELY=>Where's Jack Walsh?
MILES=>He got off. With the other fella. Two or three stops ago. His real name's Mosely.
MOSELY=>I'm Mosely!
WALSH=>Get outta here! Can't you see I'm on the phone!
MOSCONE=>Get it!
JERRY=>Eddie Moscone, bail bondsman.
WALSH=>Jerry, give me Moscone.
JERRY=>Jesus, Jack, where are you?
MOSCONE=>Jack. Where the fuck are you?
WALSH=>How the hell did Dorfler end up on my ass? Did you put him on this, you son-of-a-bitch?
MOSCONE=>How could I put him on you? I don't even know where the hell you are! Jack, you still got the Duke or what?
WALSH=>Yeah, I got him.
MOSCONE=>Where the hell are you?
WALSH=>Somewhere between Cleveland and Toledo. We're about to get on a bus to L.A.
MOSCONE=>A bus? What the hell are you doing, Jack? Are you out of your mind?
WALSH=>I can't get into it right now, Eddie. I just wanted to let you know we're on our way. The bus is leaving. I'll talk to you later.
MOSCONE=>What the hell is this guy doin'?
JERRY=>I don't know, Eddie. You want me to go get some donuts or something?
MOSCONE=>What do I look like, a diabetic? And where the hell is that goddamn Dorfler?
JERRY=>I don't know, Eddie. I think I'm gonna step outside for some air.
THE DUKE=>How's our schedule doing now, Jack?
WALSH=>Don't worry. I'll get you there on time.
TICKET CLERK=>I'm sorry, sir, but this card has been canceled.
WALSH=>That's impossible.
TICKET CLERK=>I double checked it. Sorry, I can't accept it, sir.
WALSH=>How much money you got?
THE DUKE=>A lot.
WALSH=>You call that a lot of money?
THE DUKE=>I'm not the one who can't pay his credit card bills.
WALSH=>Just made it. Two tickets to L.A.
DORFLER=>Who the fuck are you?
MOSELY=>Mosely. FBI.
DORFLER=>Goddamnit! I didn't do anything!
MOSELY=>Sit down. I just want to ask you some questions.
DORFLER=>Yeah, yeah. Help yourself.
MOSELY=>What do you know about Jack Walsh?
SERRANO=>I got it. Get outta here.
SERRANO=>What do you want, Sid?
LYMAN=>I think you and I should talk. I heard somebody picked Mardukas up in New York.
SERRANO=>Yeah, it's old news. I'm on it.
LYMAN=>I don't have to tell you what will happen if he becomes a government witness.
SERRANO=>That won't be the case.
LYMAN=>I assumed you were taking that position. I am supposed to advise you against such acts.
SERRANO=>Hey, Sid. Why don't you relax and have a drink. It's all gonna be over in a couple of minutes.
THE DUKE=>You know, the way you spoke to that homeless man back there in the bus station was a perfect example of misdirected anger. You should learn to focus on what is really hurting you and work on that.
THE DUKE=>Can I ask why it is you haven't seen your wife and daughter in nine years?
WALSH=>My ex-wife got married to a police captain and I'm not very popular with the Chicago Police Department.
THE DUKE=>Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Police Department?
WALSH=>Do we know each other?
THE DUKE=>Did you do something wrong?
WALSH=>That doesn't concern you.
THE DUKE=>Are you hurt?
WALSH=>No.
THE DUKE=>I'm sorry.
WALSH=>What are you sorry about?
THE DUKE=>I asked if you were hurt and you said you were sorry.
WALSH=>I didn't say I was sorry. You said I was sorry. You're starting to put words in my mouth.
THE DUKE=>You're a grown man. You have control of your own words.
WALSH=>You goddamn right I do. So, here come two words for you. Shut the fuck up!
PERRY=>Walsh called Moscone about a half hour ago from outside of Toledo. He's on a Greyhound bus headed for Chicago.
MOSELY=>Let's go.
LOCAL DETECTIVE=>Inspector. What do we do with this guy?
MOSELY=>Let him go.
DORFLER=>Son of a bitch took my cigarettes...
DARUVO=>What's wrong with you? Do you have to touch everything? That's fuckin' annoying.
JOEY=>Do you think we'll get 'em?
DARUVO=>Fuck. They can't all miss.
THE DUKE=>Can I stretch my legs?
WALSH=>Yeah, if you can do it sitting down.
THE DUKE=>C'mon, Jack. We're going to be stuck on this thing for a couple of days.
DARUVO=>Who the hell are these guys?
JOEY=>They with us?
DARUVO=>It's the fuckin' Feds.
MOSELY=>You and I have a lot of talking to do.
MOSELY=>Remember me?
WALSH=>Oh, yeah. Agent Foster Grant. Hey, Alonzo, aren't ya gonna thank me for doing your job for ya?
MOSELY=>Thanks, Walsh.
MOSELY=>Freeze!
DARUVO=>Fuck this.
JOEY=>Yeah, hit it.
THE DUKE=>Oh, God! Oh, my God! Let me go.
WALSH=>Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
THE DUKE=>What was that? Why would they shoot at us like that?
WALSH=>Those were Serrano's people. He's not even waiting until you get to jail.
THE DUKE=>Alonzo Mosely? Isn't that the name you've been using?
WALSH=>Give me that.
WALSH=>Isn't that nice. This is Mosely's car.
THE DUKE=>If you want to turn me in, why are you running away from the FBI?
WALSH=>I only get my money when I deliver you to L.A., not to the Feds Goddamnit. They've got a wiretap on Moscone's phone line.
WALSH=>We're not gonna get too far in a stolen FBI car.
THE DUKE=>What's that for?
WALSH=>It's an inside joke between me and Alonzo.
DARUVO=>Sorry, Jimmy, it didn't happen.
SERRANO=>What was that again?
DARUVO=>It didn't happen. There were about thirty Feds there, along with local heat. A lot of heads got popped.
LYMAN=>You better get off the line, Jimmy.
SERRANO=>Shut up.
LYMAN=>If they've got a tap...
SERRANO=>I said shut up! Where's Mardukas? In custody?
DARUVO=>I don't know. There was so much commotion, I don't know.
DARUVO=>Will you knock it off!
SERRANO=>Let me make it simple for you guys. I am not to get another phone call like this. If I do? I'll blowtorch the both of yuz.
SERRANO=>Should've killed that son-of-a-bitch Walsh back in Chicago.
WALSH=>I can't believe this. I haven't seen them for nine years and the first thing out of my mouth is gonna be "can I borrow a few hundred bucks?"
THE DUKE=>I have a feeling that this is going to be very good for you.
THE DUKE=>You look great.
JASON=>Who are you guys?
WALSH=>I'm your mother's ex-husband.
JASON=>Mom!
THE DUKE=>Nice kid.
GAIL=>Jack...
WALSH=>Hi, Gail.
GAIL=>They mentioned you and him on the news this morning. Are you alright?
WALSH=>Can I come in for a few minutes?
GAIL=>You're in a lot of trouble. Did you impersonate an FBI agent?
WALSH=>Gail, I won't stay long. I need some money to get to L.A. You know I'm good for it.
WALSH=>I'm so embarrassed. I'm just in a jam. You look so beautiful.
JASON=>You don't look much like a criminal.
THE DUKE=>I'm a white-collar criminal.
GAIL=>Jack, you shouldn't be here. If Ted comes home, he'll arrest you. And him.
WALSH=>Arrest us? Then we'd really be in trouble, 'cause I'm a little short on bribe money.
GAIL=>Jack, don't start, please. Today's not a good day for this.
THE DUKE=>Yeah, Jack. Don't start.
WALSH=>I'm sorry my fugitive timetable doesn't coincide with your social calendar.
THE DUKE=>I don't think she was saying that, Jack.
WALSH=>Stay out of this, John.
GAIL=>Same old Jack. Gets his feelings hurt and tries to hurt everyone around him.
WALSH=>Gail, the last thing I need now is one of your lectures.
GAIL=>I'm trying to protect you, stupid! Ted's going to be home any minute. Tonight's a very important night for us. We're all going out.
WALSH=>What's so special about tonight? Wait. Let me guess. Payoff night.
GAIL=>That's enough!
THE DUKE=>Alright, everyone, let's not fight.
WALSH=>I'm in a big fuckin' jam. I just need some money. All I've got to do is just get this guy to L.A. and I'm out of this miserable business forever.
WALSH=>Hi. Hi, Denise.
DENISE=>Hi, Daddy.
WALSH=>You're so grown-up.
WALSH=>That's all I wanted to do. Just hold you for a minute.
WALSH=>I'll go now. I'm sorry.
GAIL=>Hang on.
GAIL=>I only have forty dollars but you can take my car if you want. I'll tell Ted it's in the shop. We'll worry about it after you get to L.A.
WALSH=>Does he take good care of you?
WALSH=>That's all I want to know. What will he say about this?
GAIL=>He'll understand.
WALSH=>That's love.
DENISE=>It isn't much. About a hundred and eighty dollars. Baby-sitting money. Take it.
WALSH=>I can't do that, sweetheart.
DENISE=>Please... Daddy.
THE DUKE=>You have a beautiful daughter, Jack.
WALSH=>I'd just like to be quiet for a while.
JERRY=>Eddie Moscone, bail bondsman.
WALSH=>Jerry, Jack. Give me Moscone.
JERRY=>Hey, Eddie, it's Jack.
MOSCONE=>Jack. Where are you?
WALSH=>I'm in Boise, Idaho.
WALSH=>No, wait a minute. I'm in Casper, Wyoming. No, wait. I'm in Anchorage, Alaska. I'm in the lobby of a Howard Johnson's. I'm wearing a pink carnation.
MOSCONE=>What the hell are you talkin' about?
WALSH=>I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to the other guys.
MOSCONE=>What other guys?
WALSH=>Let me describe the scene to you.
WALSH=>There's these guys, see? They've probably been up for two days. So, they stink of B.O., have coffee breath, and they're constipated and have hemorrhoids from sitting on their asses for so long.
WALSH=>They're sitting in a van. Probably parked up the street from your office.
WALSH=>But now they're gonna have to pack up all their shit and go home, because I'm onto them! You dumb fucks! I'm not usin' this line anymore!
WALSH=>Hey, Eddie.
MOSCONE=>Yeah, Jack.
WALSH=>Go to Denny's. I'll call you in five minutes. They can't run a tap that fast.
MOSCONE=>Right.
WALSH=>So long, everybody.
MOSCONE=>Jack?
WALSH=>I need you to wire me five hundred to the Western Union Office in Amarillo, Texas.
MOSCONE=>What do you need with five hundred on a bus? And why the hell aren't you on a plane?
WALSH=>Did it ever occur to you that I am a professional and that I might have my reasons? We're driving now and I only have enough cash to get me to Amarillo. We had to scrap the bus.
MOSCONE=>Fuck the bus, I'd like to know what happened to the goddamn plane?
WALSH=>He doesn't like to fly.
MOSCONE=>He doesn't like to fly!?! What the fuck does that mean!?! You have to be back here in less than two and a half days. What the fuck are you doing out there, Jack?
WALSH=>Eddie, I swear to God, don't start with me now or I'll shoot him and dump him in the swamp.
WALSH=>I'm in no fuckin' mood for this. Just send me the money and I'll have him back by the deadline.
MOSCONE=>Hey, Jerry, wire five hundred dollars to Walsh in Amarillo, Texas.
MOSCONE=>And maybe you ought to see if you can't get Dorfler down there, too.
THE DUKE=>Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of beer. If one of those...
THE DUKE=>What happened to you back in Chicago? Your wife married a corrupt cop?
WALSH=>They're all bad.
THE DUKE=>There's good and bad everywhere, don't you think?
WALSH=>There's bad everywhere. Good? I don't know about.
THE DUKE=>What happened to you?
WALSH=>I tried to bust this big-time dealer. The guy practically supplied the whole city with heroin. I got close to him, gained his confidence. It took me a year. Just as I was ready to nail the son-of-a-bitch, mysteriously, my fellow officers discovered seven pounds of heroin in my house. They gave me a choice. Get on the payroll like everyone else, get out of town, or go to jail for 30 years.
THE DUKE=>So you left town?
WALSH=>Yeah. And that's why I do this. When I find a criminal, like yourself, I bring him in. I don't have to worry about anybody getting bribed or paid off because there is no "anybody." There's just me.
THE DUKE=>So, I guess that means that any offer I might make would be a waste of time.
THE DUKE=>Let me ask you something. Do you miss your wife and daughter?
WALSH=>I don't think much about it.
THE DUKE=>There's that denial thing again.
WALSH=>I know in some twisted way you mean well, but will you please stay out of my personal life?
THE DUKE=>You can't just avoid the things that hurt you. You've got to attack them head on. Sooner or later you're going to have to take a "front row" approach to life, Jack.
WAITRESS=>What can I do for you, boys?
WALSH=>Two coffees.
THE DUKE=>I'd prefer herbal tea. As a bounty hunter, are you licensed to starve your victims?
WALSH=>In ten minutes we'll have five hundred bucks. I'll buy ya a nice juicy steak.
THE DUKE=>I don't eat meat. It's filled with carcinogens and steroids.
WALSH=>You know, you're a very smart guy, John. You know everything about everything. But you don't know enough to stay out of other people's business. If you had left Serrano alone, none of this would be happening to you.
THE DUKE=>I had a way out of this, Jack!
WALSH=>Oh, really.
THE DUKE=>I was going to put all of Serrano's records on computer diskettes as an insurance policy. I figured I could always trade it over in exchange for my life if things got too rough.
WALSH=>Why didn't you just leave him alone?
THE DUKE=>Why didn't you just ignore corruption in the police department?
WALSH=>Because I couldn't live with myself, that's why.
THE DUKE=>That's how I felt, Jack. I wasn't some mob accountant. I thought I worked in a legitimate firm. When I found out I was managing accounts that were really fronts for Serrano, I just couldn't sit back and do nothing.
WALSH=>So, you decided to take what didn't belong to you.
THE DUKE=>Jack, I gave practically all of it to charity. How can you take the side of a mobster?
WALSH=>I'm not taking his side.
THE DUKE=>You're taking his side, if you're not taking mine.
WALSH=>I'm not taking anybody's side. I've got nothing to do with this.
WALSH=>Time to go.
THE DUKE=>Why do you wear that old watch?
WALSH=>I'll tell you when I know you better.
JOEY=>You know what we should get? One of those little trays that you keep in the car, so you don't spill food and drinks all over the place.
DARUVO=>There they are.
DARUVO=>Don't fuckin' move asshole. I don't wanna kill you. I just want you.
DORFLER=>Drop 'em.
DORFLER=>You heard me. Drop 'em.
DORFLER=>Who the fuck are you guys?
DARUVO=>Who the fuck are you?
JOEY=>You're dead. You know who you're fuckin' with?
DORFLER=>No. Why don't you tell me about it. And make sure you speak into the microphone.
DORFLER=>Give me the keys to the cuffs.
WALSH=>Sure, Marvin.
WALSH=>Looks like a package deal to me, Marvin.
THE DUKE=>Front row, Jack!
DORFLER=>Alright, both of you, come on.
DORFLER=>Who the hell were those guys?
WALSH=>Oh, Marvin. You've done it this time.
DORFLER=>What are you talking about?
WALSH=>Those were hired killers back there.
DORFLER=>Hired to kill who?
WALSH=>Hired to kill him.
DORFLER=>Hired by who?
WALSH=>Jimmy Serrano.
DORFLER=>Oh, fuck! Why do they wanna kill him?
WALSH=>Marvin, don't ya read the newspapers?
THE DUKE=>I can't take this.
WALSH=>How the fuck did you know where we were?
THE DUKE=>I can't take this anymore.
WALSH=>Shut up a minute. Did Moscone put you on this?
DORFLER=>Of course Moscone put me on this.
WALSH=>That no good son of a bitch. I got a contract with him!
DORFLER=>You got a contract?
WALSH=>Yeah. I signed it on Monday.
DORFLER=>He called me in Pittsburgh. He said you were fuckin' this up.
WALSH=>I'm not fuckin' this up.
DORFLER=>You should of been in L.A. over two days ago.
WALSH=>Don't tell me how to do my goddamn job. I'm half-thinkin' not to turn him in just to watch Moscone go down the toilet.
THE DUKE=>That's an excellent thought.
WALSH=>This is bullshit! We're sittin' ducks, Marvin! Get off the fucking road.
THE DUKE=>Look out!
DORFLER=>Okay. Okay. I got it.
DORFLER=>Hang in. Relax. I've got it.
THE DUKE=>Nobody move.
WALSH=>Give me that.
DORFLER=>That's mine.
DORFLER=>I thought you threw those out.
WALSH=>Always check the evidence, Marvin. Those were car keys.
WALSH=>They're not after me.
WALSH=>Just kiddin'.
WALSH=>Son of a bitch! Well, Marvin, there goes a hundred grand.
DORFLER=>A hundred? You're getting a hundred?
WALSH=>Why? What was Moscone gonna pay you?
DORFLER=>Twenty-five.
WALSH=>Marvin. Give me another clip!
DORFLER=>What? I need it myself!
WALSH=>Give me the fuckin' clip!
WALSH=>Say good night, Gracie.
PILOT=>We're hit!
DORFLER=>Goddamn, Jack. You did it!
WALSH=>Marvin, watch out!
WALSH=>See you in L.A., Marvin!
THE DUKE=>Goddamnit, I was almost safe!
WALSH=>I'm slipping! Give me your hand!
THE DUKE=>Promise you'll let me go!
WALSH=>Fuck you!
THE DUKE=>Promise me!
WALSH=>Fuck you!
THE DUKE=>You're making it very hard for me to do the right thing here, Jack.
WALSH=>Alright! Alright! I'll let you go! I promise.
THE DUKE=>Where's Dorfler?
WALSH=>He's watchin' the car. Thanks for savin' me.
THE DUKE=>Thanks for letting me go.
WALSH=>I'll let you go, alright. The second you're in the L.A. County Jail.
THE DUKE=>I just saved your life!
WALSH=>Come on.
WALSH=>How's it goin', gentlemen? Do you think you can give me and my friend a ride to the nearest town?
BILLY=>Sure. Pile in.
DORFLER=>That's right! Down here! Get me the fuck outta here!
PERRY=>This just came in.
MOSELY=>Is it going to upset me?
PERRY=>I think it's safe to say that.
SERRANO=>What's the problem with you guys? The guy's a fuckin' accountant!
DARUVO=>It's been bad luck down the line. Plus this guy, Walsh, is pretty good.
SERRANO=>Well, if he's so fuckin' good, maybe I should hire him to hit you.
LYMAN=>Is any of this going to come back to him?
DARUVO=>No. None of it. We rented the chopper through Detroit.
JOEY=>It's five times removed from you. So you're clear of this. Don't worry.
SERRANO=>I'm clear of shit! He's still out there! Pull the fuck over! Get out of the car!
LYMAN=>Jimmy...
SERRANO=>Shut up, Sid. Get the fuck out of the car!
SERRANO=>I have no interest whatsoever in seeing the two of you alive again unless you have the accountant! You understand?
JOEY=>How do we get our luggage back?
BILLY=>This is the end of the ride.
WALSH=>What the hell kind of town is this?
THE DUKE=>Is there a bathroom in there I could use?
THE DUKE=>Is it alright, Jack?
WALSH=>G'head.
WALSH=>Fear of flying, you son of a bitch?
WALSH=>Fear of flying, my ass! Get out of that plane, you son of a bitch.
THE DUKE=>My work is done here, Jack. I've reopened the lines of communication between you, your ex-wife and your daughter.
WALSH=>I'm gonna open your fuckin' head.
THE DUKE=>And I think you're well on your way to reexamining who you are as a human being.
THE DUKE=>You're going to get us killed!
WALSH=>I don't give a fuck.
WALSH=>Shut the fuck up! All of ya!
WALSH=>Let me tell you about the coffee shop I'm gonna open after I dump you off and collect my hundred grand. You're gonna love it. Maybe when you get out, if they don't kill you first, you can come pay me a visit.
WALSH=>Give me the keys to the truck.
THE DUKE=>You just can't take their truck.
WALSH=>You were about to take their plane.
WALSH=>Hey, maybe I'll even call it "Duke's Place." Y'know. Out of respect to you.
THE DUKE=>Jack. Let's be fair about this. You lied to me, too. At the river you promised to let me go.
WALSH=>You lied to me first.
THE DUKE=>Yes. But the river was before you knew I had lied to you. So that really doesn't count. Don't you think, Jack?
WALSH=>What?
THE DUKE=>It's wrong that I lied to you. But you had no knowledge that I was lying about my aviophobia when we were in the river, when you lied to me.
WALSH=>I can't even argue with you. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
WALSH=>Ah, shit!
THE DUKE=>Have you got an ulcer. Jack?
WALSH=>Yes, I've got an ulcer! A big fuckin' ulcer! And all your bullshit is startin' to make it bleed again.
THE DUKE=>We better get something to coat it.
WALSH=>I need somethin' to eat! That's what I need!
THE DUKE=>I can take care of that.
WALSH=>Now what?
THE DUKE=>Give me that FBI badge.
THE DUKE=>Do you want to eat that shit you eat or not?
WALSH=>If you fuck with me...
THE DUKE=>Yeah, you'll hit me in the head and drop me in a thing...
THE DUKE=>I want to speak to the manager immediately.
CASHIER=>Alright, just a minute, sir.
RED=>May I help you?
THE DUKE=>Alonzo Mosely, FBI. My partner and I have been tracking a ring of counterfeiters who have been passing phony one-hundred-dollar bills throughout the state. Have you received any hundred-dollar bills in the last couple of hours?
RED=>I received one just 20 minutes ago.
THE DUKE=>Would you mind opening the register, please.
THE DUKE=>Let me see all of them.
THE DUKE=>No, no! Don't touch them.
THE DUKE=>Give me that pencil. Confract two.
THE DUKE=>Check all of these.
THE DUKE=>How are we doing?
WALSH=>This one's bad.
RED=>You guys look like you've been through the ringer.
WALSH=>You don't know the half of it. This one's bad, too.
THE DUKE=>I want you to describe, exactly, what the person who handed you this bill looked like.
CASHIER=>It was a man. About thirty. Tall.
THE DUKE=>Oh yeah? About six feet tall?
CASHIER=>Yeah.
THE DUKE=>What color hair?
CASHIER=>Brown.
WALSH=>Sounds like our man.
THE DUKE=>I want you to call all the other restaurants in the area and advise them of the situation. If we move fast we might be able to nail him. We have to take this for evidence. Make sure they get a receipt for this.
WALSH=>It's as good as gold.
THE DUKE=>What's the name of your establishment?
RED=>Red's Corner Bar.
THE DUKE=>Do you dye your hair?
RED=>No.
THE DUKE=>Why do they call you Red?
RED=>It's short for Redwood.
THE DUKE=>What's your first name?
RED=>Bill.
THE DUKE=>We'll be back. Thanks for your cooperation, Bill.
WALSH=>Come on. We're catchin' this train.
THE DUKE=>I can't do this.
WALSH=>You also couldn't fly. Start running.
WALSH=>Ah, shit!
WALSH=>Give me your hand!
THE DUKE=>Do you promise to let me go?
WALSH=>Goddamnit, give me your hand!
THE DUKE=>See you in the next life, Jack!
WALSH=>You son of a bitch! You're gonna have to come out of there sometime and I'm gonna be waiting here!
WALSH=>You're only making it harder on yourself, making me stay out here!
WALSH=>And don't you forget it.
WALSH=>I ain't talkin' to you for the rest of this trip.
THE DUKE=>That's adolescent. Don't you think, Jack?
DORFLER=>Hey, are you guys gonna let me go? I'm tellin' ya, I don't know anythin'.
MOSELY=>Is that a fact.
DORFLER=>Oh, shit.
DORFLER=>Yeah, yeah. Help yourself.
MOSELY=>Where are they?
DORFLER=>You got me.
PERRY=>Inspector...
MOSELY=>Shut up!
MOSELY=>I want some answers and I want them now.
DORFLER=>I don't know nothing. They went down the river. They could be dead, for all I know.
TUTTLE=>Sir?
MOSELY=>What?
TUTTLE=>It seems that an "Agent Alonzo Mosely" and his "partner" were seen hopping a westbound freight train near Channing.
THE DUKE=>C'mon, Jack. Don't be a baby. Are you going to sulk the rest of the trip?
THE DUKE=>Do you want to know when I knew I had you pegged?
THE DUKE=>The very first second we were in the car in New York. For some reason, I noticed your watch. An old Timex. Scratched. Cracked. But you hang on to it, don't you? Even when a new watch would do better by you.
THE DUKE=>Let me guess. It was a present. Someone gave it to you about 20 years ago.
THE DUKE=>You're sentimental. You hold memories as something precious. You have a desire to do what's right. I knew you wouldn't force me to fly.
WALSH=>Gail bought me this. It was the first thing she ever got me. I was always a half hour late when we were dating. So she bought me this watch and set it a half an hour fast so I'd never be late.
WALSH=>Somewhere in the back of my mind, I still imagine that we're gonna end up together. I'm still waiting. Hangin' on.
THE DUKE=>I don't think she's coming back.
WALSH=>I don't, either. The bitch...
DORFLER=>Yeah. Accommodations were wonderful. You gotta cigarette?
DESK SERGEANT=>Don't smoke.
DORFLER=>That Fed took my cigarettes. Where did everybody go?
DESK SERGEANT=>They took off. You want your cigarettes? You'll have to go to Flagstaff. Because that's where your pal Mosely went.
DORFLER=>I just might do that.
THE DUKE=>Jack. Would you care to breakfast with me?
THE DUKE=>I think these are yours anyway, Jack. I know I didn't buy any Ho-Ho's or Suzy-Q's.
WALSH=>I'm sorry I hit you.
THE DUKE=>Do you know where we are?
WALSH=>We've been going west all night. My guess is Arizona. We're almost home.
THE DUKE=>I'm almost dead.
WALSH=>The witness protection program isn't so bad. They'll give you a new name. You'll have a new life.
THE DUKE=>Jack, do me a favor, okay? Don't play this big brother routine with me because it really insults my intelligence. The only thing important to you about me is getting your money.
WALSH=>I'm tired of you making me out to be some kind of thug whose only concern is a big chunk of change. Did you know that Serrano's people offered me a million bucks for you?
THE DUKE=>Why don't you just go for the big money, Jack? You're doing his work for him either way.
WALSH=>You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. The reason I do this shit is because I didn't want to work for that lowlife. You remember that big dealer I was trying to bring down in Chicago? That was Serrano, alright? Now, you know everything. Are you happy?
THE DUKE=>He's the reason you left Chicago? And you're taking me in? Are you out of your mind? You want me to speak your language, Jack? You let that motherfucker beat you! With what you know about police work and what I know about Serrano's operation, we should be able to put him away for thirty years.
WALSH=>I'm not in that business anymore.
THE DUKE=>I'm a goddamn accountant and I tried to get him. You're this big macho guy, with your guns and all your bullshit and you're backing away?
WALSH=>I just don't have it in me.
WALSH=>We're gettin' off here. Just in case.
WALSH=>You first, wise guy.
MOSELY=>Inspector Mosely. Find anything?
POLICE CAPTAIN=>Not yet.
PERRY=>They could have jumped off the train anywhere along the line.
MOSELY=>Walsh isn't playing with a lot of time. He took this train as far as he could.
WALSH=>Arizona plates. Do I know my shit or what?
THE DUKE=>Where are we going?
WALSH=>To the next fuckin' airport.
WALSH=>Shit!
THE DUKE=>You're not going to be happy until you get us both killed.
WALSH=>I came too far. I'm too close.
POLICE CAPTAIN=>Follow me to the chopper!
WALSH=>How many fuckin' cops can they have in this town?
THE DUKE=>I know you can do it, Jack!
MOSELY=>Check the other side.
MOSELY=>There's the Jeep.
MOSELY=>Try the farm. Close to the ground.
THE DUKE=>Jack! Don't! It's Dorfler!
DINER OWNER=>Bad day, huh?
WALSH=>Bad week.
DINER OWNER=>I know what you mean.
WALSH=>I could use a cup of coffee.
DINER OWNER=>I think I could arrange that.
WALSH=>I've been lookin' all over for these.
THE DUKE=>I can't do this. I have a very serious fear of flying.
MOSELY=>Forget about your time clock, Walsh. It's over. That's how that one went.
WALSH=>I know my rights. You owe me some phone calls.
MOSELY=>What should be of paramount importance to you, right now, is the ten years you're going to get for impersonating a Federal agent.
WALSH=>Ten years for impersonating a Fed? How come no one's after you?
MOSELY=>You don't know when to quit.
WALSH=>I know one thing. I know my rights. And by law, you owe me phone calls. I ain't sayin' shit 'til I get them.
MOSELY=>Give him his calls.
JERRY=>Eddie Moscone, bail bondsman.
WALSH=>It's Walsh. Give me Moscone.
JERRY=>Eddie. Pick it up. It's Jack!
MOSCONE=>I hope you're gettin' close, 'cause you only got five hours.
WALSH=>No, I'm not, Eddie. But, I'm callin' to let you know that you're a dead man, you lying son of a bitch. You put Dorfler on this fuckin' thing...
MOSCONE=>Well, I should kill you. You stupid son of a bitch! You had the guy five days ago. What the hell are you joyridin' cross-country for? And are you nuts, tellin' Dorfler that I was givin' you a hundred grand when I offered him twenty-five? He just called me up yellin' and screamin'. And why the hell can't you get the Duke here in five hours?
WALSH=>When did you speak to Dorfler?
MOSCONE=>Five minutes ago. He told me to go fuck myself. What the hell difference does it make?
MALE VOICE=>Hello?
WALSH=>Yeah. Is Tony or Joey there?
MALE VOICE=>Who's this?
WALSH=>Dorfler.
MALE VOICE=>Sure, Marvin, hang on. I'm gonna forward your call.
JOEY=>Marvin?
WALSH=>No, it's Jack Walsh. So, Dorfler's workin' for you guys now.
JOEY=>What are you complainin' for? We came to you first.
JOEY=>It's Jack Walsh.
DARUVO=>Hey, too late scumbag...
WALSH=>No, too late for you. I didn't come this far not to collect my money. I want the Duke back.
DARUVO=>So what the fuck are you telling me for?
WALSH=>What am I telling you for? Because I've got some of the Duke's belongings, that's why. Including some computer disks that have every last detail of Serrano's businesses and money-laundering operations, and if I don't get him back in the next two hours I'm gonna turn them over to the Feds.
DARUVO=>I'll blow your fuckin' brains out.
WALSH=>How are you gonna do that from jail?
WALSH=>You tell Serrano, I wanna meet him with the Duke alone in two hours, in the main terminal of McCarran Airport, where we'll make the exchange. I know he's the only one of you guys who won't try to take a shot at me in a public place. If I see one single goon within a mile of that airport, the deal's off and I'm goin' to the Feds.
DARUVO=>I ain't gonna tell him that.
WALSH=>Fine. After he's busted I'll make sure to tell him you knew about it beforehand. That's two hours from now. Main terminal, McCarran Airport. You got that, moron? Have a nice day.
PERRY=>What was that?
WALSH=>Where's Mosely? I wanna make a deal.
PERRY=>Inspector!
WALSH=>What would you do if I could deliver you Serrano?
MOSELY=>How do you mean "deliver"?
WALSH=>Well... for starters, conspiracy to destroy government evidence.
MOSELY=>What government evidence?
WALSH=>Would you let me take the Duke in myself and collect my money?
MOSELY=>Tell me more.
WALSH=>Well, I'll have to tell you on the way because we've got to be in Las Vegas in two hours.
DORFLER=>Hold that up. So they'll know that I took these today. See? I got it all figured out. Say "cheese."
THE DUKE=>Don't do this, Marvin.
DORFLER=>Adiós.
PERRY=>If he takes those disks, even though they're blank, that's the overt act, correct?
WALSH=>If he just sets foot in the airport, he's committed an overt act. Conspiracy to obstruct justice.
WALSH=>If he shows up with the Duke, you can add kidnapping. If he shows up with anyone packing a gun, you can add conspiracy to commit murder. The fact that it's an airport... Alonzo, correct me if you think I'm wrong here... ...you can slap an ITAR rap on him as well.
PERRY=>Do you think he'll show?
WALSH=>Oh, he'll show. He's got no choice.
MOSELY=>Get a wire on him.
DARUVO=>Marvin?
DORFLER=>Yeah. Hey, look I'm sorry about what happened back at the Western Union office. You can imagine my embarrassment when I found out who you were. I didn't mean to hit you. It was just one of those things. You know. Like a spur of the moment. You know I'd never pull any shit like that.
JOEY=>What the fuck took you?
DORFLER=>I made a quick stop.
DARUVO=>Where is he?
DORFLER=>Where's my money?
DARUVO=>It's in the car. Where is he?
DORFLER=>Slight change of plans. Now I want two million dollars. I read the newspapers, ya know. This guy got you for fifteen million. So I figured he's gotta be worth at least two to ya. You can't play me for a chump.
DARUVO=>How do we know you've got him?
DORFLER=>A million now. Then I call you in twenty minutes. Tell you where to drop off the second million. Once I know it's there, I tell you where he is.
DORFLER=>Okay?
JOEY=>Not okay.
DORFLER=>Why not?
JOEY=>Whatayou fucking nuts! What's Jimmy gonna say!?! How the fuck are we gonna get the Duke now!?!
DARUVO=>You got the answer right in your hands!
JOEY=>What are you talking about?
DARUVO=>Joey, when are you going to learn how to pay attention?
DARUVO=>Look, see what it says there?
SERRANO=>I want ten of our best people and I don't want any fuck-ups this time. As soon as I get ahold of these things, I want them both dropped.
LYMAN=>I don't think you should do this.
SERRANO=>Oh, you don't? What do you propose I do?
LYMAN=>Send somebody with a cash offer. Give this guy whatever the hell he wants but don't do this.
SERRANO=>Walsh won't take any money from me. He knows I'd come and get it an hour later. In his mind this is clean. He gets what he wants. I get what I want. The guy's a fuckin' burnout. He just wants his money.
LYMAN=>Jimmy, listen...
SERRANO=>Sydney. Sit down. Relax. Have a sandwich. Drink a glass of milk. Do some fucking thing.
FBI AGENT=>He's on his way.
AGENT=>We're on him.
MOSELY=>This is Mosely.
AGENT=>Serrano's just left and is heading west on Vegas Boulevard.
MOSELY=>Why are you smiling?
WALSH=>I feel like a cop again.
SERRANO=>So we finally meet. I'm in the presence of greatness. "The Duke." A man who robs from the scum of the earth and gives to the unfortunates of the world. I wanted to meet you face-to-face.
SERRANO=>Did you actually think that you were going to steal my money and get away with it? I stopped by here to tell you two things. Number one is that you're going to die tonight. Number two, I'm going to go home, have a nice hot meal, then find your wife and I'm going to kill her too.
SERRANO=>Joey, stay here and wait for my call. The rest of you come with me.
FBI AGENT=>Here he comes.
SERRANO=>Jack, long time no see.
WALSH=>Long time no see.
SERRANO=>I see you're still spending all of your money on clothes.
WALSH=>Well, you know...
SERRANO=>Listen, while you're in town, if you'll want to see a show... or a free meal or something like that, you let me know. On me. That's just the type of guy I am.
WALSH=>You're a real sport.
MOSELY=>Just give him the disks.
SERRANO=>How's your mother?
WALSH=>She's alright.
SERRANO=>Daughter's getting big... growing up and all, huh?
SERRANO=>You know I was thinking, maybe if we'd done business way back when, you wouldn't look like a guy with a fucking cup in your hand.
WALSH=>Trying to make a living.
SERRANO=>You got the disks or did you lose them too? Like your job.
MOSELY=>Give him the disks, Walsh.
WALSH=>Well, I see you but I don't see the Duke.
SERRANO=>We'll worry about him in a minute.
WALSH=>No, we have to worry about him now. This isn't a fucking reunion. If I don't see him in five seconds, I'm walking.
SERRANO=>You're still way too serious. Why don't we take a walk together and go get him.
WALSH=>Fuck you. See you at the arraignment.
SERRANO=>Alright, Jack. Hold up. You win.
WALSH=>I said no goons.
SERRANO=>Don't worry about him. You're going to get what you want.
DORFLER=>One-way ticket to L.A.
TICKET CLERK=>Smoking or nonsmoking?
DORFLER=>Take a wild guess.
PERRY=>Ah, shit...
MOSELY=>I'm going to have a heart attack before this is over...
SERRANO=>Give me the disks.
WALSH=>Ah fuck... Marvin, take a hike.
DORFLER=>No way!
WALSH=>You're missing the bigger picture here, Marvin.
TUTTLE=>The wire's gone dead.
WALSH=>Marvin! Watch out, watch out!
DORFLER=>I'm not falling for that shit again.
WALSH=>Will you look out!
WALSH=>He's got the disks. He's got the disks.
WALSH=>Serrano's got the disk! Serrano's got the disk!
WALSH=>You know, there's something I've been wanting to say to you for ten years.
SERRANO=>Oh, yeah? What's that?
WALSH=>You're under arrest.
WALSH=>We still have a deal, Alonzo?
MOSELY=>We have a deal.
DORFLER=>Why does he get special treatment?
WALSH=>See you in L.A., Marvin.
DORFLER=>Watch your cigarettes with this guy, Jack.
THE DUKE=>What are you doing?
WALSH=>We've still got an hour and a half to get you to L.A.
WALSH=>When I took this job, I figured I'd never make it. Not in a million years. But for a hundred grand, I had to give it a try. If you had your way, what would you do? Where would you go?
THE DUKE=>Mexico. Call Dana, my wife. Have her collect whatever money we've got stashed. Meet me in Mazatlán. Nobody would bother us and we'd live well down there.
WALSH=>Drink margaritas and watch the sun go down?
THE DUKE=>Every single night.
WALSH=>That coffee shop would've been nice.
MOSCONE=>Eddie Moscone, bail bondsman.
WALSH=>Hey, Eddie, where's Jerry?
MOSCONE=>The Feds picked him up twenty minutes ago.
WALSH=>What for?
MOSCONE=>What's the difference? I never trusted that guy. Where the hell are you?
WALSH=>I'm in L.A. with the Duke. You want to say hello?
THE DUKE=>Hello.
WALSH=>Now, say good-bye you lying piece of shit because I'm letting him go.
WALSH=>May your footsteps be heard in heaven before the devil knows you're gone.
THE DUKE=>I don't get it.
WALSH=>I did what I wanted to do. I got you to L.A. before midnight.
THE DUKE=>I don't know what to say.
WALSH=>Don't say anything. Get out of here before I change my mind.
THE DUKE=>Thank you.
WALSH=>No, John. Thank you.
WALSH=>Remember our adventure.
THE DUKE=>I'll treasure it. I've got a gift for you too, Jack.
WALSH=>What's that?
THE DUKE=>When we first met, I was packing to make my getaway because... ...I thought the FBI was closing in. So I took a little traveling money.
WALSH=>You sonofabitch...
THE DUKE=>I told you I had money.
WALSH=>I know you had money. I didn't know you had money.
THE DUKE=>It's not a payoff, it's a gift. You already let me go.
WALSH=>How much is here?
THE DUKE=>In the neighborhood of three hundred thousand.
WALSH=>That's one of my favorite neighborhoods.
THE DUKE=>Take care, Jack. If you're ever in Mazatlán...
WALSH=>Yeah, John. I'll look you up. Just get rid of that dog of yours.
WALSH=>Twenty-five minutes to midnight, Walsh. You would've made it.
WALSH=>You got change of a thousand?
CAB DRIVER=>Get outta here, you bum!
WALSH=>Looks like I'm walking.
