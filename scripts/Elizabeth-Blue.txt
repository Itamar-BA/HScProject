GRANT=>Coming right up.
ELIZABETH=>This is more my anxiety than obsessiveness.
GRANT=>It’s important.
GRANT=>Are you hearing?
ELIZABETH=>And the Haldol isn’t working either. I’m still hearing voices almost every day. I feel like the Luvox is the only thing working but it’s not 100%.
DR. BOWMAN=>And what did he say?
GRANT=>Did you take your pills?
ELIZABETH=>I’m falling apart.
ELIZABETH=>I want it to all be perfect.
DR. BOWMAN=>I’m going to prescribe a drug called Saphris. It’s a dissolvable tab that comes in 5 and 10 milligram doses. It can be very effective and is generally well tolerated.
ELIZABETH=>I don’t know, maybe?
ELIZABETH=>Where are you going?
ELIZABETH=>Mom, what are you doing here?
ELIZABETH=>So ...can I get you anything?
ELIZABETH=>Don’t smoke in my apartment.
GRANT=>You’re amazing.
GRANT=>Good girl. You know what?
ELIZABETH=>I’m working on it.
DR. BOWMAN=>That was nice of her.
GRANT=>You coming to bed babe?
ELIZABETH=>Start living life Elizabeth.
DR. BOWMAN=>I understand how real these hallucinations might feel when they’re happening, but they’re not.
ELIZABETH=>Like I’m living in a bad dream that I can’t wake up from. My relationship is suffering from this. He says it’s not. Grant says everything is okay and that we’ll get through this together. I don’t know if I believe him. I want to.
