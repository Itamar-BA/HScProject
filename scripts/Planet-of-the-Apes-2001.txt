INSERT: The cages are marked with METALLIC SQUARES stamped with SERIAL NUMBER and NICKNAME. Pericles scoots to the comforting arms of CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER LT. COL. GRACE ALEXANDER. Alexander Was the homo sapien mean to you again? We all know it's just rocket envy. leo Ever consider an actual boyfriend? Alexander You mean do I enjoy being miserable? I'll stick with my chimps. Pericles jumps up on a counter. Pulls on a CABINET. Leo takes a BISCUIT from a huge bag of TREATS. Puts it behind his back, then holds out his hands. Pericles chooses right, nothing; left, not there either. Pericles squawks.
ALEXANDER=>When you frustrate them, they lose focus ... get confused. Even violent. Across the room a CHIMP screeches and rattles its CAGE. Alexander brings Pericles over. Alexander Congratulations, Pericles, you're going to be a daddy. leo I thought I saw a smirk on his face. Alexander Actually, the female was the aggressive one. She looks right at Leo. Leo reacts.

VASICH=>Get your monkey ready. Leo doesn't move. Looks at the other pilots. leo Sir, this is a waste of time. vaSICH We have standard procedures ... leo And by the time you go through all of them, it could be gone.

EXT. FOREST - follow leo He runs the other way. Cutting in front of him is a stocky Human trying to flee with a LITTLE HUMAN GIRL in his arms. RACK FOCUS -- BEHIND GUNNAR -- TWO GORILLAS chase him down. One GORILLA plucks the child from his arms. The OTHER GORILLA knocks him forward. APES swarm over him. KARUBI and DAENA lead the humans through a stand of small saplings. The APES sweep across ripping the trees out of the ground by their roots. CLOSER ON KARUBI -- breathing hard, afraid, listening closely. But ATTAR attacks like a force of nature, graceful with his power, unrestrained with his speed. The humans in his way are overwhelmed. Only Karubi and Daena are left at large from this group. NEW ANGLE: a slight BOY eludes several APES. Feral and wild, he is very agile. But he doesn't see an APE HANGING ONTO A TREE A LIMB. THE APE SNAGS BIRN WITH HIS FEET. Wrenches him into the air. KARUBI circles back to try and rescue the Boy. Two more APES drop down -- slam him to his knees. Daena is bowled over. Karubi covers her with his body as a NET envelops them. EXT. FOREST - leo kneels behind a tree stump to catch his breath. Several APES drag human BODIES away. Leo tries to take this all in. AN APE ON HORSEBACK crashes through the brush dragging two HUMANS behind. Leo waits til the Ape rides by --- then launches himself at the APE RIDER. Grabbing onto the reins, swinging himself up and KNOCKING THE APE off his mount. Leo flips onto the horse. Tries to ride through the attack. EXT.

Out of a HAZE OF DUST we see A DOZEN ORNATE CARTS WITH CAGES being loaded with HUMANS. The CARTS are painted brightly with strange markings and symbols. ATTAR is directing the loading of the carts. The humans are literally THROWN inside. We see DAENA tossed inside one cart. Then GUNNAR, BIRN. And finally, KARUBI, who's been beaten severely. find leo in a group of a dozen other HUMANS. An APE binds Leo's hand tightly. Suddenly all the HUMANS BOW THEIR HEADS, cower, turn their eyes to the ground. LEO'S POV: the SUN enshrouds a DARK SILHOUETTE MOVING TOWARDS THE CAPTIVES. ATTAR comes to attention -- with obvious pride at the success of the hunt. REVEAL AN APE IN A GLITTERING GOLD UNIFORM RIDING A MASSIVE BLACK CHARGER. This is THADE, GENERAL OF THE APE ARMY. Leo reads the reactions: a sense of glory from the Apes; intense fear from the Humans. PUNCH CLOSE ON THADE AS HE WHEELS HIS HORSE AROUND AND MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH LEO. Leo is the only human staring right at THADE. Thade's reaction is lightning quick: in a blur he's off his horse and in front of Leo. Grabs Leo by the hair. In a fury.
LIMBO=>Very touching. Really. I can't see for the tears in my eyes. He drags Daena by the hair into FEMALE PEN. Karubi struggles to reach his daughter. One HANDLER almost breaks his arm hurling him into the cage. Karubi shouts, collapses in pain. Children are pulled from their Mothers. Put in separate pens. LEO is thrown in the MALE PEN with Gunnar. Amazed at what's happening around him. Birn bites the hand of one HANDLER. LIMBO appears -- grabs Birn, shakes him hard, and tosses him in. Leo helps the boy to his feet. limbo How many times do I have to tell you? Wear your gloves when you handle humans. thade Are you softening, Limbo? LIMBO spins to see THADE -- mounted, followed by ATTAR. Limbo turns from tyrant to toady in a second. tHADE You used to hack off a limb. liMBO Yes, General... but unfortunately he's worth more intact. Attar goes to the cage and spots Leo. attAR Don't turn your back on this one. He's feisty. Karubi watches Leo closely. Limbo talks quickly trying to suck up to Thade. limbo These the ones raiding the orchards, sir? I know an old country remedy that never fails. Gut one and string the carcass up ...
THADE=>The human rights faction is already nipping at my heels. limbO Do-gooders. Who needs them? I'm all for free speech... as long as they keep their mouths shut.
ARI=>They're not dumb. They can be taught to live with us ... and I'm going to prove it. LEO reaches out for a CHAIN snaked in the dirt -- suddenly whips it around the foot of his HANDLER. Yanks him off balance. His SPEAR flies from his hand. Leo grabs it. Points it right at Ari's neck. limbo There's your 'proof'. Now I'll have to put him down. Karubi and Daena watch intently. widen Leo wraps an arm, around Ari; tries to maneuver her to the gate. The HANDLERS surround them. Offering a low growl. Leo looks over at the gate. He knows he won't make it. CLOSER: LEO LOCKS EYES WITH ARI. Ari is thrown by the intimacy of this act. No human has ever dared look her in the eyes this way. LEO LEANS INSIDE THE 'SPACE' BETWEEN HUMANS AND APES. HE SPEAKS INTENSELY. leo Please ... help me. Ari is startled, frozen.
ANGLE=>DAENA realizes the HANDLERS have been distracted by Leo. The DOOR TO THE FEMALE PEN is still open. She suddenly breaks out and runs for the gate. Limbo knocks her down hard. Turns furiously to Ari. limbo Look what you've started. Now I'm getting a headache. Leo starts to back up, pressing the spear to her neck. leo Get back. Limbo raises his hands, as if he's scared. limBO Oh, please, please don't hurt her. Leo keeps his eyes on Limbo's hands -- and doesn't see LIMBO USE HIS FOOT to reach up and grab the spear. In one second he wallops Leo. Stands over him. limBO Who needs this aggravation. Hold him. Limbo hefts the spear. Ari makes her choice -- arI Sell him to me. limBO Are you crazy? He's wild... ... they're both wild. arI Then I'll buy them both. Limbo freezes -- a look comes over his face. Nothing gets his attention like money. Leo and Daena exchange a look. liMBO That would be expensive ... very expensive. ari I'm sure we could come to a deal. Limbo scratches his head. He can't resist. arI Deliver them to my house. liMBO I'll have to mark him first. In one quick thrust Limbo BRANDS Leo. CHAPTER 10: THE DINNER PARTY WIDE SHOT: EXT.
