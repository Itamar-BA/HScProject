DAVID=>Nancy? Nancy?
NANCY=>What?
DAVID=>Sleeping?
NANCY=>Yes.
DAVID=>Maybe we shouldn't move.
NANCY=>Oh God. What's the matter now?
DAVID=>Nothing. It's just time to ask these questions.
NANCY=>No. We've sold our house and bought another one. These questions should have been asked before.
DAVID=>Okay, fine. I can't talk to you. Good night.
NANCY=>Stop it. You're nervous about tomorrow. You'll get your promotion, don't worry. We'll move into our new house and we'll be happy, okay?
DAVID=>Boy, you should hear yourself. The excitement in your voice just fills the room.
NANCY=>Look, I'm tired. Stop questioning. We made a wise decision. Let's try and feel good about it, alright?
DAVID=>Fine.
NANCY=>Good night.
DAVID=>Good night.
DAVID=>But why that house?
NANCY=>What?
DAVID=>I think it's too close to here. It's going to feel like the same place. Maybe we really didn't think about this long enough.
NANCY=>We thought about it forever. We wanted more space. That house has more space.
DAVID=>Yes, but the point of a house is not just space. You can rent space. Maybe we should've moved into a completely different neighborhood, a step up or something. Maybe we should've gotten a house with a tennis court.
NANCY=>Why? We don't play tennis.
DAVID=>Sure we don't play tennis. We don't have a court. When you have a court, you learn.
NANCY=>Well, possibly some day, we'll have a court and then we can learn.
DAVID=>Let me ask you one more question? Why did we let Bekins do all of our packing?
NANCY=>What?
DAVID=>Isn't that a waste of money? We could've packed ourselves. Maybe we were too irresponsible.
NANCY=>I don't believe you. One minute you want a tennis court, the next minute you're worried about Bekins packing a box? My God. Sometimes I wish we really were irresponsible.
DAVID=>What does that mean?
NANCY=>Nothing. Look, get some sleep, okay? You'll feel better.
DAVID=>Don't assume how I'm feeling. What do you mean "nothing"? If you're saying we should be more irresponsible, I imagine you mean we're too responsible? Is that right?
NANCY=>Well, sometimes I think that we are too controlled, yes.
DAVID=>Oh, I see. Well, tell me something? How do you go out and buy a four-hundred-thousand- dollar house and let a moving company pack everything and get maids and servants and live the good life and not be controlled?
NANCY=>What are you talking about?
DAVID=>It doesn't matter what I'm talking about.
DAVID=>I'm going to sleep in the garage.
NANCY=>Don't do that.
DAVID=>Why not? I'm responsible. I should be guarding the car.
NANCY=>You're insane.
DAVID=>You're right. I am insane. I am insane and I'm responsible. A very, very good combination.
DAVID=>I am not an animal.
NANCY=>What?
DAVID=>I am not an animal. I will not sleep in the garage.
NANCY=>Just come to bed. Come on.
DAVID=>I apologize, okay? But don't call me names.
NANCY=>What names?
DAVID=>You know what names. Calling me responsible is saying what? That I'm closed up. I'm old. I'm stodgy. That's not fair. I don't like the way things are any more than anybody else does but what am I supposed to do? I'm trying. What about you? You're as responsible as I am. Personnel Director for a department store is not the most irresponsible job in the world. Go hire anyone you want. Think you'd be fired fast if you did that? How much freedom do you have? We're all in the same boat. We're trying to make something of ourselves and it's hard. Okay?
NANCY=>You're very upset. I'm sorry I used that word.
DAVID=>No, I'm glad you used that word. It's honest but things are going to get better. They're going to change.
NANCY=>You always say that.
DAVID=>Yes, but this time it's different. After tomorrow I'm no longer an employee, I'm a Vice President. I'll be my own boss. I'll have a piece of the company. You see what I mean? I can be more irresponsible because I'll be in a position of responsibility. That makes sense, doesn't it?
NANCY=>I don't know. I guess it does. Good night.
DAVID=>Okay, go to sleep.
DAVID=>It does make sense and things will work out, don't you think so?
DAVID=>Nancy?
DAVID=>Asleep already?
DAVID=>Maybe men are supposed to fall asleep last. It could be a protective thing.
DAVID=>What can I say? I'd be a liar if I tell you I'm surprised. I do feel it's deserved but yes, I still am flattered... That's very nice. Thank you... Oh, stop, please. I've never been good at taking too many compliments at once... Well, I feel the same way about you.
NANCY=>What are you doing?
DAVID=>Why? Nothing.
NANCY=>Who are you talking to?
DAVID=>I'm not talking to anybody. What is it?
NANCY=>I'm leaving now. Mr. Taft will be there in twenty minutes. Please be on time.
DAVID=>Wait a second. I can't do this today. I can't choose tiles. This is my big day. Please? You do it.
NANCY=>We're trying to do this together. I think it's important.
DAVID=>I'm very nervous and it's your kitchen anyway. You'll make the right choice.
NANCY=>You're in the kitchen more than I am.
DAVID=>But I'm not thinking about anything when I'm in the kitchen. I don't really care.
NANCY=>We said we would make these decisions together.
DAVID=>Come on. It's just today.
NANCY=>Fine.
DAVID=>Please don't be mad.
NANCY=>I'm not mad.
NANCY=>Good luck. You'll get it. You deserve it.
DAVID=>Thank you. And I trust any decision you make. You have great taste.
DAVID=>Really, you have great taste. I'm sorry. That was my wife... Yes, she has wonderful taste. She's going to choose the whole tile thing herself. Originally, we were going to do it together but it's nice to be able to trust someone, don't you think?... Well, that's very nice. I trust you, too. Hey!... When our house is finished maybe you'd like to come over and play tennis... No, but we might put one in.
DAVID=>Morning.
SUSAN=>Good morning. Your meeting is in forty-five minutes.
DAVID=>Oh my God. What time is it now?
SUSAN=>Ten-thirty.
DAVID=>Okay. Ten-thirty, eleven, eleven-fifteen ... okay. Susan, don't let any calls in. I don't want to be bothered. I don't want to do any business. I just want to prepare.
DAVID=>Oh yes. Get me Valley Mercedes, will you?
PATTY=>Hi.
NANCY=>Hi.
PATTY=>Is it beautiful?
NANCY=>What?
PATTY=>The kitchen. What does it look like?
NANCY=>I chose an orange tile.
PATTY=>Orange?
NANCY=>A burnt orange.
PATTY=>Sounds pretty.
NANCY=>Patty, close the door.
PATTY=>What's the matter?
NANCY=>I'm going to hate this house.
PATTY=>What are you talking about?
NANCY=>When the contractor left this morning, I was all alone there and I sat in the middle of the living room and I got so sad. I got this preview of the next ten years, I just started shaking.
NANCY=>I'm so unhappy. I don't like anything anymore. I don't like my job. I don't like my life. I don't like anything. I feel dead.
PATTY=>What do you mean?
NANCY=>Nothing's changing. I'm not growing. David's not growing. We've just stopped. Life is passing us by.
PATTY=>Listen, you've had a tough week. With the moving and everything you're very tired. When you get tired you feel bad. Things seem worse.
NANCY=>I'm not that tired. Do you know I've been hiring girls who are nineteen years old, who've already had more experience out of life than I have?
PATTY=>You don't know that. You can't tell what a person has experienced just by interviewing them.
NANCY=>Okay. Let's forget it. I really haven't thought this through enough. I don't want to discuss it now. Let's get to work.
PATTY=>No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say the wrong thing. Have you talked this over with David?
NANCY=>Of course not. That's the problem. I can't talk anything over with him. It's hopeless.
PATTY=>Are you thinking of splitting up?
NANCY=>Well, that's not my first choice but what's the alternative? And I'm not blaming David. I know he genuinely believes that being made Vice President is going to change things. But he genuinely believed that every promotion would change things. It never does. Maybe for a few days, but that's it. Then things are always the same.
PATTY=>Well, this is vice president. Maybe this time it will change.
NANCY=>And what if it won't?
PATTY=>Then it won't. Then you get divorced, I don't know. Whatever you have to do.
NANCY=>Oh, God. Maybe it will.
PATTY=>It will or it won't.
NANCY=>Okay. I'm starting to feel sick to my stomach. Thanks for talking to me. Let's just say maybe it will.
PATTY=>Good. Because if it won't, it won't anyway so what can you do?
NANCY=>We said we'd stop on "will."
PATTY=>We did. We've stopped. It will.
PATTY=>It will. It will work out.
DAVID=>Oh, then tax, license, out-the- door, everything included, what are we talking about?... Thirty- six thousand, five hundred and twelve. Jesus! For a car... No, I know, a Mercedes. It's still a car... Well, I don't care. To me, if it has wheels, it's a car. But that's not the point. Now, that's everything, right? That's it? You don't have to pay that money and then be told that there are options? No extras, everything included... Come on! - For thirty- seven thousand, leather is extra? What kind of seats are in there?... What is Mercedes Leather?... So, why don't you just say vinyl?... Okay, thick vinyl, but it's still vinyl... Okay, these kind of semantic arguments are silly.
DAVID=>Just a moment. Yes?
SUSAN=>It's eleven ten.
DAVID=>Thank you. Susan, I have another one of these Mercedes guys on the phone, he won't hang up. Would you do something with him please?
DAVID=>What can I say? I guess, thank you... Oh, no. I can't take your office. This is too nice. Where would you sit?... Well, you are a very generous man.
SUSAN=>No! We will call you back. What a strange job to be arrogant in.
DAVID=>I know.
SUSAN=>Good luck. Don't worry, you've got it.
DAVID=>Thanks, Susan.
MARGARET=>Well, you look very nice.
DAVID=>Thank you and so do you, Margaret.
MARGARET=>Go on in.
DAVID=>Thanks.
PAUL=>Hello, David. How are you?
DAVID=>I'm fine. I'm excited.
PAUL=>Me too.
DAVID=>That's wonderful.
PAUL=>David, I'd like you to meet Brad Tooley.
DAVID=>Brad, it's a pleasure.
PAUL=>Brad has recently joined the agency in New York. He was one of the best men at Doyle, Dane and Bernbach. We were lucky to get him.
DAVID=>Well, that's exciting.
PAUL=>David, I don't have to tell you what I think of you. You know I feel you're one of the most creative people in this company. I was telling Brad earlier the accounts you've been responsible for.
BRAD=>Very impressive. The Knudsen Orange Juice campaign was one of the best I've ever seen. Ever.
DAVID=>Well, thank you.
PAUL=>Brad has joined this company for a very special reason. David, we're going to get Ford.
DAVID=>Oh, my God! That's wonderful!
PAUL=>Well, it finally puts us at the top of the heap.
DAVID=>I'm stunned. When did this happen?
PAUL=>Just in the last few days. You're really the first to know out here. We didn't want to say anything until it was final.
DAVID=>That's wonderful. Just wonderful. God, what a week. What a week for all of us.
PAUL=>It certainly is. Now, David...
DAVID=>Paul, you don't have to say anything. As the new vice president, I know what this means to the company. I'm here twenty-four hours a day.
PAUL=>David, you're too valuable to become vice president. I'd like you to move to New York and work under Brad. You two are going to be in charge of Ford. You're going to have to hurry, though. You start in three weeks.
DAVID=>Wait a second. You gave me too much information. I'm valuable and I'm vice president?
PAUL=>No, David. I've hired Paul Shubano as vice president.
DAVID=>What?
BRAD=>He's giving you quite a compliment, David. I asked him for the best man he had and he didn't hesitate for a moment.
DAVID=>He didn't? Well, I don't want to move to New York.
PAUL=>What?
DAVID=>I want to be the vice president. I want to be a stockholder in this company. It was promised to me. I don't mind working on Ford. Don't get me wrong. I think it would be a joy to work on but I'll work on it as vice president. I've been here eight years, Paul. I don't want to be transferred to just another account.
PAUL=>This is not "just another" account, David.
BRAD=>It's Ford.
DAVID=>Brad, I know it's Ford. I've owned Fords, okay? Now, Paul, I feel it's only fair to keep your promise.
PAUL=>I didn't promise you anything.
DAVID=>Wait a minute. What about these lunches that we've been having for the last four years? I believe we talked about grooming me for vice president. Phil Shubano's been here only three years. Why?
PAUL=>Well, first of all, quite frankly, he's not as clever as you. He's more of an executive type.
DAVID=>Oh, great. I think that's wonderful. So, by being extra clever, I get thrown out of the town that I live in, with no promotion, no nothing, and just shifted to another account. He, on the other hand, because of his low intelligence and short time with the company stays here, gets a large amount of stock and becomes vice president. Well, that makes sense!
PAUL=>You keep referring to this as "another account." It's not. It's Ford.
DAVID=>Why don't you stop saying that? You sound like Dinah Shore. Now, damn it, look, this isn't fair. Paul, if I'm working myself up and this is a joke, I'll kill you. Are they going to burst in here and say, "Surprise!"? Goddamnit. You almost had me fooled!
PAUL=>No one's bursting in here, David. I'm offering you something very big.
DAVID=>No one's bursting in here?
PAUL=>No.
DAVID=>No? Oh God. But, wait a minute, I'm vice president, right?
PAUL=>No.
DAVID=>Yes!
PAUL=>No.
DAVID=>Stop saying no! Just a minute. I can't go to New York. This is my home. My wife and I live here. I just bought a four-hundred thousand dollar house. I'm picking tile out at this very moment. What am I going to do? Burn it down?
PAUL=>Don't worry about that, please? You won't lose a penny on the house. We'll take care of it. I think Ford is more important than a single family dwelling, anyway. We'll get you more than you paid for it. The important thing is that you and Brad get along.
DAVID=>Me and Brad get along? Are you crazy? I've worked here eight years, for what? For me and Brad to get along? I was born in this city. All my friends are here. I like it. We're joking, aren't we? This is a joke.
PAUL=>What do you mean, a joke?
DAVID=>What do you mean, a joke?
PAUL=>I didn't say a joke.
DAVID=>I'm going to New York City?
PAUL=>I'd like you there in three weeks.
DAVID=>Oh, you would?
PAUL=>This can be a stepping stone to something bigger, David.
DAVID=>What's bigger than being vice president? That's all I want. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think I've already stepped on every stone we have here, haven't I?
PAUL=>Well, someday you might be vice president.
DAVID=>Someday? What do you mean? It's today. I've got it!
PAUL=>You don't have it.
DAVID=>Who has it?
PAUL=>David, I can't say this again. Phil Shubano.
DAVID=>Well, obviously, I'm blocking this man's name, aren't I?
BRAD=>David, I don't know all of your work, but I do know you've got to be the best here or you wouldn't be working with me on this account.
DAVID=>Brad, shut up! Don't talk! This is my day. Paul, look what you're doing. I've been with this company a very, very long time. I'm one of the oldest employees on this coast, aren't I? Now, I must get what I deserve. I will be made vice president and I will get the stock and I will participate in the ownership of the company and that's that.
PAUL=>My God, I thought you'd be thrilled.
DAVID=>You thought I'd be thrilled? I can't believe it. Why the hell don't you go to New York? If it's so thrilling, come on, I'll take you to the airport. I'll put you on a plane right now.
PAUL=>Don't talk to me like that. I came from New York.
DAVID=>Yeah, that's right and you don't want to go back because as soon as you land at the airport, people steal everything you've got.
BRAD=>I resent that. That's a cliché. New York's the greatest city there is.
DAVID=>Sit down. Just sit down and shut up.
PAUL=>David, that's enough.
DAVID=>No. I haven't even started yet. Now listen, let's say a giant mistake was made. Pretend none of this was ever said. I'm the vice president. Everything will be fine. I'll stay here. I'll work on Ford. I'll move into my new house. You and Brad can come over for drinks. And now, let's bring out Allen Funt and everybody will yell, "Surprise," right? I'm vice president, right?
PAUL=>David, the position is filled.
DAVID=>Well, then you can go fuck yourself!
BRAD=>Paul, I can't work with this man.
PAUL=>I can't either. David, you're fired.
DAVID=>Fired! How dare you? I can't believe this! You want to know something? I was nervous about coming in here today. I said to my friends, "Maybe I won't get this." You know what everyone of them said? "Stop it. You're being stupid. You're the best man. There's no one else. You're the best man." And what does the best man do? He stands next to the groom and watches the groom become vice president!
PAUL=>I can see you're upset. I'll forget what you said earlier. I don't think you want to jeopardize eight years with this company.
DAVID=>Fuck you!
PAUL=>That's it. Get out.
DAVID=>I wasted my youth for you and for what? What do you mean jeopardize eight years? What eight years? All I did was live for the future. Why didn't you tell me a long time ago that I was too clever? You should have told me five years ago, then I could've gone somewhere else.
PAUL=>I didn't know it five years ago.
DAVID=>Don't say anything else. I'll kill you.
PAUL=>Get me security, please.
DAVID=>Oh, I can't believe it. Security. Okay, listen to me. I want my eight years back! Give me my life back! I want my eight years back! Give them to me!
BRAD=>I'm going back to the hotel. David, you're making a big mistake.
DAVID=>You don't even know me, you baldheaded fart!
DAVID=>I can't believe that I almost wasted my entire life here! I've been waiting very, very patiently and I realize now what would've happened. This would've gone on for years and years and years and when I was seventy, I would've gotten a watch. Actually you wouldn't even have given me a watch. You would've told me I was too clever, that I would instinctively know the time. You know something, Paul? I made fun of my friends who dropped out of college and went to "find themselves." I told them they were stupid. I laughed at them. And what did I do? I went with you. Good choice, wasn't it? What did I get for doing that? A transfer. I could've gotten that from a bus. You're a human bus, Jesus Christ! You liar! I don't know where those drop-outs are today, but I've got to find them! I owe them a big apology. 'Cause let me tell you something. They have more integrity on their little tab of acid than you have in your entire body, you big fucking jerk!
PAUL=>Would you escort Mr. Howard out, please?
DAVID=>He doesn't have to escort me out. I'm honored to leave.
DAVID=>Before I leave, I think it's very important for everyone in this company to know what went on in here today. I don't know how many lunches you've all had with that man and I don't know what he's said over salad or dessert or whatever he buys you, but you better not believe it! He's a real smoothie! He'll tell you about the stepping stones! That's his favorite expression. He'll tell you about the stepping stones and where they lead. Well, I found out where they lead! To a baldheaded fat man in New York! Get out! Get out now! Smell the roses! Smell anything! Just smell! Smell before it's too late!!
DAVID=>Nancy!
NANCY=>God, you scared me.
DAVID=>Nancy, come here. Quit. Quit, right now. We're getting out.
NANCY=>What?
DAVID=>Now. Quit.
NANCY=>Quit?
DAVID=>Now. Come on. I did. Now, you do it.
NANCY=>You did? You quit your job?
DAVID=>Surprised, aren't you? You wouldn't have believed me. You would've loved it. No more me. No more waiting. No more responsible David. Jesus, they were leading me down a dead-end street! I've been on the wrong road. I realize what you meant. I've been too responsible. So responsible, God! I've been responsibly blind!
NANCY=>I never would've used the word responsible if I thought you would have taken it so literally. It was just a word. I really didn't mean anything by it.
DAVID=>Stop. Don't do this. Don't. I'm giving you the credit. You did mean it and you were right. I don't know where the hell I've been for the last ten years. What happened to me? I lost the feeling of life. Jesus, I was being jacked off. Nancy, they were just jacking me off!
NANCY=>Honey, shh. A little lower, please?
DAVID=>Okay. They were jacking me off. They were leading me down this road. You know, this road?
NANCY=>What road?
DAVID=>The road to nowhere. You know the road. The Nowhere Road. I was being tugged along with this carrot. "Come here. Come here. Come here." But no one told me it was a fucking cul-de-sac! We've been on the wrong road.
NANCY=>Who was made vice president?
DAVID=>Oh, Nancy, that's all over now. That's kid's stuff. Vice President. Class Secretary. Cloakroom Monitor. Treasurer. They're all stupid. If you really want to know who it was, it was Phil Shubano.
NANCY=>No! Why?
DAVID=>We'll never know. The Lord works in mysterious ways, but if there is a God, you know what will happen to Phil? He'll get his profit sharing and he'll buy a boat with it and he'll crash the boat and die.
NANCY=>Stop it. You like Phil. You don't mean that.
DAVID=>Of course I like him, the under- qualified son-of-a-bitch. Okay, I was harsh. He'll crash the boat. He'll have a serious injury but he'll recover. But forget about Phil! Forget about the vice presidency! That's the past. Nancy, it's time to do it. We're still young. We can change courses. We can do what we should've done years ago, what our smart friends did. We can get out there. We can get out and see this country. We can find out what it's about. We can touch Indians. We can live in the mountains. We can do anything we want to do. And we're still young enough to really explore. So come on, let's go. We're late. I'll wait here. Go quit. Come on. We're leaving.
NANCY=>I can't just quit right now.
DAVID=>Oh, God, I want to fuck you. Come on. Let's fuck, right here.
NANCY=>We can do it later. There's a lot of people around now.
DAVID=>There's always going to be people around. That was the problem. We lived for them, not for us. It's okay. There are some people you want to fuck in front of and some people you don't. Maybe you don't want to fuck in front of these people, I don't mind. I'll be outside. You quit. I'll wait!
NANCY=>I can't quit now, even if I want to. There is no one I can quit to. My boss is not here. We'll talk more about it tonight, please?
DAVID=>Okay, but we're saved. Honey, we're saved. Somebody up there likes us. I don't know who it is, but we're going to find them. We'll find everybody who likes us. We'll start finding people who understand what life is all about. We'll find people who are really searching. We'll find people who are willing to take a chance. Look, I'll just get all excited and get into it all again. You go and finish what you have to do and then I'll see you tonight.
NANCY=>Look at this. This is the cutest farmhouse I've ever seen. Twenty- four acres near Darien, Connecticut, five bedrooms, eighty thousand dollars? How could that be?
DAVID=>Because it's there. It's not here. We're used to this city. You know what our new house would cost, if it were where this farmhouse was? Not four hundred thousand, maybe sixty thousand if we were lucky.
NANCY=>My God. Look at this. A converted lighthouse in Maine, fifty-five thousand, two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a playroom. How do you put this into a lighthouse?
DAVID=>Well, maybe you go to Maine and find out. Or you don't. You do anything you want. Nancy, look at this...
DAVID=>This seems to make sense to me. You tell me what you think. The one good thing about spending all this time in Los Angeles was that we got a free ride on this bullshit inflation train. Don't ask me how it happened, but we made a hundred and ninety thousand dollar profit by staying in this house for less than five years. Now, that was money we were never going to see 'cause we were about to put it back into another stupid house. Okay. We pull out of that house, we lose our fifteen thousand dollars in Escrow, we take the money from this house, we liquidate everything else we have, cars, stocks, bonds, everything... Nancy, we have two hundred thousand dollars!
NANCY=>We couldn't.
DAVID=>We do.
DAVID=>All we need to buy is a motor home and we should get a great one because we might live there for the rest of our lives, or for five years or ten years or whatever.
NANCY=>What do you think a motor home costs?
DAVID=>Guess who went motor home shopping? We can get a great one for twenty- five thousand dollars. If there's one thing you can get a deal on it's a motor home. This is the best time in history to drop out. It's a buyer's market!
NANCY=>So that would leave us a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. I can't believe it!
DAVID=>Yes! On that kind of money we could ramble across the country for years! We can paint, we can explore, we can meet amazing people.
NANCY=>And if we get to Connecticut and we like one of these farmhouses, we'd have enough money to put a down payment on it, wouldn't we?
DAVID=>Yes! Then if we get sick of that we could sell it and move on.
NANCY=>I'd like to go to Alaska.
DAVID=>Great! Alaska's great! We can do anything we want.
NANCY=>This is what we talked about when we were nineteen!
DAVID=>Yes. We talked about finding ourselves but we laughed it off because we had no money. Now we can do it in comfort. We've got our nest egg. This is a dream come true.
DAVID=>What's wrong? Are you okay?
NANCY=>We really can do whatever we want to, can't we?
DAVID=>Who's stopping us?
NANCY=>Nobody's stopping us!
PATTY=>You look very happy. You look so good. I'm happy for you.
NANCY=>I know you are.
JACK MARTIN=>Well, well.
NANCY=>I didn't know you were going to come.
JACK MARTIN=>One employee we are certainly going to miss.
CAROL=>I think it sounds wonderful.
JIM=>You were great. Man, it was great. It was like "Network" and "Take This Job and Shove It," all rolled into one. When you left, we all wanted to go with you. Really. People really had to think for a minute. They were ready to leave.
DAVID=>Did anyone else leave?
JIM=>No. I mean after a few minutes, people just went back to work, but for the moment, it was real exciting.
DAVID=>Well, when the time's right, if people want to leave, they will.
JIM=>Of course. I believe that. I got to be honest with you, though. I was thinking about my situation and I don't think I have the guts.
DAVID=>I don't know that it's guts. It just takes a certain kind of person.
JIM=>Yeah, maybe it has nothing to do with guts. 'Cause I think I have guts. I guess I'm not that kind of person. Let's say that I like expensive things and I guess I need my job to get what I like.
DAVID=>Whatever makes you happy.
JIM=>Right. I guess expensive things make me happy. These shoes make me happy. Do you like them?
DAVID=>Beauties. What are they? Bally's?
JIM=>A Bally copy. Bally's would be three hundred bucks. These were a hundred and eighty. Can't tell the difference. The sole's just as thick. Look, feel the sole.
DAVID=>No, I don't know where you've been, Jim. I don't want to touch your shoe. They're beautiful. Good thick sole.
NANCY=>Honey?
DAVID=>Hello, Jack. How are you?
JACK=>Daniel Boone, as I live and breathe. Dan, you know my wife, Carol.
DAVID=>Hi, Carol.
JACK=>So, Mr. Boone, you leave in the morning, uh?
DAVID=>Let's call me David from now on. Just for old times sake.
JACK=>Oh, come on, I'm just playing with you. Listen, I'll tell you something. What you and your wife are doing, well, it's wonderful. Carol and I were driving over here tonight, and talking seriously about breaking the mold ourselves.
DAVID=>Really?
JACK=>You bet. We haven't been that happy lately. Have we, honey?
JACK=>I told her, if I can get some time off, we're going to try to get down to La Costa for a weekend and just let it all out.
DAVID=>La Costa? For a whole weekend, huh? That's great.
JACK=>That's if I can get away. If not, at least for an afternoon. Just the idea of getting to San Diego, maybe take in Sea World. Anyway, did Nancy tell you what Robinson's plans to do?
DAVID=>Actually we haven't talked too much about American business lately.
JACK=>Well, there is a rumor and I would appreciate you not telling anyone this, but our store may just be buying up the May Company. This is just the kind of expansion that can make a man like me very, very wealthy.
DAVID=>Well, if it's good for you, I'm real happy.
JACK=>Well, let's just say it could make me a million dollars, minimum. But, David, please keep this down. God, I probably shouldn't have said anything.
DAVID=>Jack, we're not going to be around people who will care. I promise you. I don't think a guide at the Grand Canyon knows or cares too much about the acquisition of a department store in L.A.
JACK=>You want a surprise? You want to know about the Grand Canyon and business? The 7-Eleven at the Grand Canyon does more volume business per year than any other 7-Eleven in the country, especially around Muscular Dystrophy time.
DAVID=>Well, that's good to know.
JACK=>I think it has something to do with the hiking and the tragedy of the children who can't hike. I don't know, but last year they did two million, eight-hundred thousand. Now, of course, there are no other quickie stores around so they have a good one there. A lot of people moving in and out of that canyon. Have you seen these new U-Tote-M stores?
DAVID=>Jack, I don't want to be rude but I can't talk business anymore. I hate to sound "sixties" to you but I'm in a different place.
JACK=>Hey, I understand. I remember the sixties. As a matter of fact, the concept of U-Tote-M is a sixties concept. See, the 7-Eleven is a rush-rush place. U-Tote-M is lay-back. Their store in Tarzana this year is going to gross almost...
DAVID=>Jack, please?
PETE=>I'd like to make a toast.
PETE=>To our beautiful friends, David and Nancy Howard... Good luck!
DAVID=>That's it, huh? What a well thought out toast. Thank you, Pete.
DAVID=>Well, I think it's time for me to say something right now.
DAVID=>Sweetheart, would you come here?
DAVID=>I have a surprise for my wife and I would like to share it, not only with her, but with you, who we consider our closest friends. We do have some other close friends. I'm sure they got lost.
DAVID=>When Nancy and I were married we had dreams and plans and I guess in the pursuit of those things, we kind of lost each other. Tomorrow morning, when we leave here, we have no destination. Our only goal is to find out who we really are and what it is that's really out there. We're going to be adventurers in the classic sense of the word, but there is one place that we will stop at first. That place is Las Vegas, Nevada.
NANCY=>Las Vegas? Really?
DAVID=>Well, if this is to be a new beginning, I think there's only one way to really show it to this woman that I love. So, tomorrow evening my wife and I are going to be remarried.
NANCY=>Oh, my God! Oh! My!
NANCY=>This is the most beautiful thing you've ever done.
DAVID=>Well, I'd like to say it was nothing, but that small little ruby cost a fortune.
DAVID=>That's okay, it's budgeted for.
DAVID=>And now, I would like to propose a toast.
DAVID=>To you, our loyal friends, we will miss you. To my lovely new bride, I want to know you all over again... And to America, get ready. Here we come!
DAVID=>Honey, we're two minutes from crossing the city limits. Come up front. This is historic.
NANCY=>Just a second! This microwave oven browns, did you know that? The one in our new house couldn't even do that.
DAVID=>Our new house? No, some poor sucker's new house. This is our new house and I love it.
DAVID=>Boy, does this smell good. How long did it take to melt this?
NANCY=>Twenty seconds.
DAVID=>Can you believe it? Boy! I never really tasted melted cheese on toast before. I must have eaten it a million times, but this is the first time I've really tasted it. It's good and I bet it gets better the further we get from L.A.
NANCY=>We'll actually be breathing clean air. We haven't done that for -- how many years?
DAVID=>Forever. I hope we can recognize it.
NANCY=>Last night was so nice, don't you think? Those are good people. We had good friends there.
DAVID=>I know. It's just that we weren't good friends there.
NANCY=>Every once in a while I can't believe what we're doing. Are you scared? Be honest.
DAVID=>No, not at all. Well, let's say I'm scared in the same way Columbus was scared.
NANCY=>Columbus must have really been scared, huh? That took a lot of guts, didn't it? What if the world was flat? They really didn't know anything.
DAVID=>Well, I think he covered himself.
NANCY=>How?
DAVID=>Oh, let's say there was the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa Maria. I'd bet everything I have that Columbus was in the Santa Maria. If the world was flat, I think he'd watch the Pinta and the Nina go. Then he'd tell the Santa Maria to turn around. He'd probably just go back and have sex with the Queen again. I don't think he was a complete schmuck.
NANCY=>So, actually, we're braver than Columbus. We don't have two motor homes in front of us.
DAVID=>That's right. However, we should keep our eye on that Buick ahead. If it falls off the earth, it would be wise to pull over and re- evaluate.
DAVID=>Doesn't it look beautiful? I'm excited. Let me find out what we do. I'll get all the information.
NANCY=>Wait a second.
DAVID=>What?
NANCY=>Aren't you tired?
DAVID=>I'm excited.
NANCY=>You know what we should do? We should get married tomorrow.
DAVID=>Why? We should get married now and then drive out to the Grand Canyon and have our second honeymoon under the stars. What could be better than that?
NANCY=>Well, here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to get married in the morning. We're trying to start a new life. We should do it at the beginning of a new day. We'll both be fresh. We'll be up. We can get married at the crack of dawn.
DAVID=>That sounds nice. Alright. We'll camp out some place tonight and then come back before dawn. As a matter-of-fact, these places will be less crowded then. Good idea. Nancy, you're a genius.
NANCY=>Are we sure we want to camp out tonight?
DAVID=>What?
NANCY=>Why don't we make tonight a real old-fashioned honeymoon? Let's go to the best hotel and get the honeymoon suite and celebrate our heads off.
DAVID=>Sweetheart, we don't want to stay in a Vegas hotel. This is what we've left, this money-grabbing, horrible society.
NANCY=>I agree, but one night? We'll have room service and make love in a big bed and watch porno movies. I think it'll be fun.
DAVID=>We want to touch Indians.
NANCY=>We will. Just tonight and then that's it. Don't you want to take a bath together in one of those big tubs?
DAVID=>Well, okay.
NANCY=>If you really don't want to, we don't have to. We can camp out.
DAVID=>No, it's okay. As a matter-of-fact, it might be very exciting. We haven't been in a bath together for a long time.
DAVID=>I don't think they know how to drive those things. He could ruin it.
NANCY=>Oh, don't worry. They can drive anything. Look. Isn't this wonderful? It's so romantic. God, I used to come here a lot. I kind of miss it.
DAVID=>You never told me you came here. When?
NANCY=>Before we were married. I'll tell you about it later. Come on.
CLERK=>Excuse me?
DAVID=>My wife and I have dropped out of society and we're making this statement, but we want to spend one last night here. We're planning to get up at the crack of dawn and get remarried and...
NANCY=>Just ask him for the room.
DAVID=>I'm getting to it. I know what I'm doing. Anyway, we're going to get up very early and get remarried so we want something very special because we're doing something special. My point is, we'd like your finest bridal suite.
CLERK=>Do you have a reservation?
DAVID=>No, I told you, we just dropped out. We don't do reservation things anymore. We're living spontaneously.
CLERK=>Well, we're not. We thrive on reservations and I'm sorry but the bridal suite is occupied.
DAVID=>What other rooms do you have?
NANCY=>Just a minute, please? The bridal suite isn't occupied.
DAVID=>What?
NANCY=>It's not occupied. I can see it in his face.
DAVID=>What do you mean?
NANCY=>Give him money.
DAVID=>What?
NANCY=>Give him fifty bucks.
DAVID=>Why?
NANCY=>We'll get the bridal suite.
DAVID=>How do you know?
NANCY=>Trust me.
DAVID=>Hello, again. Do me a favor? I've worked with computers. I know what can happen. Sometimes these things get fouled up. Would you check one more time? Maybe the bridal suite was empty and the room next to it was occupied and the computer got mixed up.
CLERK=>I know what you mean. That can happen sometimes. Let me check. Nope. It's occupied. These are state-of-the-art computers. Very rarely do we have those kind of mistakes.
DAVID=>You're sure?
CLERK=>Yes. Says right here, "Bridal Suite full."
NANCY=>Give him more.
DAVID=>Jesus. Really?
DAVID=>Listen, I'm not very good at this. I don't get good seats in shows because of this problem. I don't get good tables in restaurants. I've really never been good at this particular kind of exchange of money so, how much do you want?
CLERK=>A hundred dollars.
DAVID=>Fine. Here you go. A hundred. Now, I assume we don't have to continue this computer talk again and say that it's working now and everything?
CLERK=>Here you are, eight-twenty.
DAVID=>Now, this is the best bridal suite?
CLERK=>Heart-shaped bed. Everything. You'll love it.
DAVID=>Thank you very much. I'm sure the hundred doesn't apply towards the room at all.
CLERK=>You're kidding, right?
DAVID=>Of course. I was kidding all along.
DAVID=>Tell me we didn't do the right thing, getting out of this horrible society? Jesus Christ, I told the guy we dropped out. Did that make any difference? No. I said we're making a statement. What did he do? Stare at me. I said we're getting remarried. What does he finally say? Give me more money. God! How does a guy like that even live?
NANCY=>Well, think of all the people checking in here. Everyone giving him a hundred dollars, he probably lives well.
DAVID=>No, I meant with himself. How does he... Never mind.
PORTER=>I'll go down and get your luggage for you. Where is it?
DAVID=>That's okay. It's locked in our house. I'll get it later. Thank you very much.
DAVID=>I haven't been here in years. I hope this is enough. If it isn't, take some from the clerk. I gave him a hundred.
NANCY=>So? What do you think?
DAVID=>I think if Liberace had children, this would be their room. Cute little hearts, aren't they?
NANCY=>We should ask for a bigger bed.
DAVID=>Let's hold onto the cash we have. I don't want any more favors. We can try and push these together.
DAVID=>Look, we can crawl over the ventricles when we want to have sex. It'll be exciting. Why don't you order something up, okay? Order up a great meal and some great champagne. I'll go run the bath.
NANCY=>How's the bath?
DAVID=>There's no bath in there, honey.
NANCY=>Come on.
DAVID=>I have no reason to lie to you. Go look for yourself. There's a very teeny, heart-shaped shower and a medium sized, heart- shaped sink. At best, we can wash our socks together.
NANCY=>Are you disappointed?
DAVID=>Not at all.
NANCY=>Maybe we shouldn't order room service. We should get dressed and go down and check out some of these restaurants. Hey, do you want to see a show?
DAVID=>I don't want to leave the room. I just want to be with you tonight, here. It's our honeymoon. We should order up like we planned and then we can figure out a way to make love. Somewhere in this room, there has to be space.
NANCY=>Okay. I'm going in to take a nice hot shower, okay?
DAVID=>Good. You get nice and sexy because when you come out, we'll pack and leave.
NANCY=>Come on. We're going to have fun.
DAVID=>I'm joking with you. Now, hurry up, I'm getting horny. When you come out, I'll be the naked one on the right heart. I might even be looking at myself in the mirror and masturbating. Although, I don't think I can see myself through all this gold flock.
DAVID=>Rise and shine, my darling wife. We're getting married this morning. We're...
DAVID=>Nancy? Honey?
DAVID=>Honey? Are you in there? Nancy?
DAVID=>Honey? Nancy? Are you at the ice machine?
WOMAN'S VOICE=>May I help you?
DAVID=>Yes. I'd like to page Nancy Howard, please.
WOMAN'S VOICE=>And where would she be? Do you have any idea?
DAVID=>Probably in the coffee shop.
MAN'S VOICE=>Hello?
DAVID=>Hi, honey. Had a sex change, huh? I think you picked up the wrong phone. I'm paging my wife.
MAN=>You're married to Nancy Howard?
DAVID=>Yes.
MAN=>Why don't you come down to the casino?
DAVID=>Why? Is there something wrong?
MAN=>Your wife has been gambling for quite some time and possibly, you should speak with her.
DAVID=>What do I have to say to her? Is she winning?
MAN=>Why don't you just come downstairs?
DAVID=>Oh my God!
GUARD=>I'm sorry, you can't come into the casino dressed like that.
DAVID=>What are you, crazy? I saw Electric Horseman. Animals rode through here. Excuse me.
DAVID=>Honey? What are you doing?
NANCY=>Eight! Big chips!
DAVID=>Honey?
NANCY=>Not now. Get away. Not now.
DAVID=>What's going on?
NANCY=>Stop it. Come on, eight! Come on, eight!
DEALER=>Sixteen.
NANCY=>Shit!
DAVID=>Honey, calm down. Sweetheart?
MAN=>Could I speak to you for a moment?
DAVID=>What is it?
MAN=>Your wife is very distraught. She's been gambling almost five hours and she has not been on a lucky streak. Now, it's not our place to stop her, but possibly, you should.
DAVID=>What do you mean she's not been on a lucky streak? She's losing?
MAN=>Well, why don't you talk to her?
DAVID=>Honey, I want to talk to you.
NANCY=>Get away! Once again! Give me eight!
NANCY=>Come on, baby. Come on, lucky baby. Baby, baby. Baby, baby.
DEALER=>Eight it is.
NANCY=>Yes! Great!
DAVID=>Hey, that is great. You're a winner. How much was that? How much did she win?
DEALER=>Sixty dollars.
DAVID=>Alright. Nothing wrong with that. What's wrong with that? Now, what does this man mean who says you weren't on a lucky streak?
NANCY=>I was down earlier. Just go away.
DAVID=>But you're up now, right?
NANCY=>I'm still down. Eight again! And make it happen for me!
DAVID=>Boy, she keeps betting eight, huh? How down is she exactly?
MAN=>Oh, she's very, very down. I don't know how much money you have, but on the average I'd say this is what we call "very down."
DAVID=>What do you mean? A thousand?
NANCY=>Dammit! That keeps coming up, that zero. Jesus Christ! Now, once again, eight! Come back, eight! Come back, eight!
DAVID=>Just a minute. Nancy, stop.
NANCY=>Please, David! Please! You're bringing me bad luck.
DAVID=>Well, according to some people here, I'm not bringing anything. You're already having bad luck.
NANCY=>It's changing! Now come on, eight! Eight's my mate! Take the bait, number eight.
DEALER=>Four.
NANCY=>See what you did? Bad luck! Get away, please.
DAVID=>This man over here says you're very down. What does he mean?
NANCY=>Fuck the man! I don't know who you're talking about. Try it again! Eight!
DAVID=>Nancy, stop betting eight. There's hundreds of numbers on this table. Why the hell do you keep betting eight? Now, how much have we lost?
NANCY=>Everything. Come on, eight.
DAVID=>What do you mean everything? Did you say everything?
NANCY=>Goddammit! Son-of-a-bitch! You can't get any closer to eight than nine.
DAVID=>Come over here. Come with me.
NANCY=>Eight again! One more time!
DAVID=>There's nothing on the board. You're not at the table. You haven't placed a bet. Stop yelling eight. He doesn't care anymore.
NANCY=>I gotta find some money. Please. I'm about to hit.
DAVID=>No, you're about to get hit. Come on. We have some serious talking to do.
WOMAN=>I won!! I won!!
NANCY=>Look. She won... I want to play!
DAVID=>It's too late. You chose the table. Let's get out of here.
DAVID=>Okay, talk. What's going on?
NANCY=>At two-thirty this morning, I was up three hundred thousand dollars.
DAVID=>Three hundred thousand dollars? That's a lot of money!
NANCY=>More chips than you've ever seen in your life. You wouldn't have believed it. They were all over the place.
DAVID=>But when I came downstairs they were all gone. You didn't have any.
NANCY=>Yes, but I can get them back.
DAVID=>Let's wait on that for just a second. So, everything is gone and I'm trying to figure out the word "everything." We had a little bit of cash with us and you lost that?
NANCY=>Yes.
DAVID=>So, what did you do? You got more cash?
NANCY=>Yes.
DAVID=>So, you wrote a check then?
NANCY=>Yes.
DAVID=>You started drawing cash from our nest egg?
NANCY=>Yes. Yes.
DAVID=>How much of the nest egg did you take? What's left?
NANCY=>Nothing.
DAVID=>Oh, my God. By "everything" you mean "nothing."
NANCY=>Yes.
DAVID=>You didn't lose a hundred and eighty thousand dollars?
NANCY=>Maybe. I don't know. Give or take a thousand.
DAVID=>Give or take a thousand? Give or take a thousand?
DAVID=>Oh my God! Oh my God! I understand what we mean now. I understand what we all mean. Oh my God! My God! My God!
DAVID=>Oh my God! Alright. Let's not panic.
DAVID=>Bellhop, please. Bellhop, in here, please. There's an emergency!
NANCY=>What's the matter?
DAVID=>Nothing. Just wait. Oh my God!
NANCY=>Sweetheart, there were these Persians around me, staring at all these chips that were on the table and I've never had that feeling before, the feeling that I was completely in control. I was the one. I didn't need anything. I didn't care. I didn't have any problems. Do you know that feeling?
DAVID=>Not now. I don't know that feeling now, no.
BELLHOP=>Yes, sir?
DAVID=>First of all, I was speaking to a gentleman in the casino who seemed to be in charge there. He's what?
BELLHOP=>The Pit Boss?
DAVID=>Yes. What's his name?
BELLHOP=>Mr. Shuster.
DAVID=>Fine. Does he have an office?
BELLHOP=>Yes, it's behind the front desk.
DAVID=>Fine. Alright. Now would you please do me a favor? My wife is tired and would you escort her to 820. Would you please sit with her, maybe she'll want to take a shower or whatever, and just don't leave the room. I'll be up in a little while. But please don't leave. I don't want her to be alone right now.
NANCY=>Why are you treating me like an animal?
DAVID=>I'll explain it to you later.
DAVID=>Just relax. Lie down, if you want. Have some water. I'll be up in a few minutes.
NANCY=>Stop talking to me this way.
DAVID=>I'm not talking to you in any particular way. I'm just trying to keep everything calm and I'm trying to remain calm. I'm also trying to think what I can do to help us out now. The man's name again? The Pit Boss?
BELLHOP=>Shuster.
DAVID=>Thank you.
NANCY=>David, I'm sorry.
DAVID=>Save it. Just go upstairs.
DAVID=>Mr. Shuster, the Pit Boss, may I speak to him, please?
CLERK=>I don't know if he's in. Just a moment.
CLERK=>Yes. There's a gentleman here to see you. What is your name?
DAVID=>I'm David Howard. He knows me, we spoke on the telephone. My wife was the one who was up for hours.
CLERK=>David Howard. Yes. Yes. He'll be right out.
SHUSTER=>Mr. Howard? Come on in.
DAVID=>First of all, let me say, I've heard a great deal about you.
SHUSTER=>What do you mean? From who? What did you hear?
DAVID=>Oh, I just meant I've heard wonderful things from everybody in general, from the whole hotel.
SHUSTER=>Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
DAVID=>No, thank you.
SHUSTER=>Is your wife feeling better?
DAVID=>Yes, she is.
SHUSTER=>So, what can I do for you?
DAVID=>I have a very interesting idea. I think you'll be taken by it.
DAVID=>I was a key executive with a major advertising agency - one of the biggest in the world.
SHUSTER=>Yes, right. So?
DAVID=>Well, I was the Idea Man there. So, when I say I have an interesting idea, I'm not speaking like any slob that walks in off the street.
SHUSTER=>Okay.
DAVID=>My wife and I, we dropped out of society. She had a very important position in a department store and again, I remind you that I was one of the highest executives in the world's largest advertising firm.
DAVID=>Anyway, we were going to find ourselves. Then, we thought, maybe we're too old, it's too late. We can't find ourselves, that's only for kids. And then we thought about it some more and it hit us. Wait a minute. Who's to say at what age you stop being a kid?
SHUSTER=>You gotta have some age. How else could a court separate rape from fun? In this state, it's eighteen, by the way.
DAVID=>Yes. But my point is we wanted to find ourselves and we did and we dropped out, just like they did in "Easy Rider."
SHUSTER=>Easy what?
DAVID=>The movie, "Easy Rider." Famous movie. Important movie.
SHUSTER=>Didn't see that, I'm sorry.
DAVID=>It's a classic. If it comes on cable here, see it. Anyway, we did something that no one has done for a long time. Maybe no one has ever done it because in the movie they were movie stars, so they didn't really do it, even though they portrayed people that did it.
SHUSTER=>I'm getting mixed up here. What is your point?
DAVID=>Well, we did it for real. We quit our jobs and we sold everything that we had. The only thing we own is our little motor home, which is parked outside. That's all we've got and we were going to spend years roaming around this beautiful country, but we knew we couldn't do it unless we had our little nest egg tucked away in the bank.
SHUSTER=>I'm going off duty in a few minutes. Now, your point is what?
DAVID=>I'm getting to it. Why did we come to Las Vegas? Because it was a new beginning and I wanted to remarry my lovely wife. That's nice, don't you think?
SHUSTER=>Very nice.
DAVID=>I wanted to get remarried but I wanted to spend our honeymoon in the Grand Canyon, places like we intend to spend the rest of our lives in, but my wife is very fond of your hotel and all of the employees and she said, "Oh, come on, let's spend our honeymoon here." And we did and the room was very lovely and everybody was very nice to us, but my wife lost the nest egg.
SHUSTER=>Mr. Howard, stop right here. I think I know what you're getting at. I realize you've lost a great deal here and I want you to know that your room and your meals are comped.
DAVID=>That's very nice but that's not exactly what I'm saying. I think I have a multi-million dollar idea. Now, you have to be very secretive about what I'm going to tell you because the other hotels, if they heard about it, well, they'll grab it in a minute.
DAVID=>I think, as an experiment, you give us back the money we lost.
SHUSTER=>I beg your pardon?
DAVID=>Well, imagine the publicity? I mean, the Hilton, for example, they have billboards all over L.A. where they put the faces of the winners of those slot machines. Now, those people win a couple hundred thousand dollars, but the hotel is getting millions of dollars of publicity with those billboards because people drive by and say, "Gee, the Hilton looks like a nice place. Look at those smiling people." So, what about a billboard with my wife and I on it and we would be smiling and there would be a saying, something like, "These people dropped out of society, they couldn't take it any longer, but they made a mistake. They lost their nest egg at The Desert Inn, but The Desert Inn gave it back." And maybe there could be some kind of a visual with you handing us an egg or something. Now I mean, I'm just formulating this now, as I'm talking, but you can imagine, when it's worked out how effective it could be.
SHUSTER=>That's wonderful. Well, Mr. Howard, nice to meet you.
DAVID=>What do you mean nice to meet me? You said this is wonderful.
SHUSTER=>We're kidding each other here, right? I gotta tell you, this is one of the best things I've ever heard. What's the board gonna say again? "Gamblers, come and get your money back." Great. That's great.
DAVID=>No. No. Wait... Not "Gamblers, get your money back." That's wrong. We're not gamblers. We're the few people in society that have tried to do something with our lives. See? We're drop- outs. We're finding ourselves. Someone's got to help the few people like us, because if they don't, nobody will ever drop out again. Nobody will ever have the courage to find themselves.
SHUSTER=>Well, I understand what you mean, but I don't think The Desert Inn can help find you. I'm sorry, but thank you for the idea and good night.
DAVID=>Listen, I've experienced this before. I've had clients that didn't understand the idea until they saw it on television and then they said, "My God! What a brilliant idea! Why didn't I understand this?" I might have used the wrong phrase. Okay, picture this: maybe, my wife and I will do a television commercial for you and there could be a jingle and it could go: "The Desert Inn has heart! The Desert Inn has heart! The Desert Inn has heart!" Something like that. See what I mean?
SHUSTER=>That's a nice jingle. Mr. Howard, let's assume you're serious here. What if this caught on? Could you imagine what would happen? Why, we would have to return everybody's losses. The casino would just crumble. We couldn't pay our bills. You know the casino accounts for a great deal of our profits.
DAVID=>I understand. Of course, you don't pay back everybody's losses. You make a distinct division between the bold, who are out there searching, and all the other schmucks, who come here to see Wayne Newton.
SHUSTER=>I see. Now, I like Wayne Newton. So, I fall into what category?
DAVID=>Oh, look, I picked a name out of a hat. I like Wayne Newton, too. I'm saying a schmuck, representing the gambler and a bold person, representing me and my wife and the one or two others that probably wouldn't come here anyway. You wouldn't have to do this more than once or twice, there's not too many bold people around. I think it was a mistake to use entertainers as the dividing line. We could find another system. Anyway, what do you say? We do need that nest egg back.
SHUSTER=>I say good luck to you and stay away from the tables next time.
DAVID=>Oh, that's for sure, but come on? Half the money, for courage?
SHUSTER=>Mr. Howard, nice to meet you. A pleasure.
DAVID=>Hold it. What about "Miracle on 34th Street?"
SHUSTER=>Christmas picture, right?
DAVID=>More than a Christmas picture. What happened there? Macy's didn't want to send their customers to Gimble's because the president of Macy's thought they would lose all of their customers and lose a tremendous amount of money and it would be taken wrong. But it wasn't taken wrong. What happened? Macy's did much better than they ever did before. And that's what would happen to you. The Desert Inn would do much, much better because you would get Gimble's business and the casino would be full.
SHUSTER=>Well, I'm not too familiar with that picture but didn't Macy's have Santa Claus to help them out? I mean, if they didn't have Santy Claus there, they might have done very badly.
DAVID=>Yes. I guess they did have Santy Claus. Well, thank you. Thank you. And just so I understand, we can t get any of our money back, right?
SHUSTER=>Well, not today, no. But if the policy ever changes, we'll write you. That's wonderful. Very good.
CLERK=>I think he likes you. He rarely laughs at anything.
NANCY=>I can't take this. Say something. Yell at me. Hit me. Drive off the road. Do anything. Just stop being so silent.
DAVID=>I have nothing to say.
NANCY=>I can't keep apologizing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I feel horrible. I would do anything to change it.
NANCY=>You're going to make yourself sick. It's unnatural. I understand. If I were you, I'd be furious. Don't hold it in. Go ahead.
DAVID=>I'm fine.
NANCY=>Obviously, I can't apologize anymore for what I did so we should talk about what we're going to do.
DAVID=>And what would that be?
NANCY=>Well, our dream is still the same. We just don't have any money.
NANCY=>And, also, we should stop saying we don't have any money. We do have some.
DAVID=>We have eight hundred and two dollars.
NANCY=>That's something.
DAVID=>It is something. Yes.
NANCY=>Well, look, I think we should try to make the rest of the day as pleasant as we can. Since we're heading towards Hoover Dam anyway, we should make that our destination for today. We can go there, look around, maybe have a picnic or something, and maybe just see the dam and just have a nice day outside. What do you think?
DAVID=>Is that what you'd like?
NANCY=>Maybe it would be fun.
DAVID=>Fine. Hoover Dam.
NANCY=>Look at this! Come here. God! Just think. Men built this!
DAVID=>Yes. Men did build this.
NANCY=>What about something to eat? Hungry?
DAVID=>No.
NANCY=>I'm starved.
DAVID=>I don't think you can eat now.
NANCY=>Why?
DAVID=>Because with the little bit of money that we have left, I think we have to sit down and make up a new budget. Until we do, maybe we shouldn't spend it all on cotton candy and other various knickknacks here at the dam.
NANCY=>Well, if that's your attitude, I think you should give me half the money and let me eat whatever I want and you can do what you want with your half. I think that's the fair thing.
DAVID=>The fair thing? The fair thing? That's it! You're right. I've been controlled! Boy, have I been controlled! I guess any doctor could have spotted it. I was about to die, I was so controlled. You took all the money we had!
DAVID=>You took our nest egg and you broke it up! You got yoke all over the casino! You got the white all over the coffee shop! You threw the shells in the parking lot! Fair? Fair?! Where was I when you were playing with the egg? Sleeping. Sleeping. Goddammit!
NANCY=>Good. Get it out.
DAVID=>Shut up! Don't talk to me like I'm an insane patient!
NANCY=>Let's just go back inside. You can yell at me. You should, I think it's right. I just don't want you to yell out here.
DAVID=>Out where? This is where we're going to have to live. Why not yell out here? We're going to have to do everything else out here. We'll be sleeping out here and eating out here and going to the bathroom out here! Get used to this cement, baby! This is it! Out here is it! We found ourselves! We found ourselves, alright! We found ourselves with eight hundred dollars in the middle of nowhere!
DAVID=>Where are you going?
NANCY=>I don't want to have an argument in front of those people.
DAVID=>Why not? I think those people are entitled to know how stupid you are.
NANCY=>This is going to turn into a personal attack, isn't it?
DAVID=>What else? A general attack? Who am I going to attack? Nevada? I can't attack the state. It wasn't their fault. I can't attack the motor home. It stayed in the parking lot. I can't attack me. I was fast asleep. By process of elimination, who's left?
NANCY=>I am. I'm left, okay? And I'll say it one more time - I'm sorry.
DAVID=>I don't want your apologies. I want to know why? I want to try to understand how it happened. Tell me. How did it happen?
NANCY=>I couldn't sleep.
DAVID=>You couldn't sleep. I see. Now, I remember nights where I couldn't sleep. I'm just trying to think what I did. Let's see. I tried warm milk or I took a long walk or I took Nytol and then, if all that didn't work, I gave away all the money I ever earned. But you didn't try any of those things first. You just gave away the money first, right? What did you intend to do? Have warm milk afterwards? Tell me. I'm mixed up.
NANCY=>You're not even listening.
DAVID=>I'm sorry. You're right. Go ahead. You couldn't sleep. Then what happened?
NANCY=>I don't remember. I just went downstairs.
DAVID=>Why didn't you wake me up?
NANCY=>What would you have done?
DAVID=>What would I have done? I would have followed you. I would've seen you. I would have watched you take your money and begin to lose it and I would have stopped you at thirty dollars, maybe thirty-two dollars, at the most. I would have said, "Sweetheart, come back to bed. We don't want to fool with our nest egg." You know, Nancy, I think you just considered nest egg to be a term but to me, it was a key to this whole experiment. Why, I considered it like a third person. It was our best friend, our guardian angel. It was going to allow us to do everything we wanted to do. It was going to watch over us during bad times and laugh with us during good times. It was going to help us roam and purchase and eat and explore. It was going to help us make love and laugh and cry and now, it's gone and who's got it? The Desert Inn! They've got our nest egg. They can sure use it, can't they? They don't have their own. They're a poor little organization. They need our nest egg. Gee, I hope they use it wisely. I know someday those mirrors are going to have to be reflocked and the red velvet was looking kind of worn. And those little heart beds are going to need new sheets. I'm glad we could help them pay for that. I'm glad our life savings will go towards making that room look a little prettier. I'm glad we gave it all to them, Nancy. I'm just going to miss the little nest egg, that's all. Won't you, sweetheart? Won't you miss the nest egg? In the middle of the night, won't you feel kind of lonely because little nest egg is paying for the gas in Frank Sinatra's limo?
NANCY=>Shut up, David! Shut up! I don't want to hear nest egg anymore! I don't want to hear that word. Let me tell you something. That's not the way you drop out anyway. If you're really going to drop out, you drop out with nothing!
DAVID=>You drop out with nothing? Oh where did you read that? In the Las Vegas Guide?
NANCY=>I didn't read that. I know that.
DAVID=>Oh, I see. Who told you?
NANCY=>Friends, people who know. I don't have to answer you.
DAVID=>No. You don't have to answer me. You can't answer me because no one ever told you that. You never had friends who dropped out. You don't know anybody who dropped out except for us. So how the hell did you know that? Come on, tell me?
NANCY=>Alright. The movie you're basing your whole life on, "Easy Rider," they dropped out with nothing. They had no nest egg.
DAVID=>Bullshit. They had a huge nest egg. They sold cocaine. They didn't get on their motorcycles till their nest egg was giant, fifty times the size of ours.
NANCY=>That's not true.
DAVID=>Oh, look. I'm not going to stand here, in front of one of the seven wonders of the world and argue about an old movie. I'm going to go now and get back in the motor home and maybe you can wander around out here and figure out something to do. We have eight hundred dollars left and an entire lifetime. See what you can come up with.
NANCY=>We could sell cocaine.
DAVID=>Well, my God. Why didn't I think of that? Great idea. As a matter- of-fact, I remember after seeing "Midnight Express" I went out of the theater saying to myself, "That's for me. Sex with hundreds of Turkish men."
DAVID=>Come on. Let's go.
NANCY=>No. Forget it.
DAVID=>Forget what?
NANCY=>Forget everything.
DAVID=>What are you talking about?
NANCY=>You know, I'll tell you one good thing that came out of all of this. We forgot to get remarried. That was one good thing that happened and no one has mentioned that yet.
DAVID=>What are you saying?
NANCY=>I'm saying that if we got remarried it would be much more difficult to get divorced. Now it's easy. It's over. I'll just stay in Nevada for six weeks and then we'll be legally through. This is how it should have happened anyway, David. We were stupid to think it could have happened any other way.
DAVID=>Do you really believe that?
NANCY=>You bet your life I do. I realize now, you're never going to let me forget this. For the rest of our lives, you'll blame me and I won't take it. So, goodbye. I'm sorry. It didn't work out.
DAVID=>What do you expect to do? Where do you think you're going?
NANCY=>I still have my dreams. I'll have to find somebody else who understands them a little bit better and then I'll start over.
DAVID=>Okay. Enough is enough. I understand your dreams. You said, "Explode." I exploded. It's done. Now, come on. Let's not act stupid. I'm over it.
NANCY=>You'll never be over it. I know you. You're right. I'm stupid. You don't want to be with a stupid person so leave me alone.
DAVID=>What are you doing?
NANCY=>None of your business. Now get out of here, please.
DAVID=>You told me to be angry. You said it was unhealthy not to be angry. You'd be angry, too. God knows you'd be angry.
DAVID=>Nancy, there's a car coming and there's a man in there who looks like an animal. Now if you don't put your thumb back, he's going to pick you up and if he picks you up, you're going to be in his car. I don t know him. You don't know him. We don't know where we are, so why don't we stop acting like this?!
NANCY=>Goodbye.
DAVID=>What is happening? You said it fifteen hundred times, "Get angry." I got angry. I thought I got angry well. I'm over it.
NANCY=>Sure you're over it. You're still yelling.
DAVID=>I'm yelling because you're about to get in someone else's car!
RED-NECK=>Where ya headin'?
NANCY=>With you.
RED-NECK=>Alright. You got it. Come on.
DAVID=>This has gotten out of hand. Look around you, Nancy, you're in another car! That man is not me! Nancy! I apologize! I'm sorry!
DAVID=>Listen to what I'm saying. I was sleeping and I'm yelling I'm sorry. What's going on? Jesus Christ! She's going to get killed!
DAVID=>I've lost my wife in the desert. This is just silly. You lose your wallet or your keys but I've lost a whole woman.
DAVID=>Nancy, I think we should go.
RED-NECK=>I don't think she wants to speak to you, buddy.
DAVID=>I've known her for a long time. I think I would rather have direct communication with her. Nancy, come on.
RED-NECK=>I said she don't want to talk to you.
DAVID=>We're leaving now, okay, honey?
RED-NECK=>You're not listenin', are you?
DAVID=>I'm listening. This is my wife. It's between her and me. Nancy? We're going to work things out now. Thank this gentleman for the ride and let's go.
RED-NECK=>Mister, I'm gonna count to three and I want you out of here. One...
DAVID=>Nancy, this man's counting. Who is he?
RED-NECK=>Two.
DAVID=>Honey, there's one number left.
RED-NECK=>Three.
RED-NECK=>Let's go. You and I, we have some fighting to do.
DAVID=>Is this what you want? Is this what was supposed to happen? I'm now going to be killed by a gorilla?
DAVID=>Call him off! He'll obey you! Tell him it's alright!
RED-NECK=>I hate you. I'm going to kill you.
NANCY=>It's okay. Stop. Please? Thank you for the ride but we can handle it.
RED-NECK=>You're out of this now. This is between him and me. I haven't hated somebody so much in a long time. He reminds me of everything I hate.
RED-NECK=>Come on. Come on. Let's really go at it.
DAVID=>This is going to disappoint you but I have really gone at it. I haven't had a fight since I was in the third grade. I'm just not used to it. Nancy, tell him.
NANCY=>Please! It's okay. My husband and I had a fight but we can handle it.
RED-NECK=>I said get out, lady. I'm on a mission now.
NANCY=>Help! Help! Police! Help! Murder! Help!
RED-NECK=>Well, look at this. A woman has to help you by yelling for the police. Well, if I wasn't wanted, I wouldn't care. I'd stay here and beat the shit out of you, but right now I can't afford to see the police. But I'll get you. I don't know where or when, but I'll get you, mister.
DAVID=>Yell "Police!" more. Keep yelling.
NANCY=>Police! Police!
DAVID=>More. Yell. Yell. Police! Help! Help!
RED-NECK=>I'll get you.
NANCY=>Are you alright?
DAVID=>That man will spend the rest of his life trying to find me. I'll be killed, Nancy.
NANCY=>Are you sure you're okay?
DAVID=>Yeah, I'm okay. Next time, if you're going to hitch, get a ride with a small woman, will you?
NANCY=>I'm proud of you.
DAVID=>For what? Getting beat up?
NANCY=>For rescuing me.
DAVID=>Well, I had no choice really. I thought about just forgetting it and finding someone new, but I realized I had nothing to offer them.
NANCY=>David, listen to me... We're going to be alright.
DAVID=>I hope so. Maybe we will.
NANCY=>What do you think we should do first?
DAVID=>First? First, I think we fill this thing with gas so we can get as far away as possible from that mental patient. Then, I guess we'll head east. We'll drive until we find a place we both like and that'll be our new home. We'll start there and we'll begin to rebuild.
NANCY=>I swear to God I think this is a blessing in disguise. The whole idea of going to Las Vegas was to get remarried so we could have a new beginning, right? Well, that would've just been a ceremony. Now, we really are starting from the beginning. I think this way is much better.
DAVID=>Well, I hope it is. But since we really will never know the other way, let's not compare.
NANCY=>But after all, the whole purpose was to find ourselves and to be free and now we really are free. The other way...
DAVID=>Hold it, honey. Another comparison, right?
NANCY=>Well, I'm just excited. I think this is a blessing.
DAVID=>It very well might be. All I'm saying is let's just let our original plan rest in peace.
DAVID=>Okay, so, gas and the payment here and the electricity hook-up, the water hook-up, lunch... Oh my!
NANCY=>What?
DAVID=>Three hundred and twenty dollars.
DAVID=>There it is, sweetheart. That's it.
NANCY=>Okay. Let's call this "emergency" money. We'll get jobs right away so we don't have to touch this.
DAVID=>Absolutely. This money we seal away.
NANCY=>We'll both have jobs by tomorrow. It's going to be good.
DAVID=>We have no choice. We have to have jobs by tomorrow.
NANCY=>We should celebrate tonight.
DAVID=>Celebrate what?
NANCY=>This! This is the real beginning!
NANCY=>What's the matter? What are you staring at?
DAVID=>Your legs. They look different.
NANCY=>Different?
DAVID=>They look longer.
NANCY=>You're joking, right?
DAVID=>No.
NANCY=>I have long legs, remember?
DAVID=>Remember what?
NANCY=>That was the first thing you ever said to me. You said I had sexy long legs. That was before you even asked me my name.
DAVID=>My God. You're right. We talked about your legs for a long time before your name came up. Was I rude?
NANCY=>You were great.
DAVID=>You didn't think I was so sexy the first time you saw me, did you?
NANCY=>Yes I did.
DAVID=>You didn't say anything.
NANCY=>Yes I did.
DAVID=>No you didn't.
NANCY=>Yes. I remember I told you I thought curly hair was very, very sexy. I said I liked your hair.
DAVID=>No, sweetheart, you said curly hair was sexy and then you asked me if that was my own hair.
NANCY=>Well, I was shy.
DAVID=>Don't worry. I took it as a compliment.
NANCY=>David, I love you. That was the best. It was amazing.
DAVID=>It never happened like that in L.A. I wonder why?
NANCY=>We stopped having sex in L.A.
DAVID=>That must be it.
NANCY=>Seriously. What do you really think happened? What did we do right?
DAVID=>I don't think it had anything to do with us.
NANCY=>What was it? The air?
DAVID=>Maybe. My guess is extreme poverty.
NANCY=>Well, then I say we should stay poor.
DAVID=>Look, I was just guessing. I think we have to make some money, we don't want to starve to death and then find out it really was the air. We'll feel so stupid.
NANCY=>I have so much energy. I can't wait to get out and just explore this city. I'm going to get a great job. I know it.
DAVID=>Me, too. Now, I think we should have some kind of a plan. What do you say we look for work together?
NANCY=>I don't think so. I think we should go in separate directions.
DAVID=>Why?
NANCY=>We'll cover more territory.
DAVID=>Alright. That sounds right. Good. Good idea.
NANCY=>Let's say we meet back here no later than five o'clock.
DAVID=>Five o'clock. Good.
NANCY=>I can't wait for five o'clock.
DAVID=>Good luck! Go for the high pay!
NANCY=>I know.
DAVID=>And buy a cheap lunch!
NANCY=>Don't worry.
DAVID=>I love you.
NANCY=>I love you, too.
DAVID=>I mean it! Cheap lunch!
DAVID=>Hello?
PHARMACIST=>Yes sir.
DAVID=>The delivery job, I'm interested in it.
PHARMACIST=>This is for your son?
DAVID=>No, for me.
PHARMACIST=>For you? Well, you have your own car? -
DAVID=>No.
PHARMACIST=>Gee, I'm sorry, but it's a delivery job. You would need a car.
DAVID=>Well, I have transportation. I own a motor home.
PHARMACIST=>A motor home?
DAVID=>Yes.
PHARMACIST=>I don't really think that would suit this particular job. I have just a few small deliveries a day. Those things aren't too efficient and you probably wouldn't be able to pay for gas with what I'd pay you.
DAVID=>Oh, I didn't know I'd have to pay for my own gas.
PHARMACIST=>Yes. Actually, my intention was to get a high school kid with a Rabbit or something. I think an older man with a motor home would be impractical for the both of us. You understand, I don't have that many deliveries. Also, you'd have trouble parking. I don't think this would work out.
DAVID=>I agree.
PHARMACIST=>You know what I should do? I should cross out "man" and put "boy," "delivery boy" is more correct. I guess "delivery man" is misleading.
DAVID=>No, the sign's alright. It looks fine. You don't know of any immensely high-paying jobs in the immediate area, do you?
PHARMACIST=>Um, let me think. No, not in the immediate area.
DAVID=>What about in the outlying areas?
PHARMACIST=>Uh, no. I don't know of any high- paying jobs anywhere in the whole country. Do you?
DAVID=>Um, no. Not now. Well, good day.
PHARMACIST=>Good day to you.
DAVID=>Is there an employment agency in this town?
PHARMACIST=>Yes. Just continue down this street about half a mile. It's a small building but you can't miss it.
AGENT=>So. What can we do for you?
DAVID=>Well, I'm originally from Los Angeles and I'm now living here. I need a job.
AGENT=>Alright.
AGENT=>What was your previous working experience?
DAVID=>Well, for the last eight years I was a major executive with one of the biggest advertising agencies in the country.
AGENT=>Oh, I see. And your previous salary?
DAVID=>Seventy thousand dollars.
AGENT=>You said seventy thousand?
DAVID=>Yes.
AGENT=>Over how long a period are we talking about?
DAVID=>A year. Seventy thousand a year.
DAVID=>What's so funny?
AGENT=>Nothing. That's very good. So, what brings you around these parts? Trying to double up that income?
DAVID=>No. I came here to live. I wanted to change my life.
AGENT=>You couldn't change your life on seventy thousand?
DAVID=>Could we just get back to what we're doing here?
AGENT=>Sure. Uh, I don't think I have anything at all right now. I mean the only thing I have, you wouldn't be interested in. Why don't you check back with me in a month?
DAVID=>Well, you don't know what I'd be interested in. Why don't you just tell me what you have?
AGENT=>I don't think that coming from your position and your salary you'd be interested in it.
DAVID=>Well, you don't know me. What is it?
AGENT=>It's a crossing guard.
DAVID=>A crossing guard? You mean at a school?
AGENT=>Yes. Where else do you see them work?
DAVID=>No, I just didn't know if there were different kinds. Well, what does that pay?
AGENT=>A hundred thousand dollars.
DAVID=>But, really, what does it pay?
AGENT=>It pays three twenty-five an hour, plus benefits.
DAVID=>Benefits meaning what?
AGENT=>Benefits meaning you can get a ride to and from work if you need it.
DAVID=>Well, listen, I've just started looking for work and I don't want to rule anything out but I think I probably can find something where I can use my ability a bit more. Would you have another kind of file, like an executive box or something?
AGENT=>What kind of box would that be?
DAVID=>You know, a box of higher-paying jobs.
AGENT=>My goodness, I forgot. Sure. You mean the hundred thousand dollar box?
DAVID=>Well, I'm happy I could provide you with your morning's entertainment. You can laugh at me but let me tell you something. I made a statement. You understand what I'm saying? I made a statement.
AGENT=>A statement?
DAVID=>Never mind. Thank you.
AGENT=>Thank you. Good luck.
NANCY=>Guess what?
DAVID=>A job?
NANCY=>Sure looks like it.
DAVID=>Fantastic! Tell me everything. What is it? How much do you get? When do you start?
NANCY=>I won't know anything for sure until tomorrow. I don't want to say anything until then.
DAVID=>Oh come on! Tell me? At least tell me what the job is.
NANCY=>Please. We'll get all excited and then what if I don't get it? Let's just wait.
DAVID=>Just give me a hint!
NANCY=>Well... alright. I would be an assistant manager.
DAVID=>Jesus! After one day? Assistant manager! Where?
NANCY=>That's all I'm saying. The manager's thinking it over. He said he'll let me know tomorrow. I don't want to jinx it. Now, come on. Let's hear about you. What happened?
DAVID=>Well, I'm not saying anything either, but I'll also know in the morning.
NANCY=>I gave you a hint, you have to give me one.
DAVID=>I can't. I have too many leads. I've had many firm offers and right now I'm just mulling them over.
NANCY=>What kind of offers?
DAVID=>Listen, I think you're right, we're going to jinx this thing. Let's just keep the mystery. It's more exciting that way.
MAN=>Now, this won't fit you exactly 'cause the fellow who had this before was about eighty and very heavy, but if you go up to the nurse's office they'll take it in.
DAVID=>Thank you.
MAN=>Now, I don't have the sign here, but do you understand? It's stop on one side...
DAVID=>Yes. Go on the other.
MAN=>No. If you're going to interrupt me I'm not going to be able to explain it. It's stop an one side and stop on the other. It's just a stop sign. So, when you want people to go you'll have to hide the sign.
DAVID=>That's right. I remember. You just put it down so people can't see.
MAN=>That's right. Behind your back is generally the best place.
DAVID=>Yes. I think, basically, this job hasn't changed since I went to school.
MAN=>Aren't you a little young for this kind of work?
DAVID=>I don't think so. Why?
MAN=>Well, all the other guards here have been in their late sixties or seventies. We had one who was fifty once but that's as young as I can remember.
DAVID=>Well, times are changing. I mean stereotypes have to be broken sometime, don't they?
MAN=>I guess they do. I never thought they did but yeah, I guess they do. Okay. Happy to have you here and I guess all you should know is that some of these children are rude.
DAVID=>Well, all children are rude.
MAN=>Well, these children are a little ruder than they used to be. You see we had this cutback in the school lunch program and sometimes they're hungry. And you know what happens when you're hungry? You get a little bit ornery. I guess what I'm saying is you'll need a little bit of tolerance.
DAVID=>Oh, tolerance is my middle name. Believe me.
DAVID=>Hello, children. How was school?
DAVID=>Ah. You must be two of the hungry ones.
DAVID=>Oh, my goodness. More hungry children. You want to cross the street?
DAVID=>My name is David. I would appreciate not being called that name. It's an ugly name.
DAVID=>I see no reason to walk future prisoners across the street. Why don't you get some practice working on your own right now since you'll probably be in solitary most of your life. You can handle it.
DAVID=>No, I can't take you across the street and, also, I'm allowed to make judgments. If I think someone shouldn't be allowed to cross the street I'm allowed to deny them that privilege. So, if you want to cross, you'll have to cross on your own.
DAVID=>What do you mean let's go? Is that a threat? Be careful. I've got a metal sign here.
DAVID=>Knife wins. Come on.
DRIVER=>Mister?
DAVID=>Call me David. I'm your age. I look a little older because I'm in this uniform.
DRIVER=>David, how do I get out of this place? Actually, what is this place?
DAVID=>What do you mean?
DRIVER=>What town is this?
DAVID=>Prescott.
DRIVER=>Jesus Christ. I'm lost. How do I get to Phoenix?
DAVID=>You have to get on Highway 90. So, what you do is go down about two miles, you'll come to a stoplight, you turn right and keep going and you'll see a sign.
DRIVER=>Two miles down and then right?
DAVID=>That's it.
DRIVER=>Thanks, man.
DAVID=>Hold it.
DRIVER=>What are you doing? Stop doing that. Get away.
DAVID=>I'm just smelling the interior. This is leather, isn't it?
DRIVER=>It's Mercedes Leather. They call it leather but it's vinyl. Smells like leather, though. Huh?
DAVID=>Yeah it does. You like this car?
DRIVER=>What's not to like? Hey, thanks, man. See ya.
DAVID=>It smelled like leather. They must spray it with something.
CHILD=>Hey, Retardo! Over here!
DAVID=>Without even looking I'm sure he means me.
DAVID=>Hi.
NANCY=>My God! You scared me.
NANCY=>You got your job?
DAVID=>Yes. Did you get yours?
NANCY=>Yes. Yes, I did.
DAVID=>Is that a uniform you're wearing?
NANCY=>Of course. What did you think, I bought this?
DAVID=>What do you do?
NANCY=>I work at Burger King. I got it. I'm the assistant manager.
DAVID=>Burger King?
NANCY=>The reason I wasn't sure last night was because the manager said he needed time to sleep on it, but this morning he told me he made his decision as soon as I left. He just didn't know how to get hold of me.
DAVID=>Hold it a second. Burger King? The hamburger place?
DAVID=>Nancy, who's this child?
NANCY=>Oh. This is Skip. He's the manager. He wanted to see where we live.
SKIP=>Hey, thanks, Nancy. Wow, this is like a real home. Now, when you flush the toilet, where does it go?
SKIP=>Oh, wow! Who's the crossing guard?
NANCY=>That's what you are! A crossing guard! I couldn't place it. That's wonderful! You're working with children!
DAVID=>I'm walking with children. There's a difference, but we'll talk about it later. Now, tell me again. This child is who?
NANCY=>This is Skip. He's the manager.
DAVID=>The manager? This is who slept on it?
SKIP=>Hey, it's nice to meet you. Call me Skippy, though, huh? That's what my friends call me. Hey, your wife's really something. Man, I think what you're both doing is amazing. She told me all about it. It's really great. You've got a lot of courage. It blew my mind. I'll tell ya, man, when I get old, I sure hope I drop out. It really sounds neat. Hey, did she tell ya what happened today?
NANCY=>David just got home, Skip. I'll tell him later.
DAVID=>No. Let Skippy tell it. I want to hear him talk some more.
SKIPPY=>Hey, thanks. Well, you know the fry machine? We were never using it right. See, no one ever told us. I mean we did everything the instructions said. You know, we put the oil in and everything, but we took the fries out, like, much too soon and no one knew. And your wife said, "Hey, these are frozen in the middle." And then we took them outside and we looked at 'em in the sun and she was right! They were still frozen. She spotted it on the first day! Do you believe it?
DAVID=>And how long were you making them the other way?
SKIPPY=>Oh, I don't know, a little less than a year.
DAVID=>Nancy, where are the keys?
NANCY=>They're in the ignition. Why?
NANCY=>You know I think Denver could be a good place to go.
DAVID=>Denver, huh?
NANCY=>Well, it's bigger. We do need a bigger city.
DAVID=>We certainly do. Sweetheart, let's talk for a second.
NANCY=>What?
DAVID=>I love you very much. You know that, don't you?
NANCY=>I love you, too.
DAVID=>Well, I think it's wonderful that we could say this and mean it. Do you know that ever since we were married I just was waiting for us to get divorced? I never thought we would make it, ever. But now I do.
NANCY=>I know. I feel the same way.
DAVID=>Well, my God, that's wonderful. I mean the experiences that we went through in the last two weeks, it did that. It showed us that we're going to be married forever. Nancy, we're together for the rest of our lives and I'm so grateful to finally have that peace of mind. It's wonderful.
NANCY=>I told you this would all be a blessing.
DAVID=>I know you did. But now, let's talk facts. Our nest egg broke. Forget who did it, no blame. That's not the point. The point is we didn't split up. We stayed together and decided to rebuild. And it was the best decision we ever made. Because for the first time we really know how to share. Whatever we have we can enjoy it together.
NANCY=>But we don't have anything.
DAVID=>There! Now we're getting to it. This afternoon I was guiding some children across the street and I realized something. Given our age, and the years we have left together, and the way we're going about this rebuilding program, we will never have another egg in our lifetime.
NANCY=>I was thinking the same thing.
DAVID=>Really?
NANCY=>Yes. As a matter-of-fact, I began thinking what we might do to speed things up.
DAVID=>That's amazing. So was I. Denver? Is that what Denver is about?
NANCY=>No. Not exactly. I was just kind of thinking of a general plan.
DAVID=>Me too.
NANCY=>Great. What?
DAVID=>Well, you tell me yours first.
NANCY=>No, you go first.
DAVID=>No. I'm almost embarrassed to tell you, mine's like a last resort.
NANCY=>Don't be embarrassed. What is it?
DAVID=>Well...
NANCY=>Come on.
DAVID=>Okay. I thought we'd just get to New York as fast as we can...
NANCY=>And you eat shit?
DAVID=>Your plan too, huh?
NANCY=>Exactly.
DAVID=>We really are a team.
NANCY=>We certainly are.
DAVID=>Brad, I made it! Three weeks on the button! Let's go to work. We got Fords to sell!
