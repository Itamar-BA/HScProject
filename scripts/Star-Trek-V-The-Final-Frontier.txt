RIDER=>I thought weapons were forbiddeen on this planet.
RIDER=>Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
J'ONN=>It's all I have.
RIDER=>Your pain runs deep.
J'ONN=>What do you know of my pain?
RIDER=>Let us explore it together.
RIDER=>Each man hides a secret pain. It must be exposed and reckoned with. It must be hauled from the darkness and forced into the light. Share your pain with me and gain strength from it.
J'ONN=>Where did you get this power?
RIDER=>The power was within you.
J'ONN=>I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
RIDER=>Join my quest.
J'ONN=>What is it you seek?
RIDER=>What you seek. What all men have sought since time began -- the ultimate knowledge. To find it, we'll need a starship.
J'ONN=>A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
RIDER=>Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
J'ONN=>But how?
RIDER=>Have faith my friend. There are more of us than you know.
J'ONN=>You're a Vulcan.
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK=>STARDATE 8454.011
SPOCK=>Greetings, Captain.
KIRK=>Spock -- what brings you to this neck of the woods?
KIRK=>I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
SPOCK=>I regret to inform you that the record time for free-climbing El Capitan is in no danger of being broken.
KIRK=>I'm not trying to break any records, Spock. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the lost important reason for climbing a mountain...
SPOCK=>Which is?
KIRK=>Because its there.
SPOCK=>Captain, I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
KIRK=>On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind, Spock. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr. McCoy for a while?
SPOCK=>Dr. McCoy is not in the best of moods.
SPOCK=>Concentration is vital. You must be one with the mountain.
KIRK=>Spock, I appreciate your concern but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one with the...
SPOCK=>Perhaps "because it is there" is not a sufficient reason for wanting to climb a mountain.
KIRK=>I'm hardly in a position to disagree.
KIRK=>Hello, Bones. Mind if we drop in for dinner?
SYBOK=>My friends, behold Paradise.
CAITHLIN=>Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.
TALBOT=>Ah, yes. Our new Romulan represent- ative. Welcome to Paradise City, Miss Dar, capital of the so-called "Planet of Galactic Peace." I'm St. John Talbot, the Federation representative here on Nimbus III and my charming companion is the Klingon consul Korrd...
CAITHLIN=>I expect that's Klingon for hello.
TALBOT=>He doesn't speak English.
CAITHLIN=>And I don't speak Klingon.
TALBOT=>I'm relieved to hear that. Please sit down Miss Dar. Can I offer you a drink?
CAITHLIN=>I must say I'm shocked at what I've seen. Hunger. Poverty. No law enforce- ment. And here the two of you sit drinking...
CAITHLIN=>What did he say?
TALBOT=>He says he hopes you'll enjoy your tour of duty here. Might I ask, Miss Dar, what terrible thing you did to get yourself banished to this armpit
CAITHLIN=>I volunteered.
TALBOT=>Volunteered.
CAITHLIN=>Nimbus III is a great experiment. Twenty years ago when our three governments agreed to develop this planet together, a new age was born.
TALBOT=>Your new age died a quick death. The great drought put an end to it. And the settlers we conned into coming here -- the dregs of the galaxy. They immediately took to fighting amongst themselves. We forbade them weapons -- they fashioned their own.
CAITHLIN=>Then it appears I've arrived just in time. The policies that the three of us agree on will have far-reaching results...
TALBOT=>My dear girl, we're not here to agree. We're here to disagree. This "great experiment" as you call it was instigated to satisfy a bunch of bleeding hearts whining for "galactic peace." It was intended to fail.
CAITHLIN=>I'm afraid I don't share that view.
TALBOT=>There, you see? We are disagreeing already.
CAITHLIN=>I'm here to open discussions for a solution to these problems.
CAITHLIN=>What did he say? I want his exact words.
TALBOT=>He said the only thing he'd like to open is your blouse. He's heard Romulan women are different.
CAITHLIN=>You tell Consul Korrd -- never mind. I'll tell him myself in the only Klingon I know.
KORRD=>Screw you too!
CAITHLIN=>He does speak English!
TALBOT=>Sly old bugger!
J'ONN=>Get away from that screen!
SYBOK=>Romulan. Terran. Klingon. Consider yourselves my prisoners.
TALBOT=>Prisoners. We're already prisoners on this worthless ball of rock. Of what possible value could we be to you?
SYBOK=>Nimbus III may be a wonderous ball of rock, but it does have one unique treasure. It's the only place in the entire galaxy that has the three of you.
CAITHLIN=>I don't know who you are or what you want but I can tell you this: our government will stop at nothing to insure our safety.
SYBOK=>That's exactly what I'm counting on.
UHURA=>I'm sure you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
SCOTTY=>Uhura, why aren't you on leave?
UHURA=>I thought we were going together.
SCOTTY=>I canna leave her when she needs me the most.
UHURA=>I had a feeling you'd say something like that. So... I brought you some dinner.
SCOTTY=>Lass, you're the most understanding woman I know.
COMPUTER VOICE=>Red alert. Red alert.
SCOTTY=>I just fixed that damn thing. Turn it off, will you?
UHURA=>This is Enterprise. Identify your-
COMMAND VOICE=>Enterprise, this is Starfleet. We have a Priority Seven situation in the Neutral Zone.
UHURA=>Stand by, Starfleet. Scotty, it's for real.
SCOTTY=>You canna be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton crew on board.
UHURA=>Starfleet, are you aware of our current status?
COMMAND VOICE=>Current status understood. Stand by to copy operational orders and recall key personnel.
CHEKOV=>Admit it. We're lost.
SULU=>All right, we're lost. But we're making good time.
UHURA=>Commander Sulu, this is Enterprise. Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
CHEKOV=>Rescued at last.
UHURA=>Return to the prearranged coordin- ates for pickup.
CHEKOV=>Don't tell her you're lost. You'll never live it down.
UHURA=>Is there a problem, gentlemen?
SULU=>Er... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
CHEKOV=>And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the co-ordinates.
UHURA=>I'm sorry about your weather. My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
CHEKOV=>Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
UHURA=>Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's safe with me. I'll send the shuttle- craft to pick you up.
SULU=>Uhura, we owe you one. Sulu out.
SULU=>I should have gone to Yosemite with the Captain.
CHEKOV=>What's the difference? If you've seen one national park, you've seen them all.
KIRK=>Knock it off, Bones. We're right here and we're starving.
SPOCK=>Bi-podal seeds, Doctor?
SPOCK=>In that case, I have little choice but to sample your... beans.
SPOCK=>Surprisingly good. However, it contains a flavoring I am not familiar with.
KIRK=>Got any more of that secret ingredient, Bones?
KIRK=>Bourbon and beans. An explosive combin- ation. Do you think Spock can handle it?
SPOCK=>As you are so fond of pointing out, Doctor, I am half human.
SPOCK=>Thank you.
KIRK=>What did I do?
KIRK=>It crossed my mind.
KIRK=>Even as I fell, I knew I wouldn't die.
KIRK=>It's not that, Bones. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
SPOCK=>I do not understand.
KIRK=>I've always known I'll die alone.
KIRK=>Other people, Bones. Not us.
KIRK=>What are you doing, Spock?
SPOCK=>I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
SPOCK=>Before leaving the ship I consulted the library computer to familiarize myself with the customs of "camping out." The evening meal is tradition- ally followed by the toasting of marsh melons.
SPOCK=>We consume them.
SPOCK=>I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the sing-a-long.
KIRK=>I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What should we sing? Bones?
KIRK=>"Pack Up Your Troubles."
SPOCK=>Are we leaving, Captain?
SPOCK=>Ah.
KIRK=>"Moon Over Rigel Seven?"
KIRK=>Excellent. Do you know it, Spock?
SPOCK=>I did not encounter that song in my research.
KIRK=>The lyrics are simple: "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream...merrily,merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream." Bones and I will start it off and when we give you the signal, jump in. Doctor if you please...
KIRK=>What's wrong, Spock? Why didn't you join in?
SPOCK=>I was trying to comprehend the mean- ing of the words.
SPOCK=>I am sorry, Doctor. We're we having a good time?
KIRK=>Why don't we call it a night and get some sleep? I'm anxious to have another go at El Cap in the morning.
SPOCK=>Captain?
KIRK=>We're on leave. Call me Jim.
SPOCK=>Jim?
KIRK=>Yes, Spock?
SPOCK=>LIfe is not a dream.
KIRK=>Go to sleep, Spock.

UHURA=>Mister Scott appologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft but the transporter beam is not operational. Captain, we've recieved important orders from Starfleet.
UHURA=>You forgot to take it with you.
KIRK=>Wonder why I did that? Well. gentlemen, it appears shore leave's been cancelled. Pack out your trash.
KIRK=>"... and all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer by."
SPOCK=>John Masefield.
SPOCK=>I am well-versed in the classics, Dr.
UHURA'S VOICE=>Ready for landing maneuver. Enterprise, you have control.
SULU'S VOICE=>Roger, Galileo 5. Open by door. Trans- fer power to the tractor beam.
KIRK=>You told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks. I gave you three. What happened?
SCOTTY=>I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
KIRK=>Very well, Mister Scott. Carry on.
SCOTTY=>Aye, sir. No rest for the weary. How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
ELEVATOR VOICE=>Level please.
KIRK=>Bridge, I hope.
KIRK=>I could use a shower.
SPOCK=>Yes.
KIRK=>Doesn't anything work on this ship?
YEOMAN=>Captain on the Bridge.
UHURA=>Ready for Starfleet transmission.
KIRK=>Could we have a little quiet, please? Thank you. On screen, Commander.
KIRK=>Bob?
COMMANDER=>Enterprise, this is Starfleet Oper- ations. Jim...? You're dressing rather informally, I see.
KIRK=>You caught me on my way to the shower.
COMMANDER=>Understand, sorry to interrupt your shore leave but look, we've got a dangerous situation on Nimbus III.
KIRK=>On "the planet of Galactic Peace?"
COMMANDER=>The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has capturted the only settlement and taken hostages of the Klingon, Romulan and Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise isn't completely up to specs...
KIRK=>Will all respect, Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant...
COMMANDER=>Other ships, no experienced command- ers. Captain... I need Jim Kirk.
KIRK=>Go ahead, Bob.
COMMANDER=>Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situatino, and avoid confrontation if possible. But, above
KIRK=>Have the Klingons responded?
COMMANDER=>No, but you can bet they will.
KIRK=>I'm afraid the ship's problems will have to be solved en route. Since we're undermanned, I'm counting on each of you to give his best. End of speech, let's get to work. Mister Sulu, plot course to Nimbus III.
SULU=>Aye, sir. Plotted.
KIRK=>The feeling's mutual. Engine room.
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Scotty here.
KIRK=>We'll need all the power you can muster, Mister.
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Dinna you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
KIRK=>I'll keep your offer in mind, Mister Scott. Best speed, Mister Sulu.
KIRK=>I miss my old chair.

KIRK'S VOICE=>Captain's Log, Stardate Eighty Four -- Try again, Captain's Log, Stardate Eighty -- Forget it.
UHURA=>Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
KIRK=>On screen.
KIRK=>Not General Korrd.
SPOCK=>The same. He has apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command. His appointment to Nimbus III appears to be a form of banishment.
KIRK=>Korrd's military strategies were re- quired learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
SPOCK=>Their weapons appear to be extremely primitive.
CAITHLIN=>At fourteen hundred hours we willingly surrendered ourselves to the forces of the Galactic Army of the Light. At this moment, we are in their protective custody. Their leader assures us that we will be treateds humanely as long as you co-operate with his demands. I believe his sincerity. He requests that you send a Federation starship to
CAITHLIN=>... and would appreciate your immediate response.
SYBOK=>I deeply regret this desperate act but these are desperate times. I have no desire to harm these innocents but do not put me to the test. I implore you to respond within twenty-four hours.
KIRK=>What is it, Spock? You look like you've just seen a ghost.
SPOCK=>Captain... perhaps I have.
VOICE=>I will find Sha Ka Ree...
KIRK=>Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
SPOCK=>I cannot be sure.
KIRK=>But he does seem familiar.
SPOCK=>He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
SPOCK=>I do not often think of the past.
KIRK=>Spock, who is it he reminds you of?
SPOCK=>There was a young student... except- ionally gifted... possessing great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
KIRK=>What do you mean?
SPOCK=>The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
KIRK=>Forbidden?
SPOCK=>He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
KIRK=>Why?
SPOCK=>He believed that the key to self- knowledge was emotion... not logic.
SPOCK=>When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
KIRK=>Fascinating.
UHURA'S VOICE=>Captain to the Bridge.
KIRK=>On my way.
KIRK=>Spock...?
SPOCK=>Coming, Captain.
SULU=>Approaching Nimbus III.
UHURA=>Hailing fequencies open.
KIRK=>Standard orbit, Mister Sulu.
UHURA=>Captain, we're receiving a transmis- sion from Paradise City. They demand to know our intentions.
KIRK=>Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. It wouldn't be far from the truth.
UHURA=>Paradise City, can you boost your power? We are barely receiving transmission.
KIRK=>Any sign of Klingon vessels?
SPOCK=>Scanning.
KIRK=>Transporter room. Status.
SCOTTY=>Scotty here, Captain. Transporter still inoperative. Even if we could lock on to the hostages, we canna beam them up.
KIRK=>Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
SPOCK=>Klingon vessel now entering quad- rant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.0 hours until her weapons come to bear.
KIRK=>Damn. Let's move.
UHURA'S VOICE=>Paradise City, this is the Starship Enterprise.
SYBOK=>A Federation ship.
CHEKOV=>This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
SYBOK=>Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
SPOCK=>Their scanning systems are primitive but effective. I recommend we land here co-ordinate Eight Five/ Six Three.
KIRK=>That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
SPOCK=>To land any closer would be to risk detection.
KIRK=>Mister Sulu... execute.
KIRK=>You okay, Spock?
SPOCK=>I am fine, Captain. Damn fine.
CHEKOV=>Even as we speak, a Klingon warship is on its way. We estimate arrival within the hour.
SYBOK=>I imagine the Klingons will be quite angry.
CHEKOV=>You are a master of understatement. They're likely to destroy the planet.
SYBOK=>Then its fortunate I have you and your starship to protect me. In
CHEKOV=>We will be happy to beam down but first we must have certain assurances.
SYBOK=>Name them.
SPOCK=>At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
KIRK=>We don't have 1.2 hours. Wait a minute...
UHURA=>I've always wanted to play to a "captive" audience.
KIRK=>Spock.
SPOCK=>Yes, Captain?
KIRK=>Be one with the horse.
J'ONN=>It's our look-out party. Open the gate.
KIRK=>Federation soldiers -- about a mile behind us! Close the gate!
KIRK=>There's more than a hundred of them! Fortify the walls!
KIRK=>Spock.
SPOCK=>Hold your horse, Captain. I am scan- ning. The hostages are in the structure just ahead.
KIRK=>Galileo, this is Strike Team. Start your run.
J'ONN=>Where are they going?
KIRK=>Phasers on stun! Get rid of the mounts! Sulu, take out that light!
SYBOK=>What's going on?
CHEKOV=>I instruct you to surrender at once. You are under attack by superior Federation forces.
SYBOK=>Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I was after.
CHEKOV=>Wait! Come back!
KIRK=>Thank God.
KIRK=>What the --
CAITHLIN=>Please co-operate.
TALBOT=>Would you mind handing over those weapons?
SYBOK=>Well done, my friends. Well done.
SPOCK=>Qual es tu... Sybok?
SPOCK=>Qual es tu?
SYBOK=>Spock...
SYBOK=>Spock!
SYBOK=>Still tight-assed...
SYBOK=>Spock, it's me. It's Sybok. You've
SPOCK=>Yes.
SYBOK=>Well?
SPOCK=>You are under arrest for violating seventeen counts of Neutral Zone treaty.
SYBOK=>Why, Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
SPOCK=>It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. If you surrender now --
SYBOK=>I'm sorry, Spock, but I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And for my next violation, I intend to steal something... something very big.
SYBOK=>I must have your starship.
KIRK=>
SYBOK=>Who are you?
KIRK=>James T. Kirk -- Captain of the Enterprise.
SYBOK=>But I thought Chekov... I see. Very clever, Captain. Spock, it would appear you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
SPOCK=>I am a Starfleet officer.
SYBOK=>Then I'll take the ship without your help.
SCOTTY=>Shuttle en route.
CHEKOV=>Position, Bird of Prey?
SCOTTY=>Closing.
VIXIS=>
SCOTTY=>Mister Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must've cloaked.
CHEKOV=>Raise shields.
SCOTTY=>But the shuttle --
CHEKOV=>Do it.
TALBOT=>Once we've taken control of your vessel, we'll bring up the rest of our followers.
KIRK=>The Klingons are out there. We'll be lucky to get back to the ship ourselves.
CHEKOV'S VOICE=>Galileo, this is Enterprise. Cond- ition red alert. Bird of Prey approaching -- she is cloaked. Raising shields. Recommend Galileo find safe harbor until situation secure. Acknowledge.
SYBOK=>No reply. Remain on course.
KIRK=>Sybok, listen to me. For this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower shields and activate the tractor beam. To bring us inside and then re-raise the shields will take...
SPOCK=>Exactly 15.5 seconds.
KIRK=>An eternity during which we'll be
KORRD=>He speaks the truth. If my people have cloaked then they intend to strike.
SYBOK=>We cannot turn back.
KIRK=>Then let me do something.
SPOCK=>You must allow us to act.
SYBOK=>Very well. Do what you must -- but no more.
KIRK=>Enterprise, this is Galileo.
KLAA=>
KIRK=>Understand your situation, Enterprise, but are unable to return to planet. Stand by to execute Emergency Landing Plan -- B.
CHEKOV=>What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
SCOTTY=>I dinna have a clue.
KIRK'S VOICE=>B as in "barricade."
SCOTTY=>He canna be serious.
KIRK=>In order to lower and raise shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly in manually.
SYBOK=>How often have you done this?
SULU=>Actually, it's my first attempt.
KIRK=>He's good. Really.
KIRK=>Kirk to Scotty -- lower shields!
SCOTTY=>Lowering shields...
UHURA=>Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
KIRK=>Go, Sulu.
SCOTTY=>They're in!
CHEKOV=>Transfer power to the warp drive. Warp speed now!
SYBOK=>We must change course at once.
KIRK=>I'll take you to the Bridge.
KIRK=>Spock... pick it up!
SPOCK=>Sybok, you must surrender.
SYBOK=>Spock, you can't stun me with that weapon and I've always been stronger than you. I'm afraid you'll have to kill me.
KIRK=>Spock -- shoot him!
SYBOK=>For a moment... I thought you might actually do it.
SYBOK=>Put these two in the Brig. Spock will accompany me to the Bridge.
SPOCK=>I will not.
SYBOK=>Then you must join them.
KORRD=>These two will be useful
SYBOK=>Give us a moment alone.
CAITHLIN=>Don't be afraid.
KIRK=>Dammiot. God dammit!
SPOCK=>Captain, what I have done --
KIRK=>What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
SPOCK=>Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me --
KIRK=>Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
SPOCK=>If you think that will help.
KIRK=>You stay out of this! Why, Spock? All you had to do was pull the trigger.
SPOCK=>If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
KIRK=>I ordered you to defend your ship.
SPOCK=>You ordered me to kill my brother.
KIRK=>The man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that's no reason --
SPOCK=>You did not hear me, Captain.
KIRK=>He's your brother brother? You made that up.
SPOCK=>I did not.
KIRK=>Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
SPOCK=>Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
KIRK=>You see?
SPOCK=>I have a half brother.
KIRK=>I need to sit down.
SPOCK=>That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. After her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
KIRK=>But why didn't you tell us this before?
SPOCK=>I was not prepared to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For
KIRK=>He's sorry. Well, I guess that makes everything all right, doesn't it?
SPOCK=>Nor I myself.
CHEKOV=>I was beginning to worry. Where is the Captain?
UHURA=>It's all right, Pavel. Sybok will explain everything.
CHEKOV=>Sulu, what are you doing?
SULU=>Plotting our new course.
CHEKOV=>New course? You have no authority. What have you done to them?
SULU=>Pavel, I'm doing what I think is right. You've got to listen to this man.
SYBOK=>I won't force you. The decision must be yours.
CHEKOV=>I don't understand...
SYBOK=>Each of us hides a secret pain. Share yours and gain strength from the sharing.
SPOCK=>Useless.
SPOCK=>Unwise.
KIRK=>You could've warned me.
KIRK=>There's got to be a way out of here.
SPOCK=>This is a completely new Brig, Captain. It is escape proof.
KIRK=>How do you know?
SPOCK=>The desighners tested it on the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
KIRK=>This person... he didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
SPOCK=>He did have pointed ears...
CHEKOV=>Following new course. Warp Seven.
SULU=>Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
SYBOK=>Now that we're underway, it's time I announced my intentions to the rest of the ship.
SYBOK'S VOICE=>Brave crew of the Starship Enterprise...
SYBOK=>Consider the questions of existence. "Who am I? Why am I here? Does God exist? These are the questionsd man has asked ever since he first gazed at the stars and dreamed. My Vulcan ancestors were ruled by their emotions. They felt with their hearts ... made love with their hearts... and believed with their hearts. Above all else, they believed
SPOCK=>Is it possible?
KIRK=>Is what possible?
SPOCK=>That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
SYBOK=>Our destination... the planet Sha Ka Ree. It lies beyond the Great Barrier at the Center of the Galaxy.
KIRK=>Center of the Galaxy?
SPOCK=>Where Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
KIRK=>But the Center of the Galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
SPOCK=>Sybok possessed the keenest intel- lect I have ever known.
KIRK=>Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok's in here you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
SPOCK=>I am with you.
KIRK=>That's a little vague, Spock --
KIRK=>What is that damn noise?
SPOCK=>I believe it is a primitive form of communication known as Morse Code.
KIRK=>You're right, Spock. I'm a little out of practice... Let's see... that's an "s."
SPOCK=>I believe the next letter is a "t."
KIRK=>"a"... "n"... "d"... end of word.
KIRK=>New word. "b"... "a"... "c"... "k."
TOGETHER=>Stand back.
SCOTTY=>Well, what're waiting for? Dinna you know a jailbreak when you see one?
SYBOK=>The bond between these three is strong... difficult to penetrate. This is going to be quite a challenge.
SULU=>We've got to find them!
SCOTTY=>Captain, we canna trust no one.
KIRK=>If we could send a distress signal...
SPOCK=>There is an emergency sending appar- atus in the forward observation room.
KIRK=>The only problem is, it's up there and we're down here.
SCOTTY=>You might be able to reach it by means of turbo shaft number three which is closed for repairs. It would be a long and dangerous climb...
KIRK=>Scotty, get the transporter working. If we make contact with a rescue ship, we'll need it.
SCOTTY=>Aye, sir. Count on me.
KIRK=>Now... which way to the turbo shaft?
SCOTTY=>Head down this tunnel and make a right at the hydro vent, then a left at the blowscreen. You canna miss it.
KIRK=>Mister Scott, you're amazing.
SCOTTY=>Nothing amazing about it. Why I know this ship like I know the back of my hand.
COMPUTER VOICE=>Secure all levels.
KIRK=>Look at it this way. We'll get a good workout.
KIRK=>Where's Spock?
SPOCK=>I believe I have found a faster way.
KIRK=>Bones...
KIRK=>We're not splitting up.
SPOCK=>It would appear we are too heavy.
KIRK=>It's all those marsh melons.
SULU=>There!
KIRK=>Spock... the booster rockets.
SPOCK=>If I activate them, we will be propelled upward at unpredictable speed.
KIRK=>Fire the boosters!
SPOCK=>I am afraid I overshot our mark by one level.
SPOCK=>Emergency channel open.
KIRK=>To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge.
FEMALE VOICE=>Enterprise, this is Starfleet Command. We read you. Over.
KIRK=>A hostile force has seized control of our vessel and put us on a direct course with the Great Barrier. Our co-ordinates are zero-zero-zero, \mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
FEMALE VOICE=>Understood, Enterprise...
KIRK=>Roger, Starfleet.
KLAA=>
VIXIS=>
SYBOK=>I trust your message was received?
KIRK=>You can't expect us to stand by while you take this ship into the Great Barrier. It can't be done.
SYBOK=>What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world to be flat... but Columbus proved it was round.
KIRK=>I'm afraid of nothing.
SYBOK=>Wait outside.
SYBOK=>I'm sure you have many questions. Here, with the stars of the galaxy for our backdrop, we shall seek the answers together.
UHURA=>Easy, Scotty. Your back with us.
SCOTTY=>Uhura. I had the strangest dream. I dreamt a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
SCOTTY=>He's not?
UHURA=>Sybok's put us in touch with feel- ings we've always been afraid to express.
SCOTTY=>I... er... have to get back to the transporter.
UHURA=>But there's so much I want to tell you.
SCOTTY=>Maybe when I'm a wee bit stronger. I dinna think I could take it in my present condition. Or yours.
SYBOK=>Sha Ka Ree. "The Source." Call it what you will. "Heaven." "Eden." The Klingons call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is... unpronoun- cable. Every culture shares this common dream of the place from
KIRK=>The only reality I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
SYBOK=>I don't control minds. I free them.
SYBOK=>By making you face your pain and draw strength from it. Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.
KIRK=>Spock?
SPOCK=>It is an ancient Vulcan ritual -- forbidden in modern times.
SYBOK=>Your pain is the deepest of all.
SYBOK=>I can feel it. Can't you?
MAN'S VOICE=>Leonard...
MAN'S VOICE=>Leonard...
FATHER=>Leonard...
FATHER=>The pain... stop the pain...
FATHER=>Can't stand the pain. Help me.
SYBOK=>You've done all you can. The support system will keep him alive.
FATHER=>Release... me...
SYBOK=>You're a doctor.
SYBOK=>Why did you do it?
SYBOK=>Share it.
SYBOK=>If you hadn't killed him, he might have lived.
SYBOK=>You did what you thought was right.
SYBOK=>You must release this pain.
SYBOK=>This pain has poisoned your soul for a long time. But now you've taken the first step. The other steps we'll take together.
SYBOK=>Each man's pain is unique.
SYBOK=>I know you better than that.
SPOCK=>Do you?
KIRK=>Spock... don't.
SPOCK=>It's all right, Captain. Proceed.
KIRK=>What is this?
SPOCK=>I believe we are witnessing my birth.
SAREK=>So human.
AMANDA=>Neither yours nor mine.
KIRK=>Spock...
SPOCK=>Sybok has failed. I resolved this pain long ago.
YOUNG SYBOK'S VOICE=>Spock...
YOUNG SYBOK=>I must go now.
SPOCK=>Sybok? Wait.
YOUNG SYBOK=>I can't. They've banished me.
SPOCK=>Then take me with you.
SYBOK=>Spock...
SPOCK=>I want to go with you.
YOUNG SYBOK=>It's not possible. I'm an enemy of the people a heretic. Besides, you have chosen the Vulcan way.
SPOCK=>But where will you go?
YOUNG SYBOK=>Where I can be free... where I can prove I was right. I'll find Sha Ka Ree.
SPOCK=>Sybok...
SYBOK=>That is your pain. You begged to come with me then. Come with me now.
KIRK=>Spock... What have you done to my friends?
SYBOK=>I've done nothing. This is who they are, didn't you know that?
KIRK=>No... I didn't.
SYBOK=>Now learn something about yourself.
KIRK=>No. I refuse.
KIRK=>About what? Thay I've made the wrong choices in my life? That I went left
KIRK=>To be brainwashed by this con man?
KIRK=>Dammit, Bones, you're a doctor. You know that pain and guilt can't be taken away with the wave of a magic wand. They're things we carry with us -- the things that make us who we are. If we lose them, we lose ourselves. I don't want my pain taken away. I need my pain.
UHURA'S VOICE=>Sybok, this is the Bridge. We are in approach of the Great Barrier.
SYBOK=>Captain, I'm afraid you'll have to remain here. Spock... Doctor... come with me.
SYBOK=>Spock?
SPOCK=>I cannot go with you.
SYBOK=>Why?
SPOCK=>I stand with my captain.
SYBOK=>I don't understand...
SPOCK=>You are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind. Since that time I have found myself and my place in the world... here... among these people... my shipmates. This ship is my life.
SYBOK=>Then I'll see you on the other side.
KIRK=>Wait! You know we'll never make it through the Barrier.
SYBOK=>But if we do, will that convince you
KIRK=>What vision?
SYBOK=>Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.
KIRK=>You are mad.
SYBOK=>Am I? We'll see.
SYBOK=>I say they're wrong. I say the danger is an illusion.
CHEKOV=>We have no instrument readings. Is it there or isn't it?
SYBOK=>Mister Sulu... full ahead.
SULU=>Full ahead, aye.
KIRK=>If we are, then life is a dream.
SPOCK=>Fascinating.
CHEKOV=>Instruments are back on line. Incred- ible. There's a power source emanating from the planet like nothing I've ever seen.
SYBOK=>Sha Ka Ree.
CAITHLIN=>Vorta Vor.
KORRD=>Qui'Tu.
TALBOT=>Eden.
KIRK=>About the ship...
SYBOK=>It needs its Captain.
KIRK=>No special conditions?
SYBOK=>No conditions.
KIRK=>What makes you think I won't turn us around?
SYBOK=>Because you too, must know.
KIRK=>Then if we're going to do it... ... we'll do it by the book. Chekov take the conn. Sulu, standard orbit approach. Uhura, alert the shuttle- craft to stand by. Sybok, Spock and Doctor McCoy with me. The rest of you will remain on board until I've determined what we're dealing with.
SYBOK=>We have travelled far by starship...
KIRK=>Enterprise, this is Kirk...
SPOCK=>Perhaps --
VOICE=>Brave souls. Welcome.
BEING=>Does this better suit your expect- ations?
SYBOK=>Qual se tu?
BEING=>It is I. The journey you took to reach me could not have been an easy one.
SYBOK=>It was not. The Barrier stood between us -- but we breached it.
BEING=>Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
SYBOK=>We sought only your infinite wisdom.
BEING=>And how did you breach the Barrier?
SYBOK=>With a starship!
BEING=>Ah. This starship... could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
SYBOK=>It could. Yes!
BEING=>Then I shall make use of this starship.
SYBOK=>It will be your chariot!
KIRK=>Excuse me.
BEING=>It will carry my power to every corner of creation...
KIRK=>Excuse me.
KIRK=>I just wanted to ask a question.
KIRK=>What does GOD need with a starship?
BEING=>Bring the ship closer.
KIRK=>I said... what does God need with a starship?
KIRK=>I'm asking a question.
BEING=>Who is this creature?
KIRK=>Who am I? Don't you know? Aren't you God?
SYBOK=>He has his doubts...
BEING=>You doubt me?
KIRK=>I seek proof.
BEING=>Then here is the proof you seek.
KIRK=>Why... is God... angry?
SYBOK=>I don't understand. Why have you done this to my friend?
BEING=>He doubts me.
SPOCK=>You have not answered his question. What does God need with a starship?
BEING=>Do you doubt me?
SYBOK=>Stop! The God of Sha Ka Ree would not do this!
BEING=>Sha Ka Ree? An eternity I've been imprisoned in this place! The ship! I must have the ship! Now give me what I want!
SPOCK=>Sybok -- this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree -- or any other God!
SYBOK=>I don't understand... Reveal yourself to me!
BEING=>What's wrong? Don't you like this face? I have many but this one suits you best.
SYBOK=>No... it's not possible.
BEING=>Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
SYBOK=>The ship...
BEING=>Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it or watch these puny things die horribly.
KIRK=>Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
SYBOK=>Spock, what have I done?
SPOCK=>Sybok...
SYBOK=>This is my doing! My arrogance... my vanity... Save yourselves!
SPOCK=>No, Sybok!
SYBOK=>Forgive me.
SYBOK=>I couldn't help but notice your pain.
BEING=>My pain?
SYBOK=>It runs deep. Share it with me.
KIRK=>Enterprise... are you ready?
SULU=>In firing position. Torpedo armed.
CHEKOV=>But Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
KIRK'S VOICE=>Send it down Mister Chekov -- now!
SPOCK=>Sybok...
KIRK=>We've got to get out of here.
VIXIS=>
KIRK=>Spock, get us out of here!
SPOCK=>Thrusters are inoperative.
KIRK=>Scotty!
SCOTTY=>Scotty here, Captain.
KIRK=>Now would be a good time to tell me the transporter's working.
SCOTTY=>She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
KIRK=>Beam up Spock and Doctor McCoy. Do it!
SPOCK=>Mister Scott, send the beam back down.
SCOTTY=>Aye, sir.
SPOCK=>Please, Doctor, try to get a grip on yourself. Status report.
UHURA=>Mister Spock, Klingon captain wishes to name his terms.
SPOCK=>On screen.
KLAA=>This is Captain Klaa of the Klingon Empire. Attempts to raise shields or arm weapons and I will destroy you. You are alive for a single reason. The renegade James T. Kirk! Hand him over and I will spare your lives. My transporter stands ready to beam him aboard.
SPOCK=>Captain Kirk is not among us.
KLAA=>You lie!
SPOCK=>I am a Vulcan. I cannot lie. Captain Kirk is on the planet below.
KLAA=>Then give me his co-ordinates!
SPOCK=>General, I am in need of your assis- tance.
KORRD=>My assistance?
SPOCK=>You are his superior officer.
KORRD=>I can do nothing! I am a foolish old man.
SPOCK=>Damn you, sir, you will try!
CREATURE=>Give... me... the... ship.
KIRK=>So it's me you want, you Klingon bastards! Come and get me!
SPOCK=>Welcome aboard, Captain.
KORRD=>Release him.
KIRK=>Spock, I thought I was going to die.
SPOCK=>Not possible. You were never alone.
SPOCK=>Please, Captain. Not in front of the Klingons.
SPOCK=>It has occured to me.
SPOCK=>I will say this much Doctor. We have yet to reach the final frontier.
SCOTTY=>Would you care for a wee nip of scotch whisky?
KORRD=>Umm...
SCOTTY=>I never thought I'd be drinking with a Klingon.
KORRD=>And what are you two conspiring about?
TALBOT=>We are just thinking how far we've
KORRD=>We certainly have.
TALBOT=>Good heavens! We've just agreed on something!
CAITHLIN=>Gentlemen, it's about time.
KIRK=>Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?
KIRK=>Maybe He's not out there, Bones. Maybe He's right here... in human heart. Spock?
SPOCK=>I was thinking of Sybok.
KIRK=>I lost a brother once. But I was lucky; I got him back.
KIRK=>I was wrong.
KIRK=>Well, are you just going to sit there and pick at it or are you going to play something?
VOICES=>"... merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream..."
