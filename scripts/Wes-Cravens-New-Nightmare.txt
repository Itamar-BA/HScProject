VOICE=>More blood, more blood!
CRAVEN=>Chase, you're a genius! This makes his old claw look like Mother Theresa's!
CHUCK=>Thank you.
TERRY=>It's some of our best work.
CHASE=>Want to see some neat stuff?
HEATHER=>Chase, no.
CHASE=>Come on, it's only make believe!
HEATHER=>Chase!
CHUCK=>It should have flexed more. I think the servos got shorted out with blood.
CHASE=>Insulate 'em with some styro. It wasn't designed to be submerged, for Petesakes.
HEATHER=>I don't like that thing.
CHASE=>This thing puts bread on our table.
DYLAN=>Is it alive, Daddy?
A.D.=>Heather, you're in the next shot!
CHASE=>Might as well be, Dylan. State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting. Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
HEATHER=>Chase...
CHASE=>Hey...
CHUCK=>Must've picked up something from an AD's walkie-talkie...
TERRY=>You sure it's turned off?
CHASE=>It's off.
TERRY=>Funny. It's warm. Like a real hand.
CRAVEN=>What the hell's going on?! Kill the effects!
CHASE=>Heather!
CHASE=>Heather!! Earthquake!!
DYLAN=>Mommmmeee!
HEATHER=>Dylan!
CHASE=>Car alarms. You okay?
DYLAN=>no.
HEATHER=>You have a fever, sweetie?
CHASE=>Just an earthquake, Dylan. Every once in a while we get a few.
HEATHER=>No biggie, really.
DYLAN=>Daddy, blood.
CHASE=>Nothing, guys, just a scratch.
HEATHER=>Where'd you...get that?
CHASE=>The picture, I guess. When it fell. It's nothing, really.
HEATHER=>One of mom's cups got broken.
CHASE=>I'm sorry. At least we're in on piece.
HEATHER=>Do we have to watch that?
CHASE=>I thought you turned it on.
HEATHER=>Dylan, it's breakfast. Not arts and crafts What?
CHASE=>You get any sleep last night?
HEATHER=>More or less. Dylan, time to get dressed. I'm late.
DYLAN=>You going away?
HEATHER=>Just for a few hours. Julie'll be with you.
CHASE=>Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
HEATHER=>Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
CHASE=>Hasn't been another call, has there?
HEATHER=>He feels closer, if anything. It's giving me nightmares.
CHASE=>You have one last night?
HEATHER=>Maybe. Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
CHASE=>You've got to get back on the horse some time. Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls. I know how scary that feels.
HEATHER=>No, you don't.
CHASE=>Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
HEATHER=>What if it isn't over?
CHASE=>Maybe you should tell me your dream.
HEATHER=>It was nothing. We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong. Terry and Chuck were...hurt. You were almost... You were even cut.
CHASE=>You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass. Dreams work like that. You want me not to go on this job?
HEATHER=>Just be careful, okay?
CHASE=>I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
HEATHER=>Guess so.
CHASE=>48 hours. Back before you know it.
TINA=>Naaancyyyy....
HEATHER=>Dylan, I don't want you watching that.
VOICE=>One two...
HEATHER=>Chase!
DYLAN=>Someone's coming.
HEATHER=>What?
VOICE=>Heather?
JULIE=>Everything okay?
HEATHER=>Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry. I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think. Little one, but...
JULIE=>Big truck went right by before you opened the door. Life on the Fault Line.
HEATHER=>You think he has a fever? He felt warm to me this morning.
JULIE=>Seems okay. That all that's wrong? You seem...
HEATHER=>Leave us alone, you creep!
VOICE=>LA Limousine, ma'am. Just wanted you to know I'm out front.
HEATHER=>Uh, sorry. Hang on a minute.
JULIE=>Heather, what is it?
HEATHER=>Dunno. Just have this feeling today...
DYLAN=>Mommy stay home, then.
JULIE=>He'll be fine, don't worry.
MAN'S VOICE=>Studio B.
HEATHER=>Hi. This is Heather Langenkamp.
MAN'S VOICE=>The car's no there yet?
HEATHER=>No. I...listen, I can't make it in today.
MAN'S VOICE=>You're kidding, right?
HEATHER=>I'm sorry, I can't.
MAN'S VOICE=>Listen, dammit.
HEATHER=>I just can't.
VOICE=>One two...
HEATHER=>Hello?
VOICE=>Freddy's coming for yooooouuuu.
JULIE=>What is it, Heather?
HEATHER=>Damn caller.
JULIE=>He's started again?
HEATHER=>Nerves?
JULIE=>I just meant form the shaker this morning. I mean, everyone's freaked out at how many we've been having. Then the calls.
HEATHER=>Stop calling me, you sonuvabitch!
HEATHER=>I'm sorry, Jerry. I just...can't leave the house right now.
JERRY=>What, you wanna single-handedly bury your career?! Lose your house, put your husband and kid out on the street? Or just give your old agent a heart attack?
HEATHER=>Okay, fine, I'll be there. It's just, the calls started again.
JERRY=>Unfortunately, this kinda crap is part of the business these days, Heather. Have you thought of buying a good handgun?
HEATHER=>I've got a five-year old in the house, Jerry!
JERRY=>He's an L.A. kid, probably already has one. Call me after the interview, okay?
HEATHER=>Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?
DYLAN=>Bye.
JULIE=>I'll call the cops for you. You've got the number on the fridge, right?
HEATHER=>Thanks. Just give them the time he called. They're keeping a list, supposedly. Sorry. My nerves are so raw these days.
JULIE=>'S okay.
DRIVER=>You played that girl...in that movie...with the guy with the Yeah, sure, that's you. That's what I love about this job, I get to meet the stars.
HEATHER=>I'm hardly a star.
DRIVER=>You kidding? I love your stuff. First was the best. Where your girl friend's cut open and dragged across the ceiling? Awesome! And when all that blood comes out of your boyfriend's bed? Thought I'd shi...
P.A.=>Heather? We're gonna have to run!
HOST=>So, Heather, we're coming up on the 10th anniversary of the first Nightmare on Elm Street. It's five sequels later. Tell us how this amazing series has affected your life personally.
HEATHER=>I don't know if it has, really. With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it. I'm working in television now. The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
HOST=>Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
HEATHER=>No, not really. I...
HOST=>Do you let your child watch your movies?
HEATHER=>My child? No...but...
HOST=>What about another sequel? Is Freddy really dead?
HEATHER=>Of course he is. Freddy's dead and gone.
HOST=>And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I. Would you trust him alone with your child?
HEATHER=>Robert? I...
HOST=>Maybe we should ask him, hmmm? We've got a surprised, Heather. A great big surprise for you and our audience.
ROBERT ENGLUND=>You're all my children now!
ROBERT ENGLUND=>You okay?
HEATHER=>I'm fine.
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Everything went great, I thought. We really got you, didn't we?
HEATHER=>I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Hey, they loved the expression on your face. I think they'd love to see us together again!
HEATHER=>In what, a romantic comedy?
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
MAN=>Heather? Call for you!
HEATHER=>Yes?
SARA=>Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line. How are you?
HEATHER=>Oh, hi. I'm fine, Sara. My God, a voice from the past!
SARA=>Really! Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time. It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
HEATHER=>Uh...sure...when?
SARA=>No time like the present. The car will bring you.
HEATHER=>Now?
SARA=>Just take a minute. You'll be glad you did, I bet.
RECEPTIONIST=>Help you?
HEATHER=>I'm here to see Bob Shaye.
RECEPTIONIST=>Was Bob expecting you?
VOICE=>Heather!
SARA=>Bob's dying to see you.
MIKE DE LUCA=>Hey, I'm a fan! Great meeting you.
SARA=>Can I get you something to drink?
HEATHER=>Coffee'd be nice.
SARA=>Sounds good. Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee? How you like it, Hon?
HEATHER=>Black's fine.
SARA=>Me too.
BOB=>Gotta go. Call me when you get to Milan. And don't forget risotto con tarfutti. Fantastico! Have fun.
HEATHER=>Fine. I don't have to ask how you're doing.
BOB=>So far so good. Maybe we can send a little your way, too, if you're up for it.
HEATHER=>I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
BOB=>We did. Bad mistake. The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right? Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes. He's got this idea. And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
HEATHER=>I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
BOB=>Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare. They're his inspiration. But now he's got a new script in the works.
HEATHER=>Which means he's having nightmares again?
BOB=>He's very excited about it.
HEATHER=>The nightmares.
BOB=>He's excited about the script. You should be too. It stars you.
HEATHER=>Can I read it?
BOB=>He's not showing it until it's down. But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is. You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
HEATHER=>You mean that was a...
BOB=>Sort of a trial balloon.
HEATHER=>I don't know, Bob. I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
BOB=>So?
HEATHER=>So I don't know about horror.
BOB=>Come on. Kids love horror.
HEATHER=>And I...I've got other things happening.
BOB=>I'm sure we can match any offer.
HEATHER=>It's not that. I've got a fan.
BOB=>Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies. You rate right up there. We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
HEATHER=>What?
BOB=>I know. We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked. Look, how about we get in touch your agent. You still with Jerry?
HEATHER=>Yes, but...
BOB=>We'll work something out. I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
HEATHER=>Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
BOB=>I don't know. A couple months. Why?
HEATHER=>And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened?
BOB=>I don't follow.
HEATHER=>Like weird calls, by any chance?
BOB=>That's what people get paid for around here.
KIM=>It's Ted in New York. He wants to know how the glove is coming.
BOB=>Gotta take that. Keep in touch.
HEATHER=>You too, Bob.
DYLAN=>Never sleep again, never sleep again!
HEATHER=>What's going on? Was he watching the movie on TV again?
JULIE=>Movie? He hasn't been watching any TV at all. He was taking his nap when I heard screaming.
DYLAN=>Rex saved me.
HEATHER=>Rex? Who's Rex?
DYLAN=>Is Rex gonna die?
HEATHER=>No, Rex is not going to die. Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
JULIE=>Sure. We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
CHASE=>Heather?
HEATHER=>Chase. Hi...
CHASE=>What's up?
HEATHER=>Chase, you'd better come home.
CHASE=>Heather, I'm stuck here. Neither Chuck or Terry came in today. I can't get away!
HEATHER=>Chase, it's Dylan!
CHASE=>What?
HEATHER=>He's had some sort of...episode.
CHASE=>What? What kind of episode?
HEATHER=>He was just acting very strange. He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me. He was acting like...
CHASE=>Like what?
HEATHER=>Like Freddy.
CHASE=>Heather, has there been another call?
HEATHER=>Chase. Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
CHASE=>Forget those two clowns, Heather. Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
HEATHER=>Yes.
CHASE=>I'll be there in three hours.
HEATHER=>Don't speed, Chase. It's not...
HEATHER=>"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire. 'We will bake cookies first,' she said. 'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough. Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside." Dylan, this is too violent. I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
DYLAN=>Finish, please!
HEATHER=>This is going to give you nightmares.
DYLAN=>I like this story.
HEATHER=>"But Gretel guessed what the witch was planning. 'I don't know how to get in,' Gretel said. 'How am I to manage it?' 'Stupid girl!' shouted the witch, rushing up to the oven. 'The opening is big enough. See, I can fit myself.' Then quickly Gretel came behind and pushed with all her might. Plunging the wicked old woman headlong into the flames, banging the door shut and bolting it tight. The witch howled..." That's enough.
DYLAN=>"The witch howled like a scalded cat, but Gretel ran away and left her there to perish nonetheless."
HEATHER=>Time for sleep.
DYLAN=>Say how they find their way back home.
HEATHER=>Tomorrow night.
DYLAN=>No. Tonight. It's important!
HEATHER=>Dylan, you know as well as I do, they follow the trail of bread crumbs back to their house.
DYLAN=>"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
HEATHER=>They were safe and could sleep.
DYLAN=>Rex.
HEATHER=>Who?
DYLAN=>The mean old man with the claws.
HEATHER=>Dylan, there's nothing down there. Look...
DYLAN=>It's different when you're gone.
HEATHER=>Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
DYLAN=>Don't let the bedbugs bite.
HEATHER=>He's on his way.
DYLAN=>He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
HEATHER=>Right.
DYLAN=>It the birds don't eat them first.
NEWSCASTER=>...tectonic nightmare...fault line hitherto unknown seems to be spread so extensive that ...
CHASE=>This is meeee, losing myyyy religion. Look at meee, losing myyyy...
DYLAN=>Mommy scared?
HEATHER=>Mommy's fine, Dylan. Just had a bad dream. What're you doing out of bed?
DYLAN=>Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
HEATHER=>Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
DYLAN=>Not sleepy.
HEATHER=>Dylan, go back to bed. I mean it.
HEATHER=>Yes?
HEATHER=>Yes.
HEATHER=>Is he...I mean, was he hurt?
HEATHER=>Is he dead?
HEATHER=>Are you sure it's him? I...
HEATHER=>I want to see the body.
HEATHER=>I want to see for myself.
THIRD MAN=>Help you?
HEATHER=>Porter. Chase Porter.
THIRD MAN=>That a new one?
LUNCH EATER=>Over there, third from the sink.
HEATHER=>Let me see once more.
LUNCH EATER=>I'm sorry.
HEATHER=>Lift the sheet again.
LUNCH EATER=>Uh, well, this was a bad wreck, ma'am. I mean, his head's gonna be okay for the funeral and all, but...
HEATHER=>What did that?
LUNCH EATER=>Ma'am, it was head-on. I heard the truck was torn up something awful. You can imagine how he'd, well, not be exactly in top shape.
HEATHER=>It looks like...he was clawed.
LUNCH EATER=>Yeah, well, that's why we don't lift the sheet past the face, ma'am. Sometimes what you don't see is what gets you through the night.
HEATHER=>Julie. Where's Dylan?!
JOHN SAXON=>He's right here. It's okay!
HEATHER=>What...happened?
JOHN SAXON=>Quake knocked you off your feet. You got bumped pretty good, actually.
MINISTER=>May he rest in peace, children. And my you all get home safely!
ROBERT ENGLUND=>If there's anything I can do, Heater. Anything...
HEATHER=>Dylan. Sweetie. Wake up, baby...
DYLAN=>I can't sleep there, Mommy. Please!
HEATHER=>You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
DYLAN=>One two, Freddy's coming for you...
HEATHER=>Dylan, did you hear that in that move?
DYLAN=>What movie?
HEATHER=>Then...where did you hear that song? Did you answer the phone?
DYLAN=>In my bed.
HEATHER=>Your bed?
DYLAN=>Under my covers. Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
HEATHER=>And...what's the man doing?
DYLAN=>Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
HEATHER=>Oh, shit. Dylan.
DYLAN=>Where's Daddy now?
HEATHER=>Daddy's...in Heaven, Dylan. He's with God now.
DYLAN=>Do you have to die to see God?
HEATHER=>No, I don't think so. You just have to...pray, or reach...
DYLAN=>Why does God let there be bad things?
HEATHER=>I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
DYLAN=>Can you come with me in my dreams?
HEATHER=>I think that only happens in movies. But I'll always be here when you get back. And I'll make sure nobody grabs your toes, either.
HEATHER=>I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted. I just can't believe it's him. I mean, and not something outside, influencing him. Or is that how denial works?
JOHN SAXON=>When it is denial. I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
HEATHER=>You're not just saying that to help a crazy friend cope, are you?
JOHN SAXON=>All of Dylan's behavior is understandable for a kid dealing with a parent's death. How can a child process such a thing?
HEATHER=>Don't know. Haven't been able to process it very well myself.
JOHN SAXON=>You're not crazy, by the way.
HEATHER=>Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in...
JOHN SAXON=>You didn't jump in.
HEATHER=>That's my memory. And it seemed absolutely real.
JOHN SAXON=>Seemed, not was.
HEATHER=>It's in my family, you know. My grandmother died in an institution...
JOHN SAXON=>Really? Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
HEATHER=>I've never mentioned it to him.
JOHN SAXON=>Kids know when something's bugging a parent. You've got no idea who this is calling?
HEATHER=>Freddy, for all I know.
JOHN SAXON=>Steady...
HEATHER=>A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
JOHN SAXON=>Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams? Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere. Even at Mass.
HEATHER=>Really?
JOHN SAXON=>Absolutely. And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again? It gets under your skin if you let it.
HEATHER=>You really think Dylan's okay?
JOHN SAXON=>Dylan's fine. You're fine. Hurting, but fine. Definitely not crazy.
HEATHER=>It's my worst fear, that whatever my mother had, I'll have. And I'll pass it along to...
DYLAN=>God wouldn't take me.
HEATHER=>Robert?
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Heather? You doing okay?
HEATHER=>Holding my own. You know that guy who was calling me all the time? He's started again. He's been putting stuff in my mail.
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Must've read about the funeral. Sick mother. That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
HEATHER=>It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Freddy as in me?
HEATHER=>It isn't you. He's scarier. He's...
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Darker. More...evil?
HEATHER=>Yeah...how'd you know?
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Call it a guess...
HEATHER=>Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least. I asked him at the funeral.
HEATHER=>When do you think it'll be done?
ROBERT ENGLUND=>The way he's writing is so weird, who knows? I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...? Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God. Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
HEATHER=>Robert? Have you been having any nightmares?
ROBERT ENGLUND=>Uh, actually today's not good. There's something I've got to finish. How's tomorrow?
HEATHER=>Tomorrow, then. First thing in the morning. Meanwhile take care, Robert, okay?
DYLAN=>One two, Freddy's coming for you. Three four, better lock your door...
DYLAN=>Five six, grab your crucifix...
HEATHER=>Sweetie, don't sing that...
DYLAN=>Seven eight, better stay up late!
DYLAN=>Never sleep again.
DYLAN=>Never sleep again, never sleep again...
HEATHER=>Dylan...
FREDDY=>I touched him.
DR. HEFNER=>Any history of epilepsy in your family?
HEATHER=>No.
DR. HEFNER=>Diabetes?
HEATHER=>No.
DR. HEFNER=>Was there any trigger event? A trauma, shock or... You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you? The horror stuff?
HEATHER=>No...
DR. HEFNER=>Good. I'm convinced they can tip an unstable child over the edge.
HEATHER=>Unstable? Dylan's not unstable, he's... just...upset.
DR. HEFNER=>We'll run a battery of tests and know in a few days.
HEATHER=>Does he have to stay here over night?
DR. HEFNER=>Absolutely.
HEATHER=>Like what?
DR. HEFNER=>Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him. Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
HEATHER=>No. Dylan didn't say anything.
NURSE=>What have we here?
DR. HEFNER=>It's too soon to know for sure, but the early symptoms point towards childhood schizophrenia.
HEATHER=>Dylan, can you hear me?
DYLAN=>Home.
HEATHER=>Home, that's right.
NURSE=>Time for your medicine, cowboy.
HEATHER=>What is that?
NURSE=>Just something to help him sleep.
HEATHER=>Okay, Dylan. I'll be back here first thing tomorrow. I love you.
RADIO NEWSCASTER=>Seismologists at CalTech have counted over 300 of the temblors so far. Though most were too faint for us to feel, seven have shaken our community in the last two weeks. And now scientists are speculating there might be an unknown fault running beneath Los Angeles, a fault that could...
PATRICE=>Robert?
HEATHER=>This is Heather, Patrice. I was calling for Robert. He's not there?
PATRICE=>He's...out of the house, Heather.
HEATHER=>Will he be back any time soon?
PATRICE=>Uh...actually, we're ducking out of town for a while.
WES=>I wish I could tell you where this script is going. I don't know. Look, I dream a scene, I write it down the next morning. Your guess is as good as mine as to how it ends.
HEATHER=>Well at least tell me what it's about so far.
WES=>I can tell you what the nightmares are about. They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it. It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times. The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
HEATHER=>What's that?
WES=>Killing innocence, one way or the other.
HEATHER=>This is still a script we're talking about, right?
WES=>I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
HEATHER=>Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
WES=>It can be captured, sometimes.
HEATHER=>Captured? How?
WES=>By storytellers, of all things. Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence. Then it's held prisoner for a while. In the story.
HEATHER=>Like the Genie in the bottle.
WES=>Exactly. The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned. However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
HEATHER=>You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
WES=>Current version. For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street. But now that the films have stopped- The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
HEATHER=>If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go? Another age? Another form?
WES=>That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
HEATHER=>Then what is he doing?
WES=>Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now. And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too. So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
HEATHER=>Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
WES=>Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person. A gatekeeper, so to speak. Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world. It's you, Heather.
HEATHER=>Me? Why me?
WES=>Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense. You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
HEATHER=>That was Nancy, not me!
WES=>But it was you that gave Nancy her strength. So to get out he has to come through you. And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
HEATHER=>Dylan. And... Chase. My God, Wes, did you know?
WES=>Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
HEATHER=>You know damn well it's more than that now! How can we stop him?
WES=>The way to stop him is to make another movie. And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script. But when that time comes... You're gonna have to make a choice.
HEATHER=>Choice? What kind of choice?
WES=>Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
SARA=>...incipience of aphasia commonly preceded by periods of acute irritability...delusional accounts of shadow figures... hearing of voices... seizures, nausea and emesis...
ANNOUNCER=>A six-point quake on the Richter Scale, bringing scattered destruction throughout L.A. Basin...
SARA=>Heather? This is Sara. Um, sorry to call so late, but...this is kinda hard... I don't know if you've seen the news, but... we just are thinking we might shelf this new Nightmare project for a while, and wanted you to know. Call. Bye.
FREDDY=>Naaaaancy!
HEATHER=>Dylan!
HEATHER=>Julie, what're you doing here?
JULIE=>I don't know. I just...had this terrible dream...that Dylan was in danger. I had to come over to see... You must think I'm crazy.
HEATHER=>No, I don't think that at all. How is he?
JULIE=>They wouldn't let me...
DR. HEFNER=>Ms. Langenkamp. I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
HEATHER=>Is he all right?
DR. HEFNER=>Dylan? He's holding well. Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
HEATHER=>Oh my God...
DR. HEFNER=>It seems we've had an accident, Mrs. Langekamp. May I?
HEATHER=>It happened during the earthquake. I fell. I want to see Dylan...
DR. HEFNER=>In a moment, first let's see about you.
DR. HEFNER=>If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
HEATHER=>It was an earthquake and it was dark. I have no idea.
DR. HEFNER=>These look quite fresh.
HEATHER=>They are...it happened in tonight's quake. It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
DR. HEFNER=>Guess we lucked out over here.
HEATHER=>I meant to bring him his dinosaur, Rex. Rex keeps Freddy from...
DR. HEFNER=>The man from your films? Freddy Krueger with the claws? Is that who he's afraid of? You have let your child see your films, haven't you?
HEATHER=>Every kid knows about Freddy. He's like Santa Claus or King Kong.
DR. HEFNER=>I see. Well. Interesting talking to you, Ms. Langenkamp. I hope you understand, my concerns are simply for the welfare of your son.
HEATHER=>Dylan, honey. You shouldn't do that!
DYLAN/FREDDY=>Too late. I'm almost there, Heather, I'm almost there.
HEATHER=>Doctor...
DR. HEFNER=>Get her back! I've got to go in! Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
NURSE=>We don't have any here, doctor.
DR. HEFNER=>Screw it, then. I'm going in!
HEATHER=>Nooooo!
NURSE=>Now what have you done to yourself, Miss?
HEATHER=>He's got him. He's got my Dylan!
NURSE=>Who? Who's got him?
HEATHER=>Freddy...
HEATHER=>My baby. Freddy's got my baby! He's got my Dylan!
DR. HEFNER=>Ms. Langenkamp. I suggest you go home and get some rest. Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
HEATHER=>He was just here!
DR. HEFNER=>He was here. You fell asleep. We took him. You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you. Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him. Believe me, everything is fine.
HEATHER=>Everything is not fine!
DR. HEFNER=>Call security.
HEATHER=>Where is he?
HEATHER=>Screw your pass!
DR. HEFNER=>It's all right, now...Ms. Langenkamp, just remain calm. Tell us how our boy is doing.
NEEDLE NURSE=>He's fine, actually. He came out of coma ten minutes ago. It's looking like acute sleep deprivation. I don't think she ever lets the kid get a night's sleep.
DR. HEFNER=>Munchausen syndrome...?
HEATHER=>What're you saying? Where is he?
JULIE=>Over here, Heather.
HEATHER=>You okay, champ?
DYLAN=>Can we go get Rex, now? The bad man's getting awful close.
HEATHER=>I know he is, sweetie. We'll both go get Rex right now.
DR. HEFNER=>I'm afraid Dylan really should stay with us until we know what's causing these episodes, Ms. Langenkamp. I'm sure you understand.
HEATHER=>Tell you what. I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now. You know home isn't far from here, right?
DYLAN=>Right 'cross the freeway.
HEATHER=>That's right. So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
JULIE=>You bet.
DYLAN=>Hurry back, please. I'm sleepy.
HEATHER=>Promise. Cross my heart. But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
JULIE=>I'll stick to him like glue, Heather. Swear to God.
HEATHER=>Hey!
HEATHER=>DO you mind...
DR. HEFNER=>Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp. For Dylan's sake.
HEATHER=>If you don't mind, I've got something more important to do than to make small talk.
DR. HEFNER=>Won't you please be patient. All of this is just routine.
DYLAN=>Uh-oh...
NURSE AT CABINET=>Would you mind stepping outside for just one moment, miss?
JULIE=>As a matter of fact, I would. What do you think you're doing?
NURSE AT CABINET=>Just a little shot to see that he gets some sleep.
JULIE=>No way. His mother specifically said...
NURSE AT CABINET=>Do it.
DYLAN=>Ow!
JULIE=>Bitch!
JULIE=>I know what's in that one. Do you know what's in this one? Or what it'll do when I stick you with it? And I will...
JULIE=>Dylan. Don't fall asleep! Dylan!
DR. HEFNER=>Ms. Langenkamp, has...there been any use of recreational drugs in your family? Or any history of mental disturbance?
HEATHER=>What the hell are you asking?
DR. HEFNER=>Please don't take this wrong. But if there was, there's a good chance Dylan could be suffering from something passed down to him. Have you been suffering from any delusional events, Ms. Langenkamp?
HEATHER=>No!
DR. HEFNER=>There are drugs and treatments, Ms. Langenkamp. We could place Dylan in foster care for a short while. Run some tests on you...
HEATHER=>I want my kid out of here now!
DR. HEFNER=>Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
HEATHER=>You don't understand. If Dylan falls asleep,then...
DYLAN=>Where's mommy? Where's...
NURSE ABBOTT=>Forget it. Nothing you can do there. Call the cops. Now!
HEATHER=>My son. Did you see my son?
DR. HEFNER=>No way he's going anywhere. He's been well sedated.
HEATHER=>He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
DR. HEFNER=>What?
HEATHER=>He sleepwalks, you idiot! He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital. Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
JOHN SAXON=>John Saxon. Do you have any idea what time it is?
HEATHER=>John. It's Heather. I need help!
JOHN SAXON=>You got it. What's happening?
HEATHER=>Dylan's run away from the hospital. I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house. But I think Freddy's after him. I know it sounds crazy!
JOHN SAXON=>You're right. That sounds crazy!
HEATHER=>John. Will you please just look for him around the hospital? I'm gonna go right to the house. Will you help me, John? Please!
JOHN SAXON=>I'm on my way. You go home, Heather. That's the smart thing to do. I'll call you there!
HEATHER=>Thank you, John. I'll never forget...
HEATHER=>Dylannnnnnn!!!!
HEATHER=>Dylan!!!
JOHN SAXON=>Holy...
HEATHER=>Where's Dylan?! Have you seen him?
JOHN SAXON=>Relax, Nancy. Relax!
DYLAN=>One two, Freddy's coming...Freddy's coming...
JOHN SAXON=>What in the world happened?
HEATHER=>I know how Chase really died.
JOHN SAXON=>What are you talking about?
HEATHER=>Fred Krueger did it.
JOHN SAXON=>Yeah, sure.
HEATHER=>You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
DYLAN=>Coming for you...
JOHN SAXON=>Hey, come outside a minute. I need to talk to you.
HEATHER=>Dylan!
JOHN SAXON=>Jesus, what the hell's going on, Nancy?
HEATHER=>John, why are you calling me Nancy?
JOHN SAXON=>Why are you calling me John?
JOHN SAXON/LT. THOMPSON=>Nancy, you gotta get hold of yourself before you make both yourself and that kid nuts.
HEATHER=>John... Would you call Robert?
JOHN SAXON/LT. THOMPSON=>Robert?
HEATHER=>Robert Englund. You know. The actor who plays Freddy?
JOHN SAXON/LT. THOMPSON=>Freddy who?
HEATHER=>You know who. Freddy Krueger.
JOHN SAXON/LT. THOMPSON=>Freddy's dead, Nancy. Now don't lose it like your mother.
JOHN SAXON/LT. THOMPSON=>I love you, sweetheart. Don't ever forget that.
HEATHER=>I love you too, Daddy...
JOHN SAXON/LT. THOMPSON=>Now get yourself some rest, Nancy... please?
HEATHER=>Dylan!
HEATHER=>Dylan?
NANCY=>Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.
LT. THOMPSON=>Yeah, sure...
HEATHER=>Dylan's sleeping pills...
HEATHER=>He's given me the only way I can join him.
DYLAN=>Mommmeeee!
HEATHER=>D...Dylan?
DYLAN=>Mommy?
HEATHER=>Dylan, where's the man?
DYLAN=>Here.
HEATHER=>What...what is that?
DYLAN=>A story?
HEATHER=>Yes. It's a story. A story for a movie.
DYLAN=>Read me some?
HEATHER=>"At last his mother finds him. She gives him a long, happy hug. And then looks at the pages. 'Story?' the little boy asks. 'Yes,' says his mother. 'A story of us.' And the mother takes the book and begins to read." "And as she begins to read, from behind her there comes...There comes..."
FREDDY=>Meet your maker!
HEATHER=>Run, Dylan!
FREDDY=>Gonna eat you up...
