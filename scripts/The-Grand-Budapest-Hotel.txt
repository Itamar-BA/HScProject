INSERT:=>The plaque. There is a block of smaller text at the bottom which states simply:
MONTAGE:=>The nine other guests of the hotel each observed from a respectful distance: a frail student; a fat businessman; a burly hiker with a St. Bernard; a schoolteacher with her hair in a bun; a doctor; a lawyer; an actor; and so on.
MONTAGE:=>The author appears pensive as he: lies in bed that night staring up at the ceiling; sits in the dining room at breakfast eating toast and gazing into space; and floats through the conservatory ignoring flora at noon. He nods to the schoolteacher sketching an orchid. She smiles and nods back.
SECOND WAITER=>Right away, M. Gustave.
M. GUSTAVE=>You want me to do it?
M. GUSTAVE=>It’s not that I don’t like it. I’m physically repulsed. Time to go! INT. CORRIDOR. DAY The procession of trunks, cases, and assistants goes in one direction, and M. Gustave, Madame D, and Zero go in the other. CUT TO: The elevator on its way down. M. Gustave sits with Madame D. on a velvet-upholstered bench. She clutches his arm and looks deeply concerned. Zero stands at attention with the jewel case alongside a veteran elevator operator.
MADAME D.=>What? Don’t recite.
M. GUSTAVE=>Good morning, Cicero. Call the goddamn plumber.
HOTEL GUEST NO.2=>This afternoon, M. Gustave?
M. GUSTAVE=>A thousand Klubecks.
MONTAGE:=>Zero pushes an old man in a wheelchair. Zero arranges a white bouquet. Zero replaces dirty ashtrays, rearranges furniture, and shields a large woman with a toothpick from view as she excavates between her teeth.
MONTAGE:=>A succession of dames of varying grandeurs seen tête-à- tête with M. Gustave: a sixty-year-old Russian chats with him in the tea salon; a sixty-five-year-old German strolls with him on the promenade; a seventy-year-old Argentinian shares a cigarette with him naked in her bed; a seventy-five-year-old Englishwoman washes his back in her bath; and an eighty-year-old Austrian wearing a hair-net and a nightgown gives him a blow-job while he watches in the mirror and eats grapes. There is a platinum wig on a stand on the dressing table.
MR. MOUSTAFA=>Because they all were.
MR. MOUSTAFA=>-- but we won’t discuss that.
INSERT:=>The front page of the Trans-Alpine Yodel. The headline is, “Will There Be War? Tanks at Frontier” -- but a column below the fold reads:
INSERT:=>A name tag pinned below a military badge. It reads: Cpl. F. Müller. M. Gustave raises an eyebrow and asks pointedly:
M. GUSTAVE=>I know exactly who you are. It’s uncanny. You’re little Albert.
HENCKELS=>It’s temporary, but it’s the best I can offer, I’m afraid.
MONTAGE:=>The cosmopolitan city of Lutz in the dead of night. A rickity Daimler taxi sputters along a winding cobblestone road at top speed. It squeezes up a narrow lane lined with shops. All are closed and shuttered. It dips into a tunnel through a brick building. It crosses a stone bridge high over a river. It drives through an iron gate, circles around a garden, and skids to a stop next to Madame D’s limousine. Up a short path, there is an enormous mansion. INT. FOYER. DAY A bell rings. Feet clack and echo on the wide marble floor. A maid in black hurries to open the front door. She is Clotilde. M. Gustave and Zero enter the vestibule
INSERT:=>Madame D’s fingernails. They are now lacquered in a rich plum. M. Gustave says, deeply moved:
M. GUSTAVE=>Oh. Well, all right. I shan’t be long, darling.
MR. MOUSTAFA=>I, myself, had never set foot inside a house of this kind in my life.
M. GUSTAVE=>I don’t see why not.
ZERO=>One-point-five.
M. GUSTAVE=>Plus room and board.
TITLE:=>Part 3: “Check-point 19 Criminal Internment Camp” EXT. PRISON. DAY A buttressed castle on a high rock spur. Clusters of tangled barbed-wire decorate the tops of the walls above a sheer cliff that drops straight down into the medieval village below. Zero stands waiting with a small pink pastry-box in his hands. There is a guard with a Tommy-gun next to him. Silence.
ZERO=>What happened?
ZERO=>I’m afraid so.
ZERO=>Don’t give up.
INSERT:=>An engraved calling card on bright, white stock which reads:
JOPLING=>You’re his sister?
M. GUSTAVE=>Good morning, Pinky.
MR. MOUSTAFA=>Well, I suppose there’s no way around it. You see, she saved us.
MR. MOUSTAFA=>M. Gustave insisted on an immediate and thorough cross-examination --
INSERT:=>A white porcelain crossed-keys pendant hanging from a velvet ribbon around Agatha’s thin neck. Agatha admires her pendant. Zero grumbles:
ZERO=>It’s not right.
INSERT:=>Four small hammers tap rapid-fire at four half-scale chisels, chipping away into a cement pot-hole. They are making good progress. INT. LUDWIG’S CELL. NIGHT M. Gustave, Pinky, Günther, and Ludwig work diligently by candle-light under a wooden table. Periodically, Wolf scoops-up the powdery debris with a soup ladle and throws it aside. Ludwig looks up suddenly, alerted. He holds up a finger.
AGATHA=>You stole -- art?
AGATHA=>Yes, Herr Mendl.
INSERT:=>A pair of high-heeled boots. Two feet quietly slip out of them and tip-toe away. CUT TO: Deputy Kovacs looking all around, frantic. Across the room, he sees:
INSERT:=>Deputy Kovacs’ hand on the knob. A second hand, wearing brass knuckles, gently enfolds it. CUT TO: Deputy Kovac’s face. He gasps. EXT. ALLEY. NIGHT The door hammers shut with a bang. Four of Deputy Kovacs’ fingers, gripping the door-frame, pop-off at the knuckles all at once and fall down into a shallow puddle. On the other side of the door, there is a scream of blood-curdling agony, then a thump, a thwhack, and, finally, a wallop. Pause. The door opens again. Jopling comes out in his stocking- feet. He puts on his boots. He takes out a handkerchief, leans down and collects the four fingers off the ground, wraps them up, slips them into his pocket, and walks away down the alley. INT. LOBBY. DAY Eight a.m. Zero, substituting at the concierge desk again, looks up to the high window across the room. Herr Becker waits alone in the storage pantry with the ledger book under his arm. He checks his watch.
M. GUSTAVE=>No safe house? Really? We’re completely on our own out here?
ZERO=>We’re brothers.
M. IVAN=>I beg your pardon. Do you prefer to walk? We’re right here.
M. GEORGES=>Get me M. Dino at the Palazzo Principessa, please.
ZERO=>Zero: confused.
M. GUSTAVE=>Give me twenty-five.
INSERT:=>A police report with a photograph of Deputy Kovacs’ body in a pharaoh’s casket with his hands crossed on his chest. A section at the bottom of the page is labelled FINGERPRINTS. There are five for the left hand, but only a thumb for the right. Jopling studies the document. He shrugs.
INSERT:=>A page of Grand Budapest Hotel stationary with a set of crossed keys insignia at the top. Hand-written below is:
ZERO=>With pleasure.
INSERT:=>The front page of the Trans-Alpine Yodel. Headline:
HENCKELS=>Where’s the basket?
INSERT:=>The radio telegram -- which has been torn to shreds, then carefully taped back together. It is speckled with blood. EXT. GAS STATION. DAY A lone fuel-pump in front of a service-shack at the foot of hill on a snowy, country road. A fourteen-year-old attendant in a greasy jumpsuit fills the tank of Jopling’s motorcycle. A sled-runner has been fitted over the front wheel. Jopling leans against the wall, silent, looking down at the radio telegram in his hands. The attendant chirps:
PUMP ATTENDANT=>Where you headed, mister?
PUMP ATTENDANT=>Three Klubecks, please.
M. GUSTAVE=>It’s a hell of a view. I give them that, for what it’s worth.
SERGE=>My dear sister.
SERGE=>I pulled a copy.
M. GUSTAVE=>Serge? Serge? Serge!
INSERT:=>A pair of high-heeled boots clamping into a pair of ski- clips.
INSERT:=>A pair of hands with brass knuckles gripping onto on a pair of ski-poles. CUT TO: Jopling exploding out the door of the shed, making a hard pivot, and launching through the monastery gate, down the steep slope. M. Gustave and Zero watch in shock. Zero turns to the display next to them. He leaps over to it, kicks-off the saint, flips-away the reindeer, and shoves the sled full-speed across the church-yard. He shouts:
MONTAGE:=>Various white-gloved hands in action: one rings a bell on the concierge desk with a quick tap. Another slips an envelope into a message box. Another picks-up a room key off a hook. Another forcefully shakes a cocktail-shaker full of ice.
AGATHA=>Compliments of Herr Mendl. For the Executive Staff.
M. GUSTAVE=>Never again shall --
INSERT:=>The needle above the elevator entrance. It climbs past Four toward Five. M. Gustave and Zero start to dash away -- but Zero stops short and turns back. He says quickly to Otto:
OFFICER=>Drop your weapon!
HENCKELS=>Who’s shooting who?
INSERT:=>The dangling package. A section of the wrapping paper has torn away, and the corner of a pale-pink envelope is visible pasted to the back of the picture. Zero stares down at Agatha, horrified. He mutters to himself:
INSERT:=>The painting, upside-down. A pair of hands flips it over to reveal the pale-pink envelope on the reverse. TITLE:
INSERT:=>The front page of the Trans-Alpine Yodel. Headline:
INSERT:=>The author’s room key as Mr. Moustafa places it onto the desk. It is labelled M. GUSTAVE SUITE.
