LT. KRAUS=>What are we going to see tonight, Willy?
PROJECTIONIST=>"Romance on the Danube," sir.
LT. KRAUS=>But we've seen that seven times. Why don't you get us a Betty Grable picture?
SERGEANT=>The car is ready, sir.
LT. KRAUS=>So soon? Well, gentlemen, I hope you have a splendid evening.
SS SERGEANT=>Identification check. Pull into line on the left.
LT. DIETRICH=>Sergeant...
SS SERGEANT=>Yes, Oberlieutenant!
LT. DIETRICH=>We are overdue in Karlstadt already with these muddy roads.
SS SERGEANT=>You can move to the front of the line, sir. The Captain can help you.
SS CAPTAIN=>Your papers.
SIGNALMAN=>Here they are, sir. Private Erich Hovlund, 7746539, the 124th infantry.
SS CAPTAIN=>Where is your unit and why aren't you with them?
SIGNALMAN=>I believe they're at Wurtzburg. I'm trying to reach them.
SS CAPTAIN=>You believe? Why haven't you reached them? I see no leave authorization.
SIGNALMAN=>I lost the company last night near Gretsburg. I took the wrong turn coming from filling my canteen and couldn't catch up in the dark.
SS CAPTAIN=>It must have been very dark. You seem to have strayed off your course for Wurtzburg. However... You seem right on course for your home in Koenigshofen.
SIGNALMAN=>No, sir. I'm trying to get to Wurtzburg.
SS CAPTAIN=>Undoubtedly, but we'll hold you for the moment until we can check with your unit. Corporal Hartl, put him in the truck.
SS CAPTAIN=>Keep them in line back there. And get the body.
LT. KRAUS=>Sad but stupid. He didn't weigh the chances. A man can't outrun a machine gun.
LT. DIETRICH=>He was obviously a deserter or else he wouldn't have run.
SS CAPTAIN=>Yes, Oberlieutenant. You wish to pass through.
LT. KRAUS=>You have an exciting job here, Captain.
SS CAPTAIN=>Yes. That is regrettable. But they think the war is over.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, we wish clearance. These muddy roads are making us late in Karlstadt.
SS CAPTAIN=>What is the nature of your business in Karlstadt?
LT. DIETRICH=>Of a personal nature, sir.
SS CAPTAIN=>I'm sorry but I must have a more explicit answer.
LT. DIETRICH=>We are going to visit the wife of a comrade, sir.
SS CAPTAIN=>Nothing to be ashamed of, lieutenant! We all need a little relaxation now and then.
LT. DIETRICH=>Do you wish to see our papers, sir?
SS CAPTAIN=>These are in order. I am sorry to have detained you, lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>Do any of you know where Elizabethstrasse 14 is?
1ST BOY=>That's it right in front of you.
2ND BOY=>Nobody is home. I wouldn't go in, sir.
LITTLE GIRL=>I went in looking for Pauli and they bit me. The rats. Two big ones.
LT. DIETRICH=>Do you know where Frau Koenig has gone? She used to live here.
LT. DIETRICH=>She was tall and dark.
LT. DIETRICH=>She had a boy, Klaus -- about your age.
2ND BOY=>Did you see him, Hans? I almost got him.
1ST BOY=>Yes, sir, I remember her! She is safe but I don't know where she lives now. We're the only ones left
LT. DIETRICH=>Can I give you some money?
1ST BOY=>No thank you, sir. No one wants it around here. Have you got any vodka?
LT. KRAUS=>You can't be over ten. You don't drink it?
1ST BOY=>Sometimes, sir. But mostly we trade it for food. The soldiers like it.
LITTLE GIRL=>We used to get turnips at the hospital but the sisters went away.
1ST BOY=>Thank you, sir.
LT. KRAUS=>That's the best Yugoslavian slivowitz. Make sure they give you a lot of food for it. Let's go.
1ST BOY=>Thank you, sir. Heil Hitler, sir!
LT. KRAUS=>They'll be all right. Children always land on their feet and forget.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, I suppose so.
LT. KRAUS=>Come... come... Paul. We need a
LT. DIETRICH=>You are drunk, Lieutenant. Your uniform is filthy. I suggest you go back inside and get yourself cleaned up.
LUFTWAFFE LT.=>Your pretty uniform may impress the girls but uniforms are going out of style quicker than German heroes. Drunkenness is in style, Herr Oberlieutenant. And your fine medals, will they get you a high position in the coming Fourth Reich?
LT. DIETRICH=>Lieutenant, you are making a fool out of yourself.
LUFTWAFFE LT.=>Go straight to hell, Herr Oberlieutenant!
JEEP DRIVER=>Shall I have him placed under arrest, sir?
LT. DIETRICH=>No, let him go. Disgusting to see an officer make such a fool of himself.
LT. KRAUS=>You're right -- but he is drunk.
LT. DIETRICH=>That is no excuse. He should know that the uniform is nothing but what the man inside brings to it.
LT. KRAUS=>Of course, Paul. Let's go inside.
LT. KRAUS=>What have you been drinking?
LISE=>Everything, and plenty of it. But that's not why I'm so happy. Four days without a bombing. And a Colonel told me the Americans are so close there won't be any more.
LT. KRAUS=>Aha! I knew there was a master plan behind our retreat.
LISE=>How close are they?
LT. KRAUS=>I don't know exactly but I heard they captured an American officer outside the Cafe, yesterday. He was nailing up a sign saying, "Off Limits."
LISE=>How can you tease about such things, Oskar?
LT. KRAUS=>Who's teasing?
LISE=>You may joke all you like but I think we're in for a hard time.
LT. DIETRICH=>You have nothing to worry about. Your talents will never go unappreciated.
LISE=>Well, well... the high and mighty Oberlieutenant Dietrich is finally joining the party.
LT. DIETRICH=>One never likes to interrupt such witty and brilliant conversation.
LISE=>We will see just how high and mighty Herr Oberlieutenant is when the Americans get here.
LT. DIETRICH=>Just what did you mean by that remark?
LISE=>Nothing, just wondering whether you plan to sell apples or sweep the streets?
LT. DIETRICH=>Go to hell you ignorant little whore.
LT. KRAUS=>Come, come, children. We are here to have a good time. Let's not spoil everything.
LISE=>I apologize, Paul. It's just that
LT. KRAUS=>Certainly... all just a big misunderstanding. Everyone's friends again. Nobody's angry. Come on, Paul, sit down.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm sorry, Lise.
LISE=>Oh, forget it. Nothing lost.
LT. KRAUS=>I propose a toast. To the three of us, Paul Dietrich, Lise and Oskar Kraus, three who have survived twelve years of madness, each in their own way!!
LISE=>I'll drink to that!
LISE=>It's really lost, isn't it?
LT. KRAUS=>Of course! And you can thank heaven for that.
LISE=>How long until the end?
LT. KRAUS=>A week, maybe two at the most. If it isn't over by then, it will be the Americans against the Russians.
LISE=>It's hard to believe it's really over. I was just a kid when it started. We were all just kids. You know what I look forward to most is soap. Soap and hot water. Scalding hot water and soap.
LT. KRAUS=>You don't have to wait until then. I have some soap and some matches. Let's go to your place and I'll give
LISE=>I'll think about that offer but right now how would you like to dance?
LT. KRAUS=>At your service, madame.
LT. DIETRICH=>Before you two love birds disappear, I want to ask Lise if she knows where Anna is.
LISE=>Anna Koenig?
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes.
LISE=>She was in here just yesterday looking for a place. She was bombed out.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, I know. Do you know where she is now?
LISE=>Yes, I think I remember. She took a room from one of the girls. Kirchenstrasse... yes, Kirchenstrasse! Number... twenty- seven.
LT. DIETRICH=>Kirchenstrasse, twenty-seven.
LISE=>That's it.
LT. KRAUS=>I'll come with you, Paul.
LT. DIETRICH=>No, please... I'd rather go myself. Besides, Lise could use a good bath.
LISE=>Has something happened?
LT. DIETRICH=>Her husband was reported killed yesterday. I have to break the news to her.
GESTAPO AGENT=>One moment, please, Lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, what can I do for you?
GESTAPO AGENT=>You are under arrest for being a party to treasonous propaganda and making defeatist and disloyal statements.
LT. DIETRICH=>You must be joking.
GESTAPO AGENT=>I assure you I'm not.
LT. DIETRICH=>But then this is completely ridiculous.
GESTAPO AGENT=>What is the name of your friend inside?
LT. DIETRICH=>What do you want that for?
GESTAPO AGENT=>Be kind enough to answer my question.
LT. DIETRICH=>I don't know who you mean.
GESTAPO AGENT=>The officer you were seated with.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm afraid I don't know him. I was just sharing a table.
GESTAPO AGENT=>And the girl?
LT. DIETRICH=>She's with him.
GESTAPO AGENT=>You have a rare wit, Herr Oberlieutenant. We shall see how it holds up at headquarters. Start walking to the corner, if you please.
LT. DIETRICH=>Wake up, Soderbaum. Come on, wake up.
DRIVER=>Back to the barracks, sir?
LT. DIETRICH=>No, I still must visit Frau Koenig. She is living at Kirchenstrasse twenty-seven. That's off the Hitterstrasse.
LT. DIETRICH=>Wait for me. I'll only be a few minutes.
WOMAN'S VOICE=>Just a moment. Who is it?
LT. DIETRICH=>It's Paul... Paul Dietrich.
LT. DIETRICH=>Good evening, Anna.
ANNA=>Paul, come in... come in!
LT. DIETRICH=>It's so nice to see you again.
ANNA=>Would you like to keep on your coat. There hasn't been any heat.
LT. DIETRICH=>That's perfectly all right. I am quite comfortable.
ANNA=>Please sit down.
LT. DIETRICH=>You're looking very well, Anna.
ANNA=>I'm afraid that's not true. But I'm lucky to have a roof over my head.
ANNA=>How did you happen to find me here?
LT. DIETRICH=>One of the girls at the Cantina told me.
ANNA=>Which girl?
LT. DIETRICH=>Oh, little Lise.
ANNA=>Yes! I know her.
LT. DIETRICH=>You were bombed out.
ANNA=>Yes, fortunately it was a daylight raid and we weren't home. I was taking little Klaus to the doctor.
LT. DIETRICH=>How is little Klaus?
ANNA=>He is much better now but he had a terrible cough. It kept him awake at night for a week. You know how hard it is to get any medicine or find a doctor.
LT. DIETRICH=>Where is he now?
ANNA=>He is sleeping in the other room. Would you like to see him?
LT. DIETRICH=>If it won't wake him up.
ANNA=>Nothing wakes him! He sleeps through the bombings.
LT. DIETRICH=>He's a wonderful boy.
ANNA=>Yes, and so much like his father.
ANNA=>Why have you been such a stranger lately?
LT. DIETRICH=>My duties at the base have kept me very busy.
ANNA=>You and Klaus are such good friends. We talk of you often.
ANNA=>You are here because of Klaus, aren't you? Something has happened.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, he is dead. I'm sorry, Anna. I should have been more direct.
ANNA=>It was not difficult to guess the purpose of a visit at this hour.
LT. DIETRICH=>I am terribly sorry, Anna. You have my greatest sympathy.
ANNA=>Yes, it's tragic. But I've been expecting the news ever since he left five days ago.
LT. DIETRICH=>Then you were prepared?
ANNA=>Yes, one must. In these times one must be prepared for anything.
LT. DIETRICH=>I know what Klaus must have meant to you.
ANNA=>Klaus dead... I almost can't believe it.
LT. DIETRICH=>You must remember, he was a brave man he died defending the Fatherland.
ANNA=>The Fatherland! What does it matter now? Klaus is dead.
LT. DIETRICH=>In these times such men don't live to an old age.
ANNA=>But what will I do now? What will I do without him?
LT. DIETRICH=>Anna... you must listen to me. I am proud of Klaus and you should be too. Death is not such a tragedy. We will all be dead. A few years more or less should not be that important. What is important is that he died honorably.
ANNA=>That's easy for you to say.
LT. DIETRICH=>I don't expect you to understand now but someday you will.
ANNA=>Someday. That's the day we all wait for. Let's have a drink.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'd like to, but I'm afraid I must be leaving. If there's anything I can do --
ANNA=>I wish you wouldn't leave just yet.
LT. DIETRICH=>Well, I guess I can stay for a while.
ANNA=>I have some Steinhager left. Is that all right?
LT. DIETRICH=>Excellent.
ANNA=>Water?
LT. DIETRICH=>Nothing, thanks.
ANNA=>That's the way I like it too.
LT. DIETRICH=>To the memory of Klaus.
ANNA=>At least you are one of the lucky ones.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, I am one of the lucky ones.
ANNA=>Another drink!
ANNA=>Oh, please. Just one more.
LT. DIETRICH=>All right.
ANNA=>To the future.
LT. DIETRICH=>To the future.
ANNA=>Talk to me about something.
LT. DIETRICH=>What would you like to talk about.
ANNA=>Oh, I don't know. Tell me a funny story.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm afraid I have a very poor memory for jokes.
ANNA=>It doesn't matter! Let's have another drink.
ANNA=>Oh, don't be so stiff! Take your hand away.
LT. DIETRICH=>This must be the last one. My driver is sitting outside in the cold.
ANNA=>Well, send him away.
LT. DIETRICH=>Then how will I get back to the base?
LT. DIETRICH=>It doesn't run at night.
ANNA=>Then you can take it in the morning.
LT. DIETRICH=>Oh, that's impossible. I have no place to spend the night in town.
ANNA=>But you can spend it here if you like.
LT. DIETRICH=>I couldn't very well do that.
ANNA=>I don't know why.
LT. DIETRICH=>No, it wouldn't be right.
ANNA=>Of course you could.
LT. DIETRICH=>No, that's impossible.
ANNA=>Before you go then, one dance. And no excuses!
LT. DIETRICH=>All right.
ANNA=>You don't have to be afraid. I won't break.
ANNA=>That song brings back a lot of
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, funny how music can do that to you.
ANNA=>You must think I'm a terrible person.
LT. DIETRICH=>Don't be silly.
ANNA=>You do. I know that. But then there's so much about Klaus and myself you don't know anything about.
LT. DIETRICH=>Well... yes... I suppose there is.
ANNA=>You'd really be surprised if you knew.
LT. DIETRICH=>I suppose every marriage has its secrets.
ANNA=>Paul, I want you to make love to me.
LT. DIETRICH=>What?
ANNA=>I want you to make love to me. I want to feel a man in my arms.
LT. DIETRICH=>You must be drunk.
ANNA=>Oh, do you think a couple of drinks has loosened me up? Paul, take me in your arms and do anything you want.
LT. DIETRICH=>If you're not drunk, you must be insane.
ANNA=>What's the matter. You like women don't you?
LT. DIETRICH=>That has nothing to do with it.
ANNA=>I think it has everything to do with it. I like men and you like women. The rest is rather simple, don't you think?
LT. DIETRICH=>Don't be disgusting. You know what I mean.
ANNA=>You mean we must respect the dead?
LT. DIETRICH=>If you enjoy putting it that way.
ANNA=>I'd much rather have you take pity on a poor widow.
LT. DIETRICH=>Anna!
ANNA=>Shall I tell you a secret?
LT. DIETRICH=>I've had fifty men better than you this year.
LT. DIETRICH=>Are you proud of that?
ANNA=>I'm not ashamed of it.
LT. DIETRICH=>Did Klaus know?
ANNA=>I was unfaithful, but I wasn't cruel.
LT. DIETRICH=>He never suspected?
ANNA=>I made him completely happy.
LT. DIETRICH=>You're disgusting.
ANNA=>You don't have the right to be so
ANNA=>Ha, ha, ha, ha... you've proven your manhood. Bravo, you men are all the same.
ANNA=>Now, come to bed!
LT. DIETRICH=>What do you think this is all about?
CAPT. ABTMEYER=>They are going to pull us back.
COLONEL VON SPERLING=>Please remain as you were, gentlemen.
COL. VON SPERLING=>I don't think it is necessary to go into detail about the present situation on the West Front. The Fuehrer has promised us victory and we all have, I'm certain, the fullest confidence in the wisdom of his efforts.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Three days ago, in the retreat from Obernburg, an important railway bridge spanning the Main River was ordered destroyed. Our engineers did not have sufficient time and the bridge was captured by the Americans. They are pouring supplies and motorized units across the bridge 24 hours a day. We have received the order to destroy that bridge.
COL. VON SPERLING=>We got the order in about midnight. I had you aroused as soon as von Bredow had worked out the details. We drop a special force of 50 men tonight by parachute. Captain Abtmeyer, you will lead the mission.
CAPT. ABTMEYER=>Sir, if I can speak my mind?
COL. VON SPERLING=>Certainly, Captain.
CAPT. ABTMEYER=>This mission is suicidal and futile. Not only will it drop the group almost in the middle of the American Third Army but for absolutely no purpose.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Yes, go on, Captain.
CAPT. ABTMEYER=>It surely can't have escaped you, sir, that the war is no more than weeks from ending. I can only consider this mission a tragic joke that will kill off my entire group.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Captain, I do not doubt your courage. You have proven it many times before. However, I want you to consider carefully what I say. This mission was ordered by our superior headquarters; I make no value judgments on orders I receive. I see that they are carried out to the best of my ability and the full resources of my command. I expect you to make no judgments and do the same. This mission is assigned to your group and I order you to carry it out.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Pause a moment and consider all the possibilities, Abtmeyer. Don't let a late night of drinking and a ready mouth get you in trouble. This is no joke.
CAPT. ABTMEYER=>I realize the full seriousness, Colonel. And I again refuse this order. This is a unique situation in special times.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Call in the guards.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Men, you are witnesses; give your names to Major Gosswald afterwards. Captain Abtmeyer, you have refused a direct order. I consider this a special situation... the refusal of an order under combat conditions.
COL. VON SPERLING=>I sentence you to be shot immediately. Major Gosswald, I order you to carry out this sentence as soon as possible by the most humane means.
MAJOR GOSSWALD=>Fall back outside. Will you please come with me, Captain?
COL. VON SPERLING=>That is an unfortunate beginning. Oberlieutenant Dietrich, I'm putting you in charge of the mission. You are the only man left who is capable of commanding such a daring and dangerous assignment.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, sir. May I ask a favor of the Colonel?
COL. VON SPERLING=>Certainly, Dietrich.
LT. DIETRICH=>May I ask the Colonel to reconsider his execution order for Colonel Abtmeyer? He has been a brave officer for three years in our outfit. It is not difficult to understand a man's courage breaking under such a strain.
MAJOR GOSSWALD=>Fire on my command. Aim for the chest and fire a short burst of about five rounds. Ready...
MAJOR GOSSWALD=>Aim...
MAJOR GOSSWALD=>Fire.
LT. KRAUS=>Tragic... unnecessary... to go through the whole war and come to an end like that.
LT. DIETRICH=>And such a brave officer.
LT. KRAUS=>At least he might have been a little more clever about it.
LT. DIETRICH=>He obviously didn't expect to be shot.
LT. KRAUS=>He knew it was suicide to go. I guess he just decided to gamble on von Sperling's kindness.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, well -- I guess there's nothing anyone can do about it now. And I think we'd better get going. We've got lots to do.
LT. KRAUS=>Paul, I'm not going along on this and neither are you!
LT. DIETRICH=>What? You must be crazy.
LT. KRAUS=>On the contrary.
LT. DIETRICH=>Do you want to be shot like Abtmeyer?
LT. KRAUS=>I don't intend to be.
LT. DIETRICH=>What are you going to do? Hand in your resignation to von Sperling?
LT. DIETRICH=>You'd get as far as the first checkpoint and they'd hang you from a tree.
LT. KRAUS=>Remember the time we hid for a month dodging Russian patrols. We could strike out cross country and just stay in the woods a few weeks until the Americans come.
LT. DIETRICH=>I couldn't do something like that.
LT. KRAUS=>Why in hell not?
LT. DIETRICH=>It would be running away and leaving someone else to do my lousy job.
LT. KRAUS=>Paul, don't talk like a child.
LT. DIETRICH=>I would never be able to face myself again.
LT. KRAUS=>This is not the time for Wagnerian poses.
LT. DIETRICH=>Whatever my personal sentiments may be, I am an officer. I swore an oath of allegiance. It is my duty to obey this order.
LT. KRAUS=>Duty... duty to whom? To the madmen who have brought nothing but shame and ruin to our country?
LT. DIETRICH=>Oskar, we are friends. There is no one closer to my heart than you. I would give my life for you. But there is no point in trying to prove you are right to me. I will do whatever I can to help you but I cannot go with you.
LT. KRAUS=>You agree it's suicide to go?
LT. DIETRICH=>I would feel the same way if I did, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.
LT. DIETRICH=>You know, it wouldn't be the same this time without you along.
LT. KRAUS=>That's true, then only one of us would be killed.
LT. DIETRICH=>At least you haven't lost your sense of humor. Look, if you've really made up your mind not to go --
LT. KRAUS=>Don't be silly. You know I couldn't let you win all the glory alone. Besides it will look better being shot by the Americans than by the SS.
FIRST SOLDIER=>They're going to drop us on Washington and we're going to hold the American government for ransom.
SECOND SOLDIER=>Let's drop on Paris instead. There are a couple of other things I'd like to hold for ransom while we're at it.
THIRD SOLDIER=>That's only fair. They held you up for a pretty high price the last time.
FIRST SOLDIER=>I wish it was Berlin. We could end this damn war in a hurry with a couple of grenades introduced in the right government circles.
SECURITY TEAM SERGEANT=>Close the line up and keep it quiet.
LT. KRAUS=>Blecke, Corporal, machine gunner... Light Machine Gun and pistol.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Do you have the sub-machine gun there?
SUPPLY CLERK=>Right, sir.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Ten magazines SMG ammo; two magazines pistol ammo.
LT. KRAUS=>Give him two magazines of ammo for the pistol and 250 rounds for the MG.
SUPPLY CLERK=>Check, sir.
DEMOLITION TEAM SERGEANT=>Keep the noise down out there. The lieutenants can't read from the lists.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Two 150 foot lengths of climbing rope, fifteen snap links, fifteen pitons, piton hammer...
LT. KRAUS=>Schreiber, Corporal, assistant gunner... pistol and two magazines of ammo.
SUPPLY CLERK=>Check, sir.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Mohring, Corporal, demolitions man... twenty pounds plastic explosive, Torbite A-2...
SUPPLY CLERK=>Explosive... check, sir.
LT. KRAUS=>Three boxes, LMG ammo... 750 rounds.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Cap box with ten percussion caps, crimper.
ASSISTANT LMG GUNNER=>750 rounds?
SECURITY TEAM SERGEANT=>What's the matter, Schreiber? Too heavy for you?
ASSISTANT LMG GUNNER=>This must be the big winter offensive we've been waiting for, sergeant.
LT. KRAUS=>Keep the noise down, Sergeant Kohler.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Ten feet time fuse and two fuse lighters.
LT. DIETRICH=>Carry on... carry on with the work.
LT. DIETRICH=>It's 1220. How close are you to being finished?
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>I think we're both about three-
LT. DIETRICH=>Leave your sergeants in charge and tell them to finish up here in a hurry.
LT. KRAUS=>What is it?
LT. DIETRICH=>I don't know. Colonel von Sperling wants to see us.
SECOND SOLDIER=>Did you see that demo equipment and climbing gear. Maybe we're finally going to invade Switzerland.
SECURITY TEAM SERGEANT=>Next man, move up.
LT. DIETRICH=>D Group officers reporting as ordered, sir.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Stand at ease, gentlemen.
COL. VON SPERLING=>There is a Gestapo agent outside checking on a murder of another agent last night in Karlstadt. This agent was last seen following an officer of this command from the Cafe Wein. He was found outside in the morning with his chest crushed
LT. DIETRICH=>I believe I may be responsible, sir.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Please be responsible in a softer voice, Lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, sir. An agent from the Gestapo tried to arrest me last night as I was leaving the Cafe Wein. In the resulting fight I may have been responsible for his death.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Why did he want to arrest you?
LT. DIETRICH=>He accused me of making politically disloyal statements.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Gosswald... Major Gosswald.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Please show in Herr Grauschmidt.
MAJOR GOSSWALD=>Yes, sir.
HERR GRAUSCHMIDT=>I see you waste little time, Colonel von Sperling.
HERR GRAUSCHMIDT=>The colonel explained to me that you are preparing for a mission and that your time is tightly scheduled.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Your time is valuable also, I suspect, Herr Grauschmidt. I'll get right to the matter. It is as I suspected...
COL. VON SPERLING=>Yes. It is as Capt. Abtmeyer admitted prior to his execution this morning. These officers left him in the canteen or immediately outside it. Lt. Dietrich tells me that Abtmeyer was not himself and was showing him a propaganda leaflet. The fact that he refused a direct order this morning indicates that he was under a severe mental strain.
HERR GRAUSCHMIDT=>Thank you, Colonel. I am extremely sorry but I shall have to file a full report on this.
COL. VON SPERLING=>As you wish, Herr Grauschmidt.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Do not mistake my lie just now for sentimentality. As an Army man I have no love for the Gestapo, and I
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, sir.
COL. VON SPERLING=>You may go.
LT. DIETRICH=>D Group, attention.
COL. VON SPERLING=>At ease, men.
COL. VON SPERLING=>You may begin the briefing, Lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>We were just starting, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>All right, give me your attention. D Group has been selected for a night parachute drop and a bridge demolition in the Obernburg-Main River area. Take-off will be at 1900 hours and the drop at 2100. There will be three planes with twenty men in each.
LT. DIETRICH=>Pay attention to this. Especially you, Masserman. The last jump you had to ask directions from the Russians.
LT. DIETRICH=>This is what the drop zone looks like. The planes will fly from East to West. The assembly area is in the south-east corner on the high ground here. The sergeants will show you all the aerials afterwards. I want a rapid, silent assembly. It will be night and the darkness will give us a big edge in surprise.
LT. DIETRICH=>The drop zone is about eight kilometers from the target bridge so that if we lose security, it won't disclose the objective. Here's the way it looks. The sergeants have maps and will show it to you afterwards. The Main River runs here. Sort of North-South. The bridge is here. Near Obernburg. The drop zone is north of the bridge and on the east of the river, here. It should take us not more than three hours to get from the drop zone to the bridge. Here are the enemy dispositions in the bridge area.
LT. DIETRICH=>That's part of the American Third Army rear echelon and mobile reserve. But they've got bigger things on their minds than us. We've got a small enough group to slip through and a big enough one to handle anything coming our way.
LT. DIETRICH=>The bridge spans a deep ravine and the lower abutments are sunken into the face of the rock walls about two hundred feet above the bottom of the ravine. This is in our favor since we believe the bridge is only guarded from the top. By day the area below can be well protected from the high vantage point and by night it is assumed the rock walls are impossible to climb. Our job is going to be to show the Americans what we learned in our Alpine weekends.
LT. DIETRICH=>When the mission has been completed we will infiltrate our way back through the lines in small groups. Do you have anything to add, Colonel?
COL. VON SPERLING=>No, Lieutenant. You did an excellent job. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all the best of luck.
LT. DIETRICH=>Following this briefing, each squad will be briefed in detail by their squad leaders. Then there will be hot rations. I guarantee no ersatz ersatz. We will chute up in one hour and fifteen minutes.
LT. COLONEL=>Is this the latest?
RADIO OPERATOR=>Yes, sir. That's the special report you requested.
LT. COLONEL=>I want a report every thirty minutes and a special report if there is any sudden change.
COL. VON SPERLING=>What is it, Colonel Bleuler? Has the weather changed?
LT. COLONEL=>I'm afraid so, colonel. The weather on the drop zone will be affected by
COL. VON SPERLING=>Let me know immediately if the weather changes.
LT. COLONEL=>Yes, sir. We'll continue the briefing and put the planes on standby.
SERGEANT=>First Plane: Assault Team One, Demolition One. Move into the hanger.
FIRST SOLDIER=>The German Army is the only army that holds formations for organized sleeping in ranks.
SECOND SOLDIER=>Your outlook has cheered up with this postponement. Your jokes are almost funny.
THIRD SOLDIER=>Postponement. He thought the lieutenant said cancellation and this was a formation to sleep out the rest of the war.
SERGEANT=>A little quiet so they can hear the instructions. Second Plane: Assault Team Two, Security Team One.
MAJ. VON BREDOW=>Back again. You must have some interest in the weather.
LT. DIETRICH=>I just have a natural curiosity.
MAJ VON BREDOW=>Still weathered in with change expected "momentarily."
COL. VON SPERLING=>Damn their momentary change. If they delay the thing any more, we'll be fighting the Americans for the airstrip. What exactly did the report say?
MAJ. VON BREDOW=>It said exactly, sir, "No change. Weather front moving east. Change expected momentarily."
LT. DIETRICH=>Are you awake?
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>I'm awake.
LT. KRAUS=>What is it? Are they ready?
LT. DIETRICH=>No change.
LT. KRAUS=>Hell, it's almost 0300. If it gets much later, it'll be canceled. They won't drop us in daylight. They're not completely insane.
LT. KRAUS=>Pure Austrian weather. Rain off the mountains.
ORDERLY=>Colonel von Sperling would like to see you, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm coming right away.
LT. DIETRICH=>You sent for me, sir.
COL. VON SPERLING=>You can get your men ready, Lt. Dietrich. The weather has cleared in the drop zone. It's 0624 now. Station time will be 0650 and take-off at 0700.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, sir.
COL. VON SPERLING=>There are undoubtedly many disadvantages. But at least they won't be expecting any attack and especially in daylight.
LT. COLONEL=>I can't believe, Colonel von Sperling, that you plan to go through with this mission in the daylight.
COL. VON SPERLING=>Colonel, my instructions were to destroy this bridge; nothing was said as to the proper time of day! Instruct your pilots to re-plot for a one-leg pass at the drop zone with a low level approach at 250 meters. If they hedge-hop, they shouldn't be much bothered by ground fire or fighters. Station time is 0650 and take-off at 0700 hours.
COL. VON SPERLING=>You will probably lose security before you reach the bridge. Reroute so that the Americans won't discover the objective by plotting your route.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>Sergeants, reform the men into their plane loads. And move them over to the trucks to draw chutes.
LT. KRAUS=>They can't be meaning to drop us now.
LT. DIETRICH=>They are flying a straight route to the drop zone. Drop altitude 250 meters. You won't need reserves. Have the men leave them by the planes. Have them in the planes at 0650. Take-off ten minutes after. Make sure you tell your plane loads the new route azimuths.
LT. DIETRICH=>Good luck. See you on the drop zone.
FIRST SOLDIER=>I wish von Sperling was on this trip. I'd like to stick this knife in his ear.
SERGEANT=>Throw the reserves over there. We won't be needing them at 250 meters.
SECOND SOLDIER=>250 meters. We don't need a chute... Just a long ladder.
THIRD SOLDIER=>Just before you hit, jump up.
SERGEANT=>Put them on.
FLIGHT CHIEF=>Do you want the bell and the light, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>Right, Chief. Have the pilot check them out.
FLIGHT CHIEF=>The jumpmaster wants a bell and light check, sir.
PILOT=>Right, Chief.
LT. DIETRICH=>Bell, checked out.
LT. DIETRICH=>Red light, all right.
LT. DIETRICH=>Green all right. Everything is in good shape, Chief. We'll be loading in a couple of minutes.
SGT. STANGE=>All chuted up, Lieutenant. I've got your chute right here.
LT. DIETRICH=>Thank you, Sergeant Stange.
SGT. STANGE=>How is the fit, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>Too small as usual. Buckle that belly band, will you? Get it good and tight. I almost fell out of the last one.
LT. DIETRICH=>That's got it. Let's check out the men and then load. We've got six minutes to station time. You start
SGT. STANGE=>Right, Lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>You've got that pretty loose, Fromm.
FIRST SOLDIER=>I like it loose, sir. Then when it opens, I know it's there.
LT. DIETRICH=>Don't fall out; you'll scare the spectators. All set.
SECOND SOLDIER=>Any word on the wind, Lieutenant?
THIRD SOLDIER=>The wind... Hell, worry about how you're going to open a tank with a pair of wire clippers.
LT. DIETRICH=>All set, Hassebrauk. Don't worry, Corporal Vollmecke, you take a tank in each hand and crack them like nuts. We'll get the wind reading from the pilot in the plane.
SGT. STANGE=>All set, up to here, Lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>Lead them on, Sergeant Stange.
LT. DIETRICH=>Chief, let me have a verbal at twenty minutes and another at ten. The red light at four minutes. A one minute and the green and the bell together. Got that.
LT. DIETRICH=>Get the wind reading from the pilot for me as soon as he gets it.
FLIGHT CHIEF=>Yes, sir. Maybe he's got something now.
SGT. STANGE=>How much longer, Lieutenant?
LT. DIETRICH=>It's hard to tell, Sergeant Stange. Probably another thirty minutes.
SGT. STANGE=>It's hot as hell back there. I'm going to try a little air.
FLIGHT CHIEF=>Plugged in back here, Captain. Minus twelve.
LT. DIETRICH=>Stand up and hook up.
LT. DIETRICH=>Check your equipment.
LT. DIETRICH=>Sound off on check.
SGT. STANGE=>Number 20, check.
FIRST SOLDIER=>19, check.
LAST SOLDIER=>All check.
SOLDIER ON GROUND=>Cut loose the MG, Willy.
SOLDIER IN TREE=>All right, here it comes.
LT. DIETRICH=>Demo team move straight back in. Lt. Bruggemann will put you in position. Move out... Move out. How many are we missing, Sergeant Stange?
SGT. STANGE=>About fifteen, sir. Most from the security team.
LT. DIETRICH=>Damn. Security team?
FIRST SOLDIER=>Yes, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>Where's Lt. Kraus and those two machine guns?
FIRST SOLDIER=>I don't know, Lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>Move out along the edge about fifty meters. Corporal Muench is down there.
LT. DIETRICH=>No tanks yet, Corporal Vollmecke?
LT. DIETRICH=>I'll send this gun down. Go back and pick up the other one. Hurry along anybody you find.
LT. KRAUS=>All right.
LT. DIETRICH=>Move your gun on about twenty meters to the head of that gully.
LT. DIETRICH=>What's the final count?
SGT. STANGE=>All here, Lieutenant. Except Kraeling. Had to leave him hanging.
LT. DIETRICH=>How about the wounded?
SGT. STANGE=>Fromm won't make it with both legs broken. The man who fell from the tree broke his elbow. Kraus has set the bones.
LT. DIETRICH=>Leave Fromm with some food, but get his SMG. Send me up two point men.
LT. KRAUS=>Right.
LT. DIETRICH=>Keep it at 115 degrees until I change it. And check each other. And don't shoot unless you have to.
LT. DIETRICH=>Flank left for one hundred meters. Keep the area covered but don't fire.
LT. DIETRICH=>Tell them not to return fire and to keep moving. Pass it along.
LT. DIETRICH=>Go down and take a look. Get me an azimuth.
LT. DIETRICH=>One thing's certain. We don't cross any roads on the planned course.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>According to the map we should reach the gully very soon.
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes.
LT. KRAUS=>Those damned Luftwaffe pilots dumped us on the wrong drop zone. We're lost.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Those navigators couldn't find their way up a rope.
LT. KRAUS=>I thought that drop zone looked different. As if it wasn't bad enough before -- now we don't even know where we're going.
LT. DIETRICH=>Take Stange and form two groups for road crossing with one MG in each. Take them down by the road.
LT. DIETRICH=>What are you thinking about, talking like that in front of those men.
LT. KRAUS=>They know we are lost without me telling them.
LT. DIETRICH=>It's your job to set an example for them. You're not going to let me down, are you?
LT. KRAUS=>I don't think it's necessary for you to ask me that question.
LT. DIETRICH=>
SGT. STANGE=>That must be an entire mechanized division and its artillery.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Think you could handle it, Sergeant Stange?
SGT. STANGE=>That's the way we were in Russia.
LT. DIETRICH=>Move along the lines Sgt. Stange. Tell the men to stay put and keep still. Have the second group face up-hill.
LT. DIETRICH=>Hurry up.
LT. DIETRICH=>We're not going to be here long, sergeant. First, get security out. Then I want a complete status report on dead, wounded and missing. Also on any significant ammo shortages.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>I've got that prisoner over here, Lieutenant Dietrich.
LT. DIETRICH=>Nothing here. He's Corporal Robert John Scott, 323rd Reconnaissance Company. It's on these orders here. Serial 17147358. Protestant. Money. Photo of girl friend. Photo of a dog. Looks like a Weimaraner. I used to have one. Letters from home.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>He can tell us where we are.
LT. DIETRICH=>I am aware of that, Bruggemann.
MEDIC=>All done, sir. He'll be all right.
LT. DIETRICH=>Good morning, Corporal Scott. Feeling pretty under the weather, I suppose.
CORPORAL=>I'm not complaining.
LT. DIETRICH=>You'll find everything untouched.
CORPORAL=>Thanks.
LT. DIETRICH=>I must pay you a compliment, corporal.
LT. DIETRICH=>Very few men would have been able to experience what you have just gone through with as few ill effects as you have.
CORPORAL=>I wish my lieutenant could hear that.
LT. DIETRICH=>Like a cigarette?
CORPORAL=>Thanks.
LT. DIETRICH=>Don't say it. I admit your American cigarettes are much better but they are rather difficult to buy just now.
CORPORAL=>Say, I know you're supposed to be asking the questions but do you mind if I ask you one?
LT. DIETRICH=>Certainly not. Besides, please don't regard this as an interrogation.
CORPORAL=>Well then, what in the hell is going on -- another invasion?
LT. DIETRICH=>I should say happily not. We were cut off from our outfit in the retreat Wednesday and we're trying to make our way back.
CORPORAL=>Why don't you guys just call it a day?
LT. DIETRICH=>We have our orders just like you. We're just trying to stay alive until the war ends.
LT. DIETRICH=>Well, not just yet, corporal. Though I thank you for your offer.
CORPORAL=>What are you going to do with me?
LT. DIETRICH=>Oh, you're free to go any time you want to. We obviously can't take you with us.
CORPORAL=>Do you mean that?
LT. DIETRICH=>You have my word, corporal. But there's just one favor I'd like to ask.
CORPORAL=>What is it?
LT. DIETRICH=>This won't be anything to compromise the American war effort, I assure you. We are leaving behind our seriously wounded and we'd like to get them medical attention as soon as possible. They will be your prisoners, of course.
CORPORAL=>Well, that's a new twist.
LT. DIETRICH=>How's that?
CORPORAL=>I mean okay, Lieutenant. Okay.
LT. DIETRICH=>Some of them are badly hurt. How long do you think it will take you to bring help back?
CORPORAL=>The battalion aid station is about four miles up the road. I guess I can walk there in an hour and come back with some transport pretty quick.
LT. DIETRICH=>That sounds wonderful, corporal. I
CORPORAL=>Don't worry about that. They'll get the best.
LT. DIETRICH=>Fine... fine. You know, it's amazing there's anything left of our towns. You Yanks really did a thorough job on them.
CORPORAL=>Yeah, that's true.
LT. DIETRICH=>Say, I just happened to remember. I hope that town isn't Obernburg. The last I heard from out regimental headquarters is that artillery had that scheduled for a heavy concentration.
CORPORAL=>No, Obernburg is north of here. The hospital's safe enough. It's in a little dinky village called Mungersdorf.
LT. DIETRICH=>Thank you very much, Corporal Scott. I'll have my sergeant help you get ready for your journey.
CORPORAL=>Okay, Lieutenant. I've got to say you've been a good Joe. When the war's over, if you ever come to Detroit, look me up. I'm in the phone book.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'll certainly do that.
LT. DIETRICH=>Let's see a map. I should have been in an intelligence interrogation section. I'd be a major by now. Mungersdorf. I though so. It's
LT. DIETRICH=>And here's our present position on this hill two kilometers west of the road.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>It's 1300 now. We should make the river by not later than 1700.
LT. KRAUS=>Well, has our American told us how to get to the Obernburg bridge yet?
LT. DIETRICH=>In one day you seem to have lost all the experience you have gained in four years of war.
LT. KRAUS=>I'm sorry, Paul. I wasn't thinking. I was careless.
LT. DIETRICH=>That's fine! What are we supposed to do with the prisoner now?
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>We certainly can't release him.
LT. KRAUS=>Well, I guess we'll have to take him along with us.
LT. DIETRICH=>Don't add stupidity to your carelessness. That would be impossible. We will have to shoot him.
LT. DIETRICH=>I suggest you lower your voice. You have made enough trouble already.
LT. KRAUS=>There must be another way.
LT. DIETRICH=>I am only doing what is necessary to protect the lives of our own men.
LT. KRAUS=>Paul, in the name of God, don't do it.
LT. DIETRICH=>Your carelessness is the cause of the prisoner's death just as well as the bullet that kills him.
LT. DIETRICH=>Oskar, try to regain control of your nerves. Try to remember you are an officer. Try to remember I am in command.
SGT. STANGE=>The men are in a perimeter, Lieutenant. I've got an outpost down the slope towards the road. We've got fifty men not counting yourselves. Six wounded.
LT. DIETRICH=>Re-form the men to move out.
SGT. STANGE=>Yes, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>Form a detail of two men and stay with the prisoner until we move out. When the last man gets out of sight, shoot him. When you return say that
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Yes, sir. If I may, sir, I suggest you keep an eye on Lieutenant Kraus. I don't feel very safe with him any more.
LT. DIETRICH=>When I need your advice, Lieutenant, I'll ask for it. Carry out your orders.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Yes, sir.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>The prisoner tried to attack us and we had to shoot him.
LT. DIETRICH=>Kraus, take three more of your men and move forward with the point as an advanced guard. We will move down the gully to the river. It should be about eight kilometers.
LT. DIETRICH=>One moment. I have too much respect for you as a soldier to believe you will allow your personal feelings to interfere with your duty to your men.
LT. KRAUS=>I hope I don't disappoint you.
LT. DIETRICH=>Get those three MG teams up here quickly.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Why doesn't Kraus open up?
LT. DIETRICH=>We will see whether you can do it better. Take that number one MG and move up to Kraus. I want to hear the heaviest volume of fire since Stalingrad. I'm taking Stange and the other two. We'll move up on the left. When you see a smoke grenade lift fire and move on down the gully.
LT. DIETRICH=>That damn thing sweeps the whole
LT. DIETRICH=>There isn't any other approach to the bridge.
LT. DIETRICH=>We'll have to take that house.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Get it firing. Get up and fire your weapons.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Fire, damn you, fire. Don't worry about those damn Americans. Fire. Fire.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Why the hell didn't you open fire?
LT. KRAUS=>What does it matter? They've got us pinned down and blocked from the river. We have no other way.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Shut up, damn you. I would kill you here if you weren't the chosen friend of Lt. Dietrich. Stay there and sweat.
LT. DIETRICH=>Get that damn MG up. Get it up.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm moving out now. Keep up the fire until you see the smoke grenade. Make sure we leave the rear of the house clear for them to retreat. Give me your grenades.
SGT. STANGE=>Good luck, Sir.
WOUNDED SOLDIER=>Lieutenant, they are leaving the house by the rear. I saw first three and then five more run out into the orchard.
LT. DIETRICH=>Let them go. You sit here.
LT. DIETRICH=>Fall back into the gully. Get moving. Fall back.
LT. DIETRICH=>Sgt. Stange, get those MG's back. Displace to the gully.
SGT. STANGE=>Take those guns and let's go. Come on.
LT. DIETRICH=>We will have to clear that ford before they get organized and that smoke blows off. I want you to use the four assault men and form a rear guard.
SGT. STANGE=>I'll make it hot for them if they follow us in the gully.
LT. DIETRICH=>We must have fifteen minutes for reorganization.
SGT. STANGE=>I'll guarantee you that, Lieutenant.
SGT. STANGE=>They're firing from up in that damn orchard.
LT. DIETRICH=>They haven't spotted us yet. They are still covering the house. Let's get moving. Allow us a hundred yard start. MG teams, move out. The riflemen are with Sgt. Stange.
GERMAN RUNNER=>Sir, Sergeant Stange says the rear guard is being pressed hard by about two squads from the farmhouse.
LT. DIETRICH=>Tell Sergeant Stange to keep falling back. We'll be waiting for him.
GERMAN RUNNER=>Yes, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>Let's see what they know about us.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Shall I come with you?
LT. DIETRICH=>No, better get everyone ready to move out. And redistribute the ammo.
LT. DIETRICH=>Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable, Lieutenant -- Foote?
LT. FOOTE=>Well, a perfect gentleman.
LT. DIETRICH=>I can understand your bitterness at being wounded, Lieutenant Foote.
LT. FOOTE=>Say, that's mighty decent of you.
LT. DIETRICH=>If I may, I would suggest you do not waste your strength in anger.
LT. FOOTE=>Why don't you go to hell?
LT. DIETRICH=>It might be an improvement. Would you like a cigarette?
LT. FOOTE=>Okay.
LT. DIETRICH=>Are you in great pain?
LT. FOOTE=>Only when I laugh.
LT. DIETRICH=>Very witty. I hope I can make jokes when my time comes.
LT. FOOTE=>You're not the type. A heroic pose would be more your stuff.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm sorry it had to happen this way, Lieutenant Foote.
LT. FOOTE=>C'est La Guerre, Herr Oberlieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>You chaps almost had us back there at the farmhouse.
LT. FOOTE=>C'est La Guerre... C'est La Guerre.
LT. DIETRICH=>I guess you were tipped off about us.
LT. FOOTE=>Is that a question?
LT. DIETRICH=>No, of course not. We're just having a conversation.
LT. FOOTE=>Okay, Lieutenant Andrew Foote, serial number 6787345, United States Army. I'm a very poor conversationalist.
LT. DIETRICH=>Come, come Lieutenant. We've treated you decently, haven't we?
LT. FOOTE=>You mean before or after you shot me?
LT. DIETRICH=>Look, your wound may be serious. You probably haven't much time. Why not be decent about it?
LT. FOOTE=>Okay, here's come decent advice. Find the nearest American soldier and surrender. Every rear echelon unit has been alerted to your presence. I don't know what you fellows think you're trying to do but in case you haven't heard. The war is lost. And in case you don't know which side lost it -- yours did. Now why don't you put your toys away like good little boys and... go... home.
LT. KRAUS=>He's right, Paul.
LT. DIETRICH=>How do you know?
LT. DIETRICH=>Maybe you were philosophizing too loud.
LT. KRAUS=>Paul, what's happening to you?
LT. DIETRICH=>You ask me that question.
LT. KRAUS=>Perhaps my nerves are gone but I'm not blind.
LT. DIETRICH=>But I suppose I am blind.
LT. KRAUS=>This is the end, Paul. It's not suicide to go on. It's murder. Germany is finished. These men have families that will need them after the war. The only thing that matters now is rebuilding what is left so that our children may have a chance for peace and happiness that we never had. The bridge doesn't matter. It never did.
LT. DIETRICH=>Oskar, my friendship has permitted you to indulge in this orgy of self- pity and self-righteousness. My patience is at an end. You will either conduct yourself properly from this moment on, or you will have to face the consequences.
LT. KRAUS=>Would you have me shot, Paul?
LT. DIETRICH=>I threatened nothing specific.
LT. DIETRICH=>Form up your section. Your behavior is jeopardizing the security of the mission.
LT. KRAUS=>The security of the mission! You don't give a damn about getting everyone killed. The only thing you care about is that the great, the noble, the heroic Lieutenant Dietrich always completes his mission. It's not courage. It's just that you're more afraid of failing than you are of getting killed.
LT. DIETRICH=>Lieutenant Oskar Kraus, by the authority vested in me by the Third Reich, I order you to form up your section, at once.
LT. KRAUS=>But the pistol, Paul. What is the pistol for?
LT. DIETRICH=>Don't drive me too far!
LT. KRAUS=>You mean you wouldn't want to shoot me?
LT. DIETRICH=>Oskar, I beg of you. Come to your senses.
LT. KRAUS=>And I beg of you -- come to your senses.
LT. DIETRICH=>For the last time, are you going to
LT. KRAUS=>I am afraid you will have to shoot me.
LT. DIETRICH=>Very well, if you wish to surrender you may stay here with the wounded.
LT. KRAUS=>No! If you leave me here, I will tell everything I know about the mission. It cannot be long until more Americans arrive.
LT. DIETRICH=>What in heaven's name do you want?
LT. KRAUS=>You must either shoot me or give up the mission.
LT. DIETRICH=>Oskar, I warn you not to overplay your hand.
LT. KRAUS=>You think I'm bluffing?
LT. DIETRICH=>This has gone on long enough. Sit down over there and be quiet.
LT. KRAUS=>I'm not bluffing. I swear to tell everything if you leave me here.
LT. DIETRICH=>You're leaving me absolutely no choice.
LT. KRAUS=>Fine. Let's see then whether you have the courage to shoot me yourself.
LT. DIETRICH=>Form up the patrol and move out.
LT. KRAUS=>If you can't do it yourself, just order it done.
LT. KRAUS=>Bruggemann will do it, won't you Bruggemann?
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm sorry, Oskar. You know I won't harm you. Please, I beg of you, come to your senses.
LT. KRAUS=>You were perfectly right. It is I who should apologize.
LT. KRAUS=>Don't worry about me anymore. I still think you're crazy but I won't cause you anymore trouble.
LT. DIETRICH=>I knew you wouldn't let me down.
LT. DIETRICH=>I think this side is the easier one. A four cut should drop that end neatly in the gorge.
LT. DIETRICH=>How many climbers are left?
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Mandel is the only one still with us but his hand is badly smashed.
LT. DIETRICH=>Well, it looks like you and I will have to manage alone, eh, Peter?
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>We can do it.
LT. DIETRICH=>Good. Get the rope and explosives collected.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>At once.
LT. DIETRICH=>Set up the perimeter. Keep an eye out for that patrol. If they come back while we're still up in the bridge open fire on them. Give us as much time as possible.
LT. DIETRICH=>You too.
LT. DIETRICH=>Place the two upper charges. I'll wire the opposite lower one and then tie in the two upper ones on the way back here.
LT. DIETRICH=>Give me the timer.
LT. KRAUS=>Everything go all right?
LT. DIETRICH=>Like a weekend in the Alps.
LT. DIETRICH=>Who as responsible for that?
DEMO MAN=>I don't know, sir.
LT. DIETRICH=>Very well, we'll check into this later. You may go.
DEMO MAN=>Yes, sir.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>What do you think?
LT. DIETRICH=>I think we put enough up there to do the job.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>I'm sure we did.
LT. KRAUS=>Shall I move the men out?
LT. DIETRICH=>We'd better.
AMERICAN VOICE=>Halt! Who goes there? Dammit.
LT. KRAUS=>Kamerad.
AMERICAN SOLDIERS=>Keep them up, Krauts. Everybody stand and throw down your guns.
SOLDIER=>Keep them up, Kraut. Uppen ze. Hey, Lieutenant... Look what I got here. Uppen ze, Kraut.
LIEUTENANT=>How are those wounds, sir.
LIEUTENANT=>We looked it all up and down, Captain. Not a damn thing.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Yeah. How's Anderson.
LIEUTENANT=>Dead.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Well the makes two, Anderson and Shrewsberry, that got it on this damn hacked up patrol. Let's go question that Kraut lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm sorry to see you are wounded, Captain.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Sorry I can't say the same thing, Lieutenant.
LT. DIETRICH=>That is your privilege, Captain.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Okay, Krauthead, let's skip the bull.
LT. DIETRICH=>Pardon me?
CAPTAIN JONES=>Let's get to the facts!
CAPTAIN JONES=>Skip that -- what were you doing down here?
LT. DIETRICH=>We were trying to kidnap General Eisenhower.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Was it just a coincidence we found two explosive packs near the bridge?
LT. DIETRICH=>We were going to blow him up.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Don't get fancy with me, Krauthead! You were after the bridge, weren't you?
DIETRICH=>What does it matter now? We were after the bridge.
CAPTAIN JONES=>I thought so! Listen, did you actually think you could do it with those two charges?
LT. DIETRICH=>I beg your pardon, sir. But those explosive packs are a new plastic type equal to ten times their size in normal explosives.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Funny I hadn't heard of that. Tell me, thought, did you actually think you could scale those cliff walls in the dark?
CAPTAIN JONES=>Okay, lieutenant, you've been very cooperative.
LT. DIETRICH=>Why not sir. My silence will not win the war for us. What does it matter now? You do not understand us. We are a reasonable people.
CAPTAIN JONES=>It's going to take me a little time until I get used to the new model talkative Kraut type.
LIEUTENANT=>You can have 'em all, sir.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Okay, let's move 'em out and get these supermen topside.
GUARD=>Sitten ze here.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>How much time to go?
LT. DIETRICH=>About ten minutes.
LT. KRAUS=>At least we ought to warn them to clear the bridge.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>If we do that they can send someone
LT. KRAUS=>I still think we should warn them.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>Say, what happened there, Bill?
CAPTAIN JONES=>Nothing much. I'll go back to the battalion aid station later.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>You should watch out for that. Could get infected.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Sure, sure, I'll take care of it.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>Lieutenant Powers just briefed me. You'll probably get the bronze star for this one. Nineteen prisoners. Imagine, they tried to blow up this bridge!
CAPTAIN JONES=>That's what the big cheese lieutenant said. But, you know, there was something fishy about that guy.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>There's something fishy about all those guys.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Yeah, but this one was special.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>(doesn't take it
CAPTAIN JONES=>I don't think it's possible -- and yet --
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>Lieutenant Powers said you found the explosive.
CAPTAIN JONES=>We found two packs which they claim was some new powerful stuff big enough to do the job --
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>But maybe it was just left over from what they wired into the bridge.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Our engineers claim a fly couldn't crawl up those cliffs at night -- and yet you can't be sure.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>Do you realize what you're saying?
CAPTAIN JONES=>It's just a hunch.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>Well, why not interrogate again?
CAPTAIN JONES=>I think I'll do that... but first I think we ought to stop the traffic over the bridge.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>What?! I can't do that on a hunch! Why, do you realize the schedule I've got to keep up. We're ten hours behind already. The colonel will be on my tail for a month if I ever closed the bridge on some wild scare.
CAPTAIN JONES=>After what's happened, just think where you'll be if that damn bridge blows up lined with trucks wheel to wheel.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>You're right. You're absolutely right! The lives of those men are much more important than any schedule. But I'll only stop it for a few minutes. Long enough to talk to those prisoners again.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>How much time now?
LT. DIETRICH=>Any second now -- less than a minute.
LT. KRAUS=>They're stopping the trucks! They must have found out.
LT. DIETRICH=>Impossible! How could they know?
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>What's the difference? How much time?
LT. DIETRICH=>Any second.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>It's late! Dammit, it's late!
LT. DIETRICH=>Impossible. It's foolproof. I know these timers, they can be late but they always fire.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Maybe we didn't wire it properly.
LT. DIETRICH=>Don't worry. I checked everything. It will go off. It's only late.
LT. KRAUS=>Look, two officers coming over.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Keep your mouth shut!
GUARD=>Okay, you guys, everyone on their feet. Uppen ze on ze feets.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Lieutenant, we know the bridge is wired and ready to go. I want one of your men to volunteer to climb down with some of our engineers to show them where you placed the detonator.
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm sorry, sir. But I must claim my privilege to refuse that order under the prisoners rights section of the Articles of War.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Then you admit the bridge is unsafe?
LT. DIETRICH=>Captain, the bridge is perfectly safe. I simply cannot allow my men to risk falling off the superstructure in the dark.
CAPTAIN JONES=>What have you got to say?
LT. KRAUS=>I agree with Lieutenant Dietrich, sir.
CAPTAIN JONES=>And I suppose you do too.
LT. BRUGGEMANN=>Naturally, sir.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>Listen, we're not going to get anywhere with you blowing your top. He is within his rights to refuse your order.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Rights? Why he's lucky to be alive.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>Sure, Bill. But blowing your top is not going to solve our problem. Why don't we just send some of our engineers down for a look? I don't know how long I can keep this bridge closed.
CAPTAIN JONES=>That's kind of a tough thing to ask in the dark. And my guess is if they have wired the bridge they wouldn't time it to go off much later than one hour. That would put it right about now.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Listen, I've got one more idea that should prove this thing either way.
GUARD=>Okay, Lieutenant. Have your men follow me.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Okay, lieutenant, now I have an order for you that is not within your privilege under the Articles of War to refuse.
LT. DIETRICH=>I am at your service, sir.
CAPTAIN JONES=>You understand we are going to send you back to prisoner of war camps?
LT. DIETRICH=>Yes, sir.
CAPTAIN JONES=>You understand that prisoners are often driven back in trucks?
LT. DIETRICH=>That's really service, sir. We expected to walk.
CAPTAIN JONES=>No, you'll be driven in nice, new, comfortable trucks. But we have a system here for doing things. You have systems too in the German army, don't you?
LT. DIETRICH=>Certainly, sir.
CAPTAIN JONES=>Well, our system is that the prisoners assemble in the middle of the bridge to wait for pick up by truck.
CAPTAIN JONES=>We even trust you enough to let you march your men out there without a
LT. DIETRICH=>I'm not sure I understand what you want me to do.
CAPTAIN JONES=>It's very simple. Just march your men out to the middle of the bridge. Stop them there. And wait for the truck to come by and load you in.
LT. DIETRICH=>Come, come, sir. This is all really rather childish, isn't it?
CAPTAIN JONES=>A prisoner of war refusing an order may be shot on the spot. I order you to march your men out to the center of the bridge to await transportation.
LT. DIETRICH=>Certainly, sir. I have no intention of refusing your order.
LT. DIETRICH=>Men, we are going to be loaded into trucks. Form up in a column of twos and on the command follow me!
LT. DIETRICH=>You are all probably thinking the bridge may go up any second. It could but I don't think it will. When those timing detonators are late they are usually much later than this one is now. If we refuse to stand on this bridge for a few minutes they will know what we did and immediately send some engineers down to find the detonator. They may find it in time and all our work will have been in vain.
LT. DIETRICH=>We have a nice crowd of spectators. We'll show them what a German soldier is made of. Don't worry, the Americans won't keep us here very long. They're not really sure the bridge is wired, and this will prove it to them.
LT. DIETRICH=>Now I want all of you to find a place to sit comfortably. I want you to find positions that look like you're out for a Sunday picnic. Some one of you lean over the rail. Four of you sit down and play cards. The rest stand in groups of two or three chatting.
LT. DIETRICH=>Boys, we've been through a lot of tight spots together. This will be the last one, either way. The war is over and what the hell are we going to do with ourselves anyway? This moment will last you all your lives. You will tell your grandchildren about it, and they will tell theirs. At this moment we are living like a few men have ever lived. A man can almost thank God he has a moment like this.
MAJOR SULLIVAN=>Well, Bill, I guess this wraps it up. Let's get things moving again. The trucks are really piling up.
CAPTAIN JONES=>One last thing. I want to see how they come back.
CAPTAIN JONES=>All right, Lieutenant, bring your men back.
LT. DIETRICH=>Keep quiet. Don't move. I want no hurrying. We will form up just as we came out. You will follow my tempo. When we get off the bridge make no comments, no sighs of relief. Nothing to indicate anything out of the ordinary.
LT. DIETRICH=>We're going to sing a song.
MAN'S VOICE=>Hurry up with those letters. The four o'clock truck is here soon.
LT. DIETRICH=>Excuse me, Herr Bauer.
