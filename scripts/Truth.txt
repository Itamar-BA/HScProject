MARY=>I'm up for this.
ANDREW HEYWARD=>He is, among other things, a piss poor speller. That's why the Houston Chronicle put him on the radio instead of a desk. Three years later, he was their news director.
ANDREW HEYWARD=>To call his beginnings humble would be generous. A graduate of that most notable of journalism schools, The Sam Houston State Teacher's College, in 1959 he took his first job in the burgeoning medium of television. A year later, when a hurricane hit Galveston, he convinced his cameraman to shoot the radar screen, showing Americans for the first time how a storm worked. He was the first journalist to report that John F. Kennedy had been shot. He described the Zapruder film in detail to a nation that was not allowed to see it. He became the White House Correspondent at 33 years of age and the Chief London Correspondent a year later. He helped bring the horrors of the Vietnam War into American living rooms for the first time.
ANDREW HEYWARD=>At a Broadcaster Convention in 1974 where President Nixon was scheduled to appear but not take questions, he, of course, asked a question. Nixon, upset, asked "Are you running for something?" My friend politely replied "No, sir, Mr. President. Are you?"
ANDREW HEYWARD=>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my friend, and the reason I have this job, Dan Rather.
JOSH=>What's she like?
MARY=>Old Texas Pol.
BURLY SECURITY GUARD=>Sir, we have to ask you to leave.
SMITH=>Belisario Flores?
MARY=>Killian's dead.
LUCY=>Tom Honeycutt...
MARY=>We don't do that.
SMITH=>How early are we?
COLONEL CHARLES=>Her mother died. Right in the middle of it. So this story never got finished and the election happened. An election decided by 537 votes.
BETSY=>What's it running?
COLONEL CHARLES=>We need to find that "th"...
MARJORIE CONNELL=>Number one, he would not have typed because he did not type. Number two, the wording is very suspect to me. I just can't believe that this is my late husband's words-
GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS=>CBS is still standing by its story and in fact they're also pointing to another source, a Colonel Robert Hodges, who was an immediate superior to Mr. Killian.
DAN=>Critics claim typewriters didn't have that ability in the 1970s. But some models did.
DAN=>I did not, sir.
GENERAL HODGES=>It says a highly placed CBS source referred to me as your trump card-
MARY=>You- Excuse me?
GENERAL HODGES=>They do. But I hadn't physically seen them-
GENERAL HODGES=>I'm just telling you I now believe the memos are forgeries-
BURKETT=>I was supposed to copy the documents inside and then burn the originals, which were also copies, and the envelope. Destroy the DNA evidence of where they come from, you see.
BURKETT=>So the first day at the show, a dark skinned fellah comes up, hands me an envelope, walks away. Inside are those memos. I burned the rest like he said. Done and done.
MARY MURPHY=>What are you doing here?
WOMAN=>It's no big thing.
RADIO HOST=>So this is a pattern of hers?
MARY=>That's not fair.
MARY=>So. Do you believe me?
MARY=>I can't do both?
HIBEY=>You have one chance here. Among all the conservative lawyers on the panel, there is one former journalist. One man who can maybe understand what happened. You convince him... maybe he can turn the rest of them.
HIBEY=>There's just opinion...
LARRY LANPHER=>Well, what would you say?
MARY=>That's not true.
COLONEL CHARLES=>You ever need a reference...
