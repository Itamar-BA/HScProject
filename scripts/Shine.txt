SUZIE=>Can I come when you do?
RACHEL=>It is for his father to decide.
RACHEL=>He is just a boy, Mr. Rosen. He still wets the bed.
SUZIE=>Show me Daddy, show me where the lion scratched you when you worked at the circus.
RABBI=>See you next week David, and don't forget to study. We'll see you in Schul, Elias.
MRS. BOKSER=>Mr. Helfott, it's exciting isn't it? David, the Lord Mayor's dying to meet you.
SECRETARY=>Thank you Comrade Helfgott; your son is a credit to you.
GIRL=>You play beautifully.
GIRL=>My name is Sonia.
SONIA=>I know who you are.
SONIA=>You have the most wonderful hands.
SONIA=>You're going to America?
KATHERINE=>You must be very proud of him.
KATHERINE=>I have a long-suffering old piano at home.
SUZIE=>I wonder if they've got a cadillac?
SUZIE=>Read it again.
SUZIE=>Just the bit about the parakeet and the dog and the two cats.
RACHEL=>Why now!? Why!?
KATHERINE=>Perfect; I'll treasure it until the day I die.
KATHERINE=>Are you full?
KATHERINE=>Each time you play 'Sospiro' it expresses so completely� the inexpressible.
KATHERINE=>It's divine.
KATHERINE=>A new story - drops of water.
KATHERINE=>Listen. It's the wind.
KATHERINE=>To you, all these wild weeds and wind flowers of my life. I bring my lord and lay them at your feet.'
KATHERINE=>Bravo, David.
KATHERINE=>He was forever busy in his study. 'Go away, Kattie, I'm writing,' he'd always say. One day, I was very young, I got so annoyed I emptied the inkpots all over his desk and I scrawled on his work, pages of it. When he saw it he stood there seething with anger; I could feel it.
KATHERINE=>There was this terrible silence. I just stared at him and said, 'Go away, daddy, I'm writing.'
KATHERINE=>He ran at me and picked me up, and cuddled me breathless. My first literary effort he always called it.
KATHERINE=>What is it? David?
KATHERINE=>The Royal College of Music. A scholarship. David that's marvelous!
KATHERINE=>He can't stop you, David.
KATHERINE=>I'll miss you.
KATHERINE=>These were for my son but he left home before I could give them to him.
KATHERINE=>You'll need them. It gets very, very cold in London.
SUZIE=>No -
RACHEL=>Stop it! Stop it!
SUZIE=>David!
PARKES=>It's fortunate I'm a deeply forgiving human being.
PARKES=>Bacchanalian! Boldness of attack!
PARKES=>Diablerie! The Devil, David!
PARKES=>Liszt broke plenty!
PARKES=>But you must play what's on the page; you're not Liszt, remember.
PARKES=>Come on, fill in for this useless arm of mine.
PARKES=>The notes first, your interpretation comes on top of them.
PARKES=>You agree, do you?
PARKES=>Is that wise?
PARKES=>Don't forget, it's on the page.
PARKES=>You mustn't sacrifice everything to emotion. It's a question of balance.
PARKES=>Precisely.
SARAH=>Thank you, David.
REGISTRAR=>Mr. Helfgott. Your allowance cheque.
ROBERT=>Pay day. David!
ROBERT=>You missed the bank. Pity! You'll have to wait until tomorrow.
ASHLEY=>'Love' dear David.
RAY=>Got a cigarette, love?
RAY=>I'm Ray.
RAY=>You're very friendly, aren't you David?
PARKES=>He has the most fantastic hands.
PARKES=>He's a little fragile.
PARKES=>I've seen enough to suggest he can make the finals of the concerto trials.
VINEY=>And what have you seen, Cecil?
PARKES=>Moments of genius.
VOICE=>David!
IRWIN=>Is he aware of what happened? Does he remember?
IRWIN=>Do you remember much from your student days, David?
IRWIN=>That performance he gave for the concerto finals, Rachmaninov's Third. I'll never forget it; I doubt anyone could.
ROBERT=>How on earth did we manage to make the finals, dear David?
ASHLEY=>You're a conductor's nightmare.
ROBERT=>What are we going to do?
PARKES=>Are you sure?
PARKES=>The Bach' 3? It's monumental.
PARKES=>No one's ever been mad enough to attempt the Rach' 3.
