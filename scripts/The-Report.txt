SENATOR FEINSTEIN=>Thank you. I now yield the floor to the Senator from Arizona.
MCCAIN=>This question isn't about our enemies; it’s about us. It’s about who we were, who we are, and who we aspire to be. It’s about how we represent ourselves to the world. Our enemies act without conscience. We must not.
