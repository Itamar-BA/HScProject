RETURN TO ME=>a.k.a.
DISTANCE CALLS=>by Bonnie Hunt and Donald Lake
BOB=>It's a shame we have to put roofs on 'em.
MIKE=>Okay Bob, have fun tonight.
BOB=>As always...
CHARLIE=>Katherine... Katherine? I knew I'd find you here... Hey, Sidney... I need your signature to change the Polar's diet... And it's already five, I'll check in on the calf. You go home and get ready.
KATHERINE=>Oh, thanks Chuck. Bob's picking up my dress... I have stockings... I have to take Mel to the park for a quick run, my hair, make-up...
CHARLIE=>See what this lady does for you, Sidney?
KATHERINE=>Look at him Charlie, we'd go nuts in a place this small...
CHARLIE=>I know... But we're getting there. Pour on the guilt during your speech...
KATHERINE=>I intend to. Who're you bringing tonight?
CHARLIE=>Haven't decided yet. Still got two hours.
BOB=>I know you're hungry...
KATHERINE=>Hi, my baby, you're such a good boy. Oh, I know, I love you too.
BOB=>Hey, Babe.
KATHERINE=>Hey, honey. It's pouring out. You get my dress?
BOB=>Yep, and I took Mel out.
KATHERINE=>In your Tux? Your pant legs are soaked.
BOB=>Yeah. Tell Mel to eat.
KATHERINE=>Mel honey, eat.
BOB=>You spend all day with an Ape, what do you expect?
KATHERINE=>As you can see in this photo of Sydney, he is sometimes "too much" like man.
KATHERINE=>Over the last ten years, Sydney has become part of the family. Here, he's showing his flash cards to my husband. My husband is the one on the left.
KATHERINE=>Tonight, I was hoping I'd be able to announce that we've reached our financial goals for the expansion we so desperately need, but unfortunately, we were not awarded the grant.
CONDUCTOR=>Thank you, Dr. Rueland. Now ladies and gentlemen, tonight's very special guest, Mr. Tony Bennett!!!
TONY BENNETT=>Thank you very much. I'm thrilled to be here tonight. It's an honor to be a part of such a noble effort on behalf of the animals. The boys and I have worked up a little something special for you...
MEGAN=>Is it most important that a man is, A: Polite to your family and friends? B: Can handle finances well? Or C: Will take care of you when you are ill? Well, I guess your answer is definitely C.
GRACE=>Rosebud.
MEGAN=>Very funny.
GRACE=>I just want some water.
MEGAN=>Would you like me to bring the check or will you be ordering dessert?
GRACE=>Megan, you can go home, y'a know.
MEGAN=>To what? I don't have cable, you do.
GRACE=>What about Joe and the kids?
MEGAN=>He likes me more when I'm not around. And the kids like me a lot more after they've been alone with Joe. It's good for him to be with the kids when they're coming down from the sugar. He usually fuels 'em up and then they go through de-tox on my shift.
DR. SENDERAK=>Ladies...
GRACE=>Hey, Dr. Senderak.
DR. SENDERAK=>You're about the same, hematocrit 16, SMA 20... Some things are a bit low but that's to be expected. We're entering borrowed time. The most important thing now Grace is rest, you need to rest. I'll see you tomorrow.
MEGAN=>Doctor, why don't you give her your heart? You're not using it.
DR. SENDERAK=>Good evening, ladies.
GRACE=>Megan.
MEGAN=>What? I wish he'd do...something.
GRACE=>He can't. Even if a heart's available, they won't give it to me. I just have my Grandpa pressuring them. I have no husband, no children. I may never get a heart.
MEGAN=>Listen, Tin Man. You've got me. I'm pressuring them.
GRACE=>Thanks, Meg.
MEGAN=>You'll get a new heart and before you know it, you'll be back in your garden, you'll be painting... You'll be getting asked out by the most fantastic men...
GRACE=>I'm getting a new heart, not a new ass.
MEGAN=>My point is, you'll be out doing things you were never able to do, riding a bike... Traveling, painting in Europe...
GRACE=>It's too late, Megan. I'm too old. I'm twenty-seven. My mother's heart gave up by twenty-five. I've been sick too long... Promise me you'll take care of my grandpa...
MEGAN=>Twenty-seven is not old. I'm thirty-three...four...five -- whatever. Do you consider me old?
GRACE=>Yes.
BOB=>Excuse me... Excuse me... Pardon me...
MR. BENNINGTON=>Bob. Bob Rueland!
BOB=>Oh, hi Mr. Bennington, I didn't see you or I would have stopped and said hello.
MR. BENNINGTON=>Katherine's speech was wonderful. I suppose she told you about the sizable donation Mrs. Bennington and I gave this year... Anonymously of course.
BOB=>Of course... Very generous, as always. I'll let Katherine know you're here...
MR. BENNINGTON=>We also gave quite a chunk to some rain forest gimmick.
BOB=>Really?
MR. BENNINGTON=>Next thing I know, we're on Safari. Cute story... The Mrs. and I are out in the boonies...
BOB=>Hey, Chuck!
CHARLIE=>Bob... Mr. Bennington... She loves this song... Aweemaway-Aweemaway-Aweemaway-Aweemaway... I'll catch you later...
BIG HAIR=>I'm going to run up and put on a little more lipstick...
BOB=>Is that possible?
CHARLIE=>I'll go with you...
BIG HAIR=>To the ladies room? Silly.
BOB=>Wait, Charlie, you have some news for Mr. B. here, don't ya?
CHARLIE=>I don't have any...
BOB=>I'm sorry. I shouldn't have ruined the surprise. It's because of your donation and all... Charlie's putting a picture of you up in the monkey house.
MR. BENNINGTON=>Really? Thank you, Charlie.
CHARLIE=>Well, it was just a thought, I'd have to run it by Katherine. She's the boss.
BOB=>You two obviously have a lot to discuss...
CHARLIE=>Uh-huh.
MEGAN=>Close your eyes, rest. I'll read you to sleep or tell you about my day, either one'll knock you out.
GRACE=>I don't want to sleep.
MEGAN=>You heard what Dr. Congeniality said... You need to rest.
GRACE=>Fine, I'll rest but I don't want to sleep.
MEGAN=>Okay.
GRACE=>I want to stay awake. I'm afraid to sleep.
MEGAN=>Then we'll stay up.
KATHERINE=>Hey, stranger. Celia, Mike, you know my husband, Bob.
MIKE=>You keep designing those high rises, we won't be able to see the lake.
BOB=>Well, that's my evil "master plan".
MIKE=>We were just telling Katherine about our place in Italy.
BOB=>Ah, Italy, I thought your "get-away" was in St. Barts?
CELIA=>It is. This is our vacation place.
BOB=>My mistake. Well, I'd take Italy any time of the year.
KATHERINE=>Don't start.
BOB=>We were supposed to go there for our honeymoon. But we didn't think Sydney could tolerate the flight.
KATHERINE=>I promise we'll go to Italy.
BOB=>Well that's big. That's a promise. I'll take that.
MIKE=>Where are you vacationing this year?
BOB=>We're going to one of those water theme parks for the weekend.
CELIA=>...that'll be nice.
KATHERINE=>He's kidding, Celia.
CELIA=>That's funny.
BOB=>Well, I promised Katherine we'd dance tonight, so if you'll excuse us.
KATHERINE=>I'm not dancing to "In The Jungle" so forget it.
BOB=>Fine, then the next dance. C'mon, you can stand on my feet.
MR. BENNINGTON=>So I grab the spear and she grabs her hot rollers...
BIG HAIR=>I have those...
KATHERINE=>We really needed that grant.
BOB=>I know, honey. I'm sorry. Smile.
KATHERINE=>Aren't you upset for me?
BOB=>Of course I am. I just hate seeing you disappointed. So stop it.
KATHERINE=>Poor Sydney... Another year in that little space...
BOB=>You promise me Italy, I promise Sydney a new home.
KATHERINE=>Bob...
NURSE=>Female, thirty-four. Car accident. No seat belt. Hit on right side; head trauma. EMS said she was unconscious at the scene. B/P 90 over 40. Pulse is erratic. Respirations, 10.
BOB=>You're going to be fine, honey. You're going to be fine... Kay, can you hear me? Honey? You're going to be fine.
NURSE=>80-40 and dropping. She's taching.
BOB=>You're going to be fine, Kay...
BOB=>What's happening? I love you, Katherine.
DOCTOR#1=>5 mg of Epi, stat.
NURSE=>Does she have any allergies:
BOB=>No.
NURSE=>I'm sorry, you're not allowed in the operating room.
MARTY=>Adiamo! While it's hot... ANGELO!
ANGELO=>I got it.
MARTY=>I already took me mittens off!
ANGELO=>I already served 'em.
MARTY=>Grace. Oh my soul! I'm on me way!
ANGELO=>Can I say hello?
MARTY=>Blessed be God. Saints be praised. Call everyone!
ANGELO=>Ciao, Grace... You gotta heart, huh? That's a-nice. I hope it's a big one!
NURSE=>Okay, sir, calm down. We need to get you to the emergency room.
MARTY=>It's pomodoro sauce.
GRACE=>Grandpa, if I don't make it...
MARTY=>You'll make it. I prayed for the heart, you gotta it. Now we'll pray that it fits.
GRACE=>I love you. Thank you for always taking care of me.
MEGAN=>No...
MARTY=>I'm not going to tell you I love you now, I'll tell you when you come out.
GRACE=>Okay, Grandpa.
MEGAN=>I love you.
GRACE=>You don't think I"m going to make it?
MEGAN=>No, of course not. I just...you're my best friend... I love you. There, I said it again, that'll cancel out the first one. And I love you Doctor and you Nurse lady... There, feel better?
GRACE=>Pray, Grandpa.
MARTY=>I love you.
CHARLIE=>You're sure you don't want me to stay?
BOB=>I have to take Mel out.
CHARLIE=>He's been out. I left the hospital a few hours ago and came by, took him to the park...
BOB=>Oh, yeah...
CHARLIE=>I'm going to stay.
BOB=>No, please, go home. I really just need to be alone.
CHARLIE=>Bob, I don't know what to say.
BOB=>Thanks.
CHARLIE=>Okay...
MEGAN=>Thomas-Martin-Dayton give me that! Okay, get your coat, Daddy's taking you home. JOE!
JOE=>What? Geeze.
MEGAN=>Get the kids home! It's one in the morning.
JOE=>I'm going, I'm going. C'mon Tommy, get your brothers.
TOMMY=>I want to stay and see the new heart.
JOE=>We'll see it when she comes home.
ANGELO=>Megan, where's Marty:
MEGAN=>Is he with my Dad?
MARTY=>He can't sing.
ANGELO=>Then how come he's got such a big band?
WALLY=>To drown him out.
EMMETT=>Hey, Wally, stay outta this. How many famous Polish singers are there?
WALLY=>I have two words for you; Bobby Vinton
EMMETT=>Three words; Mister-Bing-Crosby.
ANGELO=>He beat his kids.
EMMETT=>Doesn't mean he couldn't sing. Sinatra beat up everybody.
ANGELO=>Frank didn't. His people did.
MARTY=>Dean never hit anyone.
WALLY=>Only Jerry. But he was asking for it.
ANGELO=>Point is, we got Frank, Dean, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Pavarotti, Mario Lanza - how much time you got?
WALLY=>Grace, you want me to take you kids to the zoo in the Caddy?
GRACE=>Thanks Wally, we're riding our bikes.
EMMETT=>Settle something for us, best male singer?
GRACE=>Dean Martin.
ANGELO=>Frank.
MARTY=>Dean.
ANGELO=>Pavarotti.
EMMETT=>Bing.
WALLY=>Bobby.
MARTY=>Grace it's been over a year. You can hardly see 'er anymore.
GRACE=>Nice try, Grandpa.
MARTY=>You're beautiful, lassie, no one'll notice y're chest.
GRACE=>Thanks a lot.
ANGELO=>Outta respect, we should mention Sammy. I mean, he only had one eye.
EMMETT=>He was Irish, ya know.
WALLY=>You mean Jewish.
EMMETT=>Whatever...something didn't fit.
ANGELO=>That was his gimmick. All the greats had 'em.
BOB=>We needed that cement poured yesterday!
JEFF=>I had to wait on the welders.
BOB=>Why?
JEFF=>I'm at their mercy, Bob. You know that.
BOB=>Yeah...I'll be there by three. Uh-huh...
JEFF=>Bob, my guys worked eighteen hours yesterday!
BOB=>At time and a half, I'm crying for ya.
MIKE=>For Christsakes, you have the best guys working here. You don't want them walking.
BOB=>I don't give a shit, Mike.
MIKE=>Bob, you have to slow down. You're working too hard.
BOB=>Yeah, well... Whatever. You should quit smoking.
MIKE=>I have. Several times.
BOB=>Rueland... Hey, Charlie... It's just wasted space right now... Tell them, it's only an extra fifty feet...towards the Lion House... Yeah well they told us we couldn't have the waterfall and the pipes are being laid for that... Then I'll tell 'em...
JEFF=>You want more mortar thrown in there tomorrow?
BOB=>You don't know the answer to that? What? I'm walking over right now.
MIKE=>Don't forget, you're on Wabash at three o'clock. New beams going in.
BOB=>Yep.
TOMMY=>Aunt Grace, are you okay?
GRACE=>Yes. Whatever it was, it didn't hurt.
MEGAN=>It probably fell out of the stroller... His dolphin...
GRACE=>I'll go look for it.
MEGAN=>No, I'll do it.
MEGAN=>Excuse me, I'm sorry... If that isn't yours, I think I know who it belongs to.
GRACE=>They should have more space. Hi, Sydney.
JOEY=>Look Mom, he likes us.
MEGAN=>Doesn't he remind you of Daddy?
GRACE=>He's so sweet.
BOB=>First of all, artificial trees are not "planted"... And why build a tree when two real trees are already there?
BOB=>So why stop now? C'mon guys, it's just fifty feet...and we can build around the Oak trees, real-full-grown-sturdy Oaks coming right out of the top of the structure. All that from just fifty extra feet.
BOB=>Ohmigod, Guys, you're a Zoo. Isn't it better for the gorillas to have a "real" tree? Charlie?
CHARLIE=>Yes, definitely...
BOB=>Because I seriously doubt the gorillas would even know how to sell the souvenirs, then there's the training involved...the computer registrar, time-cards...
BOB=>Guys here's the deal. My wife wanted this building up two years ago. So the way I look at it, we're already behind schedule. You give me that fifty feet so I can build around the real trees and I'll finish the job within the month so you can have it open at the beginning of summer.
BOB=>And I'll personally design and build a souvenir shop that'll fit in the space that's left...
CHARLIE=>Wow.
BOB=>Did they know that was going to happen?
CHARLIE=>Game.
BOB=>Nope...
CHARLIE=>Just have a beer with the guys once, don't worry, none of them will talk to you, they all think you're nuts...
BOB=>You're sure you won't have some women "accidentally" joining us.
CHARLIE=>I did that once...twice. But I won't tonight, because Friday night, I have someone very special...
BOB=>Forget it, Chuck.
CHARLIE=>She has a great body. An attorney. Great body, very attractive, great body... I'd date her myself but I was with her sister once...
BOB=>Uh-huh...
BOB=>I'm a dog person...
CHARLIE=>Oh that's nice, just walk away, go ahead, run away... I'm your only friend--you know that? I'm trying to help you...
BOB=>You want to help me, Charlie--stop trying to 'help' me... Let me at least enjoy my heartache...
CHARLIE=>What kind of twisted argument is that?
BOB=>And stop being such a jerk at the zoo.
CHARLIE=>What?
BOB=>Don't just stand around, speak up. Initiate something. Fight one of the battles. You want to help me, Charlie? Then help me get it done--for Katherine.
CHARLIE=>Then what?
BOB=>Danny, you got 'em.
DANNY=>Oh, geeze... Yeah. I just took Mel out.
BOB=>Thanks Pal. How's your math coming?
DANNY=>Great, got a "C" on my last test.
BOB=>Alright! I'll give you a raise if you can get it to a "B".
DANNY=>"C" plus?
BOB=>Deal.
BOB=>Hey, Mel, any calls?
BOB=>Ya hungry?
BOB=>Sorry. Here y'go...
DELIVERY GIRL=>Thanks, Mr. Rueland. See ya tomorrow night. Bye, bye, Mel.
BOB=>C'mon Mel.
BOB=>God damn it.
BOB=>C'mon Mel, stop it. She's gone. You can't sit here night after night. C'mon get up... Do you think that's what she would have wanted? C'mon, get up Mel... Look at you... Look at you...
BOB=>Charlie. I'll go on Friday night. Yeah, you heard me. Where is it?
BOB=>O'Rielly's "Italian" Restaurant? Uh-huh. Yeah, me too.
ANGELO=>It's a busy, no? I love Fridays.
MARTY=>Here's some leftovers for y'lassy...
GRACE=>No way...Grandpa! Rome!
MARTY=>Ah, save that for the Italians... I know you love me.
GRACE=>Oh my, Grandpa, you do too much...
MARTY=>Angelo says a true artist must pain in the Pizza Navona...
ANGELO=>"Piazza" Navona...Marone.
GRACE=>Grandpa, you have to come with me...
MARTY=>You go for both of us. Instead of postcards, you send me paintings.
SOPHIE=>You couldn't wait till I was in the kitchen?
MARTY=>Her face still has the same expression as when she opened it... See?
SOPHIE=>I miss everything...
GRACE=>Grandpa, I'm so happy to be right here. I never imagined... I think I'll go in the fall...
MARTY=>Okay, Sophie, back to work.
SOPHIE=>Can I see it?
GRACE=>Angelo, thank you. Wait till I tell Megan...
ANGELO=>One more surprise, "he" is here.
GRACE=>Who-He?
ANGELO=>The guy I tell you about. He's at the bar waiting to meet you.
GRACE=>Angelo...
ANGELO=>It's okay, I tell him you had you chest worked on...
GRACE=>Angelo, please...my "chest worked on?" He's going to expect...
ANGELO=>What?
GRACE=>Whatever... You don't have to--
ANGELO=>This guy is different. He's just like you. He have a transplant.
MAN=>So, I'm still in a little pain, but you know how that is...
MAN=>My doctors say it's a solid transplant. Go ahead, pull it.
GRACE=>No, that's okay.
MAN=>C'mon, giver 'er a tug.
VALET GUY=>You staying or leaving or what?
BOB=>Huh? Um, staying...
MARTY=>Grace, we have a new four top.
GRACE=>I'm right on it. Nice meeting you.
MAN=>Likewise, I'm sure.
MARSHA=>I said it's Squeaker, my kitty. Well, as you can imagine, everyone laughed... That's when I met Charlie, he was the only Vet open... Are they bringing menus? Anyway, Squeaker won't let another Vet touch him.
CHARLIE=>Yeah, well I don't want to hear about anyone else touching your Squeaker.
BOB=>Nice place, Chuck.
MARSHA=>It's okay... Small.
CHARLIE=>It's family run. Great food.
MARSHA=>I went to a little place in Spain once that looked just like this except it was a glove store.
BOB=>Is that right?
MARSHA=>Hm-mmm. So Rob, Charlie tells me you're an engineer.
CHARLIE=>He's a structural engineer. You know that new building on State Street, that's Bob's.
SHARI=>You own it?
BOB=>No, I designed it.
SHARI=>Oh.
MARSHA=>No, no, no... Do you have bottled water?
GRACE=>Yes, of course. Anyone else?
BOB=>Excuse me, do I know you?
GRACE=>I think so... You've been here before.
BOB=>No. I'd remember an Irish Italian restaurant.
MARSHA=>Whatever... Water, I just don't want Swiss. I got sick on imported Swiss water once. As long as it's not Swiss or tap water, it'll be fine. Preferably, French. I'd like it cold, no ice, no glass, just the bottle and a straw. You want to write it down?
GRACE=>I'm pretty sure I have it. Anyone else?
BOB=>No, thank you.
CHARLIE=>A wine list please.
GRACE=>Sure.
BOB=>Excuse me, could I have a coffee? No straw.
GRACE=>Sure.
BOB=>What? Oh, I usually don't bring it... Excuse me. Rueland... Hey Mike... Uh-huh
BOB=>I'm glad... So let's call in a favor on Hank...the brick layer. We'll contract them for five days, they'll do four for me, then one day at the zoo. Either way, they get paid for five like under the original contract... Who else is on the clock?
MARSHA=>Such a difference...
GRACE=>We have some wonderful specials this evening; a lovely Chicken Vesuvio...
CHARLIE=>Please, I'm around them all day.
GRACE=>A corn beef and cabbage souffle and a spinach ravioli in an arrabiatta sauce, it's my favorite.
BOB=>I'll have that...
GRACE=>Okay, and a sword fish, served with white wine sauce and tomato and garlic checca...
MARSHA=>I'll have veal.
GRACE=>We don't serve veal.
MARSHA=>Oh, brother...
BOB=>Just get something else...
SHARI=>Charlie, you order for me.
CHARLIE=>We'll need another minute.
BOB=>Thank you.
GRACE=>Sure, take your time...
MARTY=>Grazi. Grazi. Angelo! We need...
MARTY=>Three more Shepard pies!
MARSHA=>An Italian restaurant that doesn't serve veal...
BOB=>Rueland... Yeah, Mike? Uh-huh... Well, I'll leave right now. Be there in five minutes... No, it's not a problem, if I have to be there, I have to be there.
CHARLIE=>Where?
BOB=>The Wabash building.
CHARLIE=>Tonight: They're working on a Friday night?
BOB=>Oh yeah... I'm so sorry Marsha, really very sorry. It was nice meeting you, and Shari... Please, enjoy your meal and...again, I apologize. If you'll excuse me.
GRACE=>Everything okay?
BOB=>Oh, hi, yes, fine. I just got called to work...
GRACE=>What about your wife?...and her friends, will they be staying--
BOB=>She's not my wife...not a friend, not an acquaintance, and yes, they'll be staying...
GRACE=>Oh...
GRACE=>Soph? What is that?
SOPHIE=>Ravioli... Chicken Vesuvio and a side of cabbage...for pick up.
GRACE=>Here it is... Mr. Ahtsuki. Sorry for the wait... Since it took so long, it's on the house. Come back again...
CHARLIE=>Bob, what's the deal?
BOB=>I came out didn't I?
CHARLIE=>Yeah, congratulations... You lasted almost a half an hour... That's a record... I only met her a couple of times, I had no idea she was so..."not you"...
BOB=>It's fine, Chuck. It's not her, it's me... She's everything you said she was, an attorney with a great body.
CHARLIE=>C'mon, you're already out, it's Friday night, have some wine... Okay, have a lot of wine and enjoy the company...
BOB=>I can't. If I could I would... But I've gotta go to work.
CHARLIE=>I know you're going home...
MR. AHTSUKI=>I no need to park. I just pick up order. One minute. Give me my keys, I be one minute...
JEFF=>Bob, I know on this most recent set... We're only enclosing the one Oak tree?
BOB=>I have a different set of prints in the office.
JEFF=>That's what I thought Mike said.
BOB=>We'll keep working Saturdays and we'll work late...
BOB=>Mike, give the newest plans to Jeff, so we can run over 'em right away.
JEFF=>Is this going to be the last set?
MIKE=>Yes.
BOB=>Anyone call about my phone?
MIKE=>Yep, restaurant called back, they have it...
BOB=>Who called...from the restaurant?
MIKE=>I don't know...some woman. I'll send one of the interns to pick it up.
BOB=>No. I can swing by there later...
JEFF=>Are there going to be any trees in the souvenir shop?
TOMMY=>And here's the baby pigs and see, the mommy had ten baby bottles coming out of her tummy.
JOE=>Stop with the piano! Megan...
MEGAN=>I'm not playing it.
TOMMY=>And then we went to see the gorillas and Mommy said it was you.
MEGAN=>I did not.
JOE=>Oh, really? Did you go to see the elephants?
MEGAN=>Watch it, Joe.
GRACE=>I'll change her.
JOE=>It's okay, Grace. I got it.
MEGAN=>Father Rudy?
JOE=>Stop it, Meg. He's not a priest anymore.
MEGAN=>To me, he is. She'll meet someone on her own, Joe.
JOE=>How? She's always here on her nights off. He has about as much experience as she does. Where you gonna find a guy like that?
MEGAN=>Who would want to?
JOE=>He's a nice guy.
MEGAN=>It's hard to dance, when there's nobody leading.
GRACE=>Is everything okay?
JOE=>Fine.
MEGAN=>No. Joe went'n invited someone over here, sort of as a blind date.
GRACE=>When? Tonight?
JOE=>It's not a "date". He's just coming over for dinner.
GRACE=>I need a scarf or some make-up.
JOE=>Don't worry. I told him you had some work done.
GRACE=>What?
MEGAN=>She's not a Buick, Joe.
JOE=>It's okay. He understands. He's fine with it. He's a priest for Godsake.
GRACE=>A priest?!
JOE=>An EX-priest. Jesus Christ, what's the big deal? He's never dated, you've never dated.
MEGAN=>Joe, Grace has dated.
GRACE=>It's okay Meg.
MEGAN=>No it's not.
TOMMY=>Do you hate priests, Aunt Grace?
GRACE=>No, honey.
TOMMY=>Cuz if you do you'll go straight to hell.
JOE=>No one is going to hell. God y'try and help someone...
MEGAN=>Go ahead, Grace, leave. Get out the back door.
GRACE=>My bike's in the front.
TOMMY=>Oh, shit, Father Rudy's here.
MEGAN=>Tommy don't you dare talk like that.
TOMMY=>Don't worry Mom, Dad said no one's going to hell.
JOE=>FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, EVERYONE CALM DOWN!
RUDY=>I'm not used to being without it yet.
CHARLIE=>Bobby, my man. Where the hell are you? You run away last night and tonight you don't show. I've been sitting at the bar for two hours... No, I'm all alone...
BOB=>I'm not up to it... Yeah, "again"... I'm uh...watching the game...the score? Uh... Cubs are losing.
DANNY=>Hey, Mr. Rueland, Mel ate something. I couldn't get to him, I think it was a rib bone...
BOB=>Is that right Mel?
DANNY=>And he rolled in something...a dead something... I can give him a bath...
BOB=>How much?
DANNY=>Ten bucks.
BOB=>Ten?
DANNY=>I use soap now. My mom made you another lemon cake. I put it in the trash for ya.
BOB=>Thanks, pal. I'd give you twenty to see you eat that.
DANNY=>There's easier ways to make money.
BOB=>How do I look?
DANNY=>Tall.
BOB=>Tall?
DANNY=>Yep.
BOB=>Thanks...
GRACE=>Megan... It was fine. He was a nice guy. Certainly knows his wine... But did you notice...
JOE=>Tell her I'm "sorry" about tonight.
PATRICK=>Whaaaaa! Mom!
JOE=>God damn it!
TOMMY=>God damn it!
JOEY=>Daddy, can I have some water?
JOE=>No. Everyone's going to bed. Forever! Megan!
MEGAN=>I have to go... And Grace, you're not lucky. It's fate.
MARTY=>Sweet dreams, my dear Lass.
GRACE=>You want some help?
MARTY=>No, I'm blessed with work.
ANGELO=>Best female singer?
WALLY=>Ella Fitzgerald.
MARTY=>Agree.
EMMETT=>Agree.
ANGELO=>Of course.
EMMETT=>Okay. But Wally, I'd still take Ernie Banks over Ty Cobb.
WALLY=>Doesn't work. You can't pick your dream team from different eras.
EMMETT=>Is this a new rule?
MARTY=>Either you're late or really early...
BOB=>Sorry to bother you but I left my phone here...
MARTY=>No, no, no bother. Please come in. It's starting to come down out there. I'll check for you, a phone, huh?
BOB=>That's right...
MARTY=>So many are left. Every week, one or two phones... I think it's no good, too many phones in our lives. Y'got no one really talkin' anymore, face to face. I don't see one in here...
BOB=>I believe a young lady called, said she found it...
MARTY=>I'll getcha a beer and I'll take a look around in back...
BOB=>Oh, no thanks...
MARTY=>Ah, y'gotta get home to y'er wife...
BOB=>No.
MARTY=>She walked out on ya, did she?
BOB=>No... She passed away...
MARTY=>Aw, I ought to be on my knees thanking God I'm on my feet... Let me getcha a pint.
BOB=>No, it's fine...
MARTY=>Boys, this is my friend...
BOB=>Bob.
MARTY=>Robert! His wife is dead.
EMMETT=>Settle something for us here, pal. Who is the greatest center fielder of all time?
BOB=>Ken Griffey Jr.
SOPHIE=>I'm on my way home, who's walking me?
WALLY=>You're two doors down, if y'get killed we'll hear it...
SOPHIE=>I hope I get killed so you have to live with the guilt.
WALLY=>Yap, yap, yap...
MARTY=>I'll take ya. Be back...
WALLY=>Doesn't matter, Ella Fitzgerald was the greatest singer of all time.
ANGELO=>We all agree on that Wally. Why do you keep bringing it up? I'm in...
WALLY=>Because I'd like to hear more of her in here. You're always playing that opera stuff, we can't sing along.
EMMETT=>Go and find yourself a Shakey's pizza for that. You folding, Wal?
WALLY=>Remember Shakey's Pizza?
BOB=>Oh, yeah sure... I'm in...I guess...
EMMETT=>Ground Round was good... In...
BOB=>Throw the peanuts on the floor...
WALLY=>Yeah... At Shakey's they'd put the words up on the screen... My kids loved that. Everyone singing. I - am - in.
BOB=>Unbelievable...
MARTY=>It's your lucky night...
GRACE=>Grandpa, the rain's let up a bit, so I'll be out back covering...
GRACE=>Hello...
MARTY=>Robert, this is my granddaughter. Grace.
BOB=>Hi, yes... We met last evening. I was here with...the water thing...
GRACE=>Nice to see you again. Robert.
BOB=>Bob. Bob's fine.
BOB=>I left my phone here...
GRACE=>Oh, "that" Bob. You're Bob. I'm Grace, well, you know that... We just said it... Well, excuse me... I'm not dressed and my hair is...well, hiding... I have your pajamas...phone...behind the bar...
MARTY=>I'll get it Grace, you sit.
ANGELO=>Your bike? I'll do it.
GRACE=>No Angelo, my new plants.
BOB=>...If I can be of any help?
GRACE=>No...thanks...
ANGELO=>Yes. You can help her, Roberto will help you.
GRACE=>Sorry about my grandfather. Some people take in stray dogs and cats, with Grandpa, it's people... Not that you're...
BOB=>Oh, yes I am... Should we do this one here?
GRACE=>It's okay, I can do it. There's just these two left.
GRACE=>Excuse me...
BOB=>Sure, I'll just go around. You smell great.
GRACE=>They get yellow if they get too much moisture this early on... I put them in the ground too soon... And of course I just watered them this morning... You can go if you want. I can do this.
BOB=>No, no, I don't mind... You bought me dinner last night. Who's the artist.
GRACE=>Oh, that... I painted that.
BOB=>Wow... Can't even see the numbers through the paint.
ALL=>What? I look ridiculous.
BOB=>No. It's a lovely...hat.
GRACE=>I'd take it off now, but then I'd have "shower cap head"... Of course you saw my hair last night... Not that you were looking at me. But we did speak, so maybe you noticed my head--hair... my hair--my head of hair... Okay...
BOB=>Can I take you out sometime?
GRACE=>Yes?
BOB=>Is that a question?
GRACE?=>No. It's a yes-yes.
BOB=>Tomorrow night?
GRACE=>Yes.
BOB=>I'll pick you up at eight?
GRACE=>Yes.
BOB=>Sure?
GRACE=>Yes.
BOB=>You're a very difficult woman.
BOB=>You go ahead in, I'll get these last two...
GRACE=>I'll find your phone.
ANGELO=>Hurry up, get in the kitchen!
WALLY=>What?
MARTY=>They're coming back in.
WALLY=>But I have my best hand.
EMMETT=>New shuffle if we re-locate.
ANGELO=>Fair enough.
BOB=>Thanks...
GRACE=>Sure...
BOB=>Eight then...
GRACE=>Eight...
GRACE=>Grandpa? Angelo?
MARTY=>We're not here.
MEGAN=>Who is it?
GRACE=>Me.
GRACE=>I met someone.
BOB=>I guess this is the first woman I've noticed since... Well, not the first woman I've "noticed", you know as a guy, but as a man. You know what I mean...
BOB=>I'm building you a great place.
MEGAN=>I'm just saying for safety--don't shave your legs, because then you won't--definitely won't let it go to far.
GRACE=>Megan, it's a first date.
MEGAN=>I married a first date.
GRACE=>You should needlepoint that on a pillow.
MEGAN=>All I know is, it kept me a virgin till I was eighteen.
GRACE=>Megan, I'm going to be thirty, I have a ten inch scar down my chest, and I'm a virgin...
MEGAN=>Shave your legs. Call me after.
BOB=>My Uncle Al always had a cigar going... And in his other hand he carried a bean bag ash tray, red plaid...he'd love to drive down alleys and pick up other people's junk. I was his spotter. My mother would get so mad. But without fail, come her birthday, Uncle Al would make some great lamp or table out of the lumber and stuff we collected. She loved everything he ever made... But every time he collected stuff, they'd have the same argument... "Don't bring that junk in my house!" "It's not junk!" Well, anyway, I've loved building things ever since...
GRACE=>So you and Katherine never had children?
BOB=>No... Thought we had time. Sometimes it seems like yesterday and others when it seems like another life...
GRACE=>...I know what you mean...
BOB=>I've done all the talking haven't I?
GRACE=>You okay?
BOB=>Fine...just fine.
GRACE=>Oh, my God--I'm so sorry.
BOB=>Geeze, I was just going to kiss you.
GRACE=>I know--I'm sorry. I mean--it's not you...
BOB=>I was just going to kiss you. A small peck on the cheek.
GRACE=>...it's...I had this dream about you--and...
BOB=>It must have been a nightmare.
GRACE=>No, you were very sexy...
BOB=>You had a sex dream about me?
GRACE=>No, of course not. Well, it might have been. I don't know--I stopped it...
BOB=>...uh-huh.
GRACE=>I didn't want to--I mean--I just met you--I don't really even know you...
BOB=>Sometimes those dreams are better with strangers. Ah...
GRACE=>Are you okay?
BOB=>Fine, fine... Must have been some dream...
GRACE=>You ripped my blouse...
BOB=>I'm sorry.
GRACE=>It's okay...
BOB=>Nice blouse, was it?
GRACE=>Well, it was... This one.
BOB=>Very nice...
GRACE=>Thank you.
BOB=>I didn't mean to...be so forward... Not in the dream--but here just now...
GRACE=>No, please, it's me... I'm...
GRACE=>Good night.
BOB=>'Night...
BOB=>Morning, Jeff. Morning there, Big Mike.
JEFF=>Mornin'...
MIKE=>Whatever.
WALLY=>It's the new hip.
JOE=>Wally, which one is yours?
WALLY=>Shut your trap...
SOPHIE=>I didn't say anything.
WALLY=>I'm talking to Joe...mark my strike.
SOPHIE=>I did, I'm using stars instead of x's now...
WALLY=>Ah, Crimeny!
ANGELO=>Doesn't matter how she marks it. I'm still beating ya.
EMMETT=>Ten spot on the next shot says it's a strike... After Joe...
BOB=>I'm in...
MARTY=>C'mon Joe, send 'em running...
WALLY=>Grandma's teeth. Nice.
JOE=>It's these damn shoes...
ANGELO=>Maybe you could knock 'em down with a fire hose?
MARTY=>Gracie, Honey, you're up next on the right.
GRACE=>How do I look?
MEGAN=>The best ever. I've never seen you so happy.
GRACE=>God I'm hot...
MEGAN=>It's eighty degrees out and you're wearing a turtle neck...
GRACE=>It's cotton...
MEGAN=>Too bad you didn't meet him in the fall, you would have been safe for months... Tell him.
GRACE=>I will.
MEGAN=>He's a great guy, it won't make a difference to him, besides, eventually he's gonna want to get, you know, intimate.
GRACE=>Megan please.
MEGAN=>Just tell him...or he'll think you're a lesbian or something.
GRACE=>What?
MEGAN=>It's very trendy right now.
EMMETT=>You two's, do your yapping at the beauty parlor!
MEGAN=>Take it easy, Dad.
BOB=>I got you a hot chocolate.
GRACE=>Oh?
BOB=>I thought maybe you were cold.
GRACE=>Thank you.
MARTY=>C'mon now, let's bowl.
BOB=>I'll just hold on to this for ya...
GRACE=>Alrighty, who's up next?
MARTY=>Bob, you're up!
ANGELO=>You're taking turns away? I'm next.
SOPHIE=>Angelo's up.
CHARLIE=>Bob?
BOB=>Hey, hey, you made it...
CHARLIE=>I thought I was meeting you at a bar?
BOB=>There's a bar here. Grace!
CHARLIE=>What is this?
BOB=>We're bowling. What?
GRACE=>Hey Charlie, we're already in the ninth frame, or you could join the game.
CHARLIE=>Oh shoot. That's OK, maybe next time.
GRACE=>Everyone, this is Charlie.
CHARLIE=>Hi...everyone...
EMMETT=>You want in?
BOB=>Sure he does... Tenspot.
EMMETT=>For or against?
CHARLIE=>Huh? For... I guess...
MARTY=>C'mon Bob...tenth frame and you're looking at beating your all time highest score...
CHARLIE=>I didn't know he bowled...
MARTY=>...of sixty-seven.
JOE=>He doesn't.
WALLY=>You're sittin' on a sixty-six... You wanna use my ball, go ahead...
BOB=>That's okay, Wally. I"m not really dressed...
BOB=>I'd like to dedicate this next shot to Grace... who brought me back to the game after a twenty-five year absence. That's right, before I was your beer runner and... milk man... I hadn't bowled since Andee Jankovsky's thirteenth birthday party... So baby, this one's for you.
EMMETT=>You get a strike here, we go fifty-fifty...
JOE=>Try your other arm!
WALLY=>C'mon Bobby, shake 'em up...
EMMETT=>I've always found that Sammy Davis was the most talented and I've always liked Bill Cosby...
CHARLIE=>Oh, yeah, they're both great.
GRACE=>This will be good for about a week. I put some bread in there, too...
CHARLIE=>Thank you... Bob, I had a great time. See you Guys...
GRACE=>He's very sweet.
BOB=>Charlie? Oh, yeah...
EMMETT=>Hey, there, Bob-o, you in tonight?
BOB=>No, Emmett, Grace and I are gonna enjoy a glass of wine out back...maybe take a walk...
WALLY=>You two want my cadillac tonight?
GRACE=>On, no... That's okay...
WALLY=>Just had her waxed...
BOB=>Thanks Wally... You need a sweater?
GRACE=>Nope...
MARTY=>I've got a new candle out there, keeps the bugs away...
ANGELO=>Marty!
MARTY=>What? I think she'll tell him...
EMMETT=>I don't see what the big deal is. I once dated a girl with a club foot. She had the big shoe and everything...
MARTY=>You're a saint...
SOPHIE=>The longer she waits the harder it will be...
ANGELO=>Let's put on some music for 'em...
MARTY=>Let's see... Dean...
ANGELO=>Pavarotti.
EMMETT=>Bing...
WALLY=>Let me handle this.
MARTY=>No "Bobby"...
WALLY=>We should put on something modern... Where's your new albums?
EMMETT=>CD's.
WALLY=>Yeah, yeah...
MARTY=>Here's my hippest stuff...
WALL=>Oh, this is my favorite...
SMOKEY=>I'm gonna do all the things to you, a girl wants a man to do.. Oh, baby..
GRACE=>Oh, dear...
MARTY=>What's happening?
WALLY=>Let it work its magic...
GRACE=>I'll tell them to turn it off...
BOB=>No, no, no. C'mon...
SMOKEY=>'Cuz every minute, every hour, I"m gonna shower you with love and affection, look out girl, it's coming in your direction...
WALLY=>It's working...
SMOKEY=>'Cuz I'm gonna make you love me, ooh yes I will, yes I will...
DIANA ROSS=>Our love is strong, you'll see I know, you'll never get tired of me... Oh baby...
DIANA ROSS=>I'm gonna use every trick in the book, I'll try my best to get you hooked... oh baby... 'Cuz every night, every day, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna get ya, I'm gonna get, look out boy, 'cuz I'm gonna get you...
GRACE=>I'm telling him tonight.
MEGAN=>I've heard that before... He's perfect, you know.
GRACE=>Yeah. For me he is.
MEGAN=>Don't get me wrong. He's no Joe.
JOE=>Honey, Bridgette got sick on me. I gave her some Tylenol and put her in pajamas. She's sleeping in our bed. Hey, Al.
GRACE=>Hey, Joe...
JOE=>What?
MEGAN=>Put a shirt on, Joe... or Grace will never be satisfied by another man.
BOB=>Billy, could you put that dry wall over against the wired frame? Thanks.
CHARLIE=>My pride and joy. King of Beasts.
BOB=>He looks just like you.
CHARLIE=>Bennington called, he wants to do your introduction. Katherine would love that, huh?
BOB=>She'd love this...
CHARLIE=>You did it...
BOB=>Took me long enough.
CHARLIE=>So, go for a beer? Or is tonight Bingo?
BOB=>Charlie, I'm sorry. I can't, the dedication's next week...
CHARLIE=>Take a break, you've been working like a dog...
BOB=>Grace wants to talk, she's making dinner at my place.
CHARLIE=>She wants to "talk", she's making you "dinner", she won't "spend the night"... You see what's going on here, don't ya?
BOB=>No.
CHARLIE=>It's a trap. She's read that book, what's it called... "The Rules".
BOB=>What are you talking about?
CHARLIE=>It's a little game they play to reel a guy in...
BOB=>Well, it's working.
BOB=>Hey, look everybody! Baby lion!
GRACE=>You sure you don't need any help?
BOB=>No. Believe it or not, I can microwave popcorn. There was a write up about the habitat's dedication in the Trib...
GRACE=>Everyone's going next week, Grandpa wants to be there, and Emmett, Wally, the whole gang...
BOB=>As long as you promise to be there...
GRACE=>Promise...
BOB=>Sydney's thrilled. We let him in for a bit this afternoon...he loves it...he can run... Finally...
GRACE=>You've worked so hard...
BOB=>It was worth it... Katherine's dream coming true... At least I was able to give her that... In a way I'm dreading the dedication because I can't imagine it without her... I've been angry for so long...
BOB=>Thank you, Grace...
BOB=>You're not going to slap me?
GRACE=>Only if you stop...
BOB=>You wanted to tell me something...
GRACE=>Yes...
GRACE=>...Now's a good time...
GRACE=>Oh dear...Bob...
GRACE=>Popcorn's done...
BOB=>Save my place...
BOB=>You can put on some music...
GRACE=>Sure-yes-good...
BOB=>I got you a CD. It's in the pocket of my jacket, which is hanging on the door in the den.
GRACE=>Dean Martin. Thank you.
BOB=>What?
GRACE=>I said, thanks for the...
BOB=>Grace?
GRACE=>I'm sorry...
BOB=>What?
GRACE=>I have to go...
BOB=>Now?
GRACE=>Yes... I completely forgot. I... I promised Megan I'd... baby sit.
BOB=>I'll go with you...
GRACE=>No, no...
BOB=>Are you okay?
GRACE=>Yes... You stay here. I'll call you...
GRACE=>This damn bike.
BOB=>Grace, slow down. I'll call her and say you're on your way...
GRACE=>No...the baby might be napping. I have to go. I'm late...
BOB=>Okay, okay... What did you want to tell me?
GRACE=>I love you.
BOB=>Mel. Stay.
MEGAN=>I'm answering it this time.
GRACE=>No, let the machine get it.
MEGAN=>I'd be home by now... Hello... Hi Bib...
GRACE=>Ohmigod, ohmigod... What was God thinking?
MEGAN=>I'll take you back over, let's go...
GRACE=>Wait...no... What do I say?
MEGAN=>You just tell him...
GRACE=>I know...but what do I say?
MEGAN=>The truth...
GRACE=>How?
MEGAN=>Just tell him... Say, Bob...
GRACE=>You can't even say it.
JOE=>Who died?
MEGAN=>No one...
GRACE=>Bob's wife...
JOE=>He's married? That Bastard...
TOMMY=>Bastard.
MEGAN=>Joe, shh...
JOE=>You want me to go over there and handle this?
GRACE=>No...no...
JOE=>I knew it...he was way too nice...
MEGAN=>Joe! Out! Take the boys upstairs...
JOE=>What is going on? Don't push... Grace, tell me what's going on...
MEGAN=>Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart... now go...
JOE=>Why didn't you just tell me that? Geeze...
MARTY=>Grace, it is a character of strength that God gives the most challenges... Consider it a compliment.
BOB=>Excuse me, I was wondering if a beautiful artist lived here?
MARTY=>Robert. I was just telling Grace you called and said you'd be stopping by.
GRACE=>A bike... You bought me a bike...
BOB=>You haven't even opened it yet.
GRACE=>With a basket...
BOB=>I think she likes it. Grace...is everything okay?
GRACE=>No...I waited too long...to tell you something...
BOB=>You're trembling...
GRACE=>A little over a year ago, I had a heart transplant...
BOB=>Oh my God... I thought you were going to tell me you were married or something... Are you okay? Am I hurting you.. Are you alright now?
GRACE=>No...yes...
GRACE=>This is me...
MARTY=>You're sure you can check this?
GRACE=>Yes, I want to take it.
ANGELO=>Fabrizio will pick you up at the airport in Rome.
MARTY=>He should know you're leaving...
MEGAN=>Grace, don't leave...
GRACE=>He wants time to think...
MARTY=>You pray in Rome. God'll hear you better...
MIKE=>Electrical inspector, on the seventeenth floor. He approves it, and we can go ahead and lay the cable...
BOB=>Yeah, yeah, I'll go right up...
JEFF=>Phillip and Reagan about Wabash... That's it...
BOB=>Sophie? Hi, is Grace there?... You're sure? Marty there? Uh-huh...uh-huh... I don't have Meg's number on me... Thanks...
JEFF=>Bob, I'll ride with you to the zoo... The suits are meeting us at noon...
BOB=>Damn it! Mike, do me a favor... Keep trying this.
MIKE=>And...
BOB=>Tell them to hold and come get me. C'mon, Jeff, let's take a look at seventeen.
BOB=>Was Grace with her?
BABY-SITTER=>I don't know... She left really early...before Regis and Kathie Lee...
BOB=>Here's my cell number. Do you have a piece of paper?
BABY-SITTER=>Go ahead.
BOB=>O-kay...461-0192... Ask Megan to call me...
BABY-SITTER=>Yep...
MIKE=>Where is he? I thought he was coming over with you...
JEFF=>He left before I did...
MIKE=>Where were you?
BOB=>I'm here.
BOB=>Jeff, any calls?
JEFF=>Yeah...Charlie. He's moving Sydney in... ...about now...wants him comfortable by the dedication... P.R. thing...
BOB=>Fine. Talk to me about the pipes?
MIKE=>They're in, waterfall will be on time...
BOB=>You guys go ahead... Marty!
MARTY=>I'd live here...
BOB=>Yeah, it's nice, isn't it? You alone?
MARTY=>Yes... Gotta minute?
BOB=>Yeah sure...
MARTY=>Now Robert, this is none of my business. I know what has happened is overwhelming and you need time to sort it all out... But in your sorting, just know, that when I prayed and prayed for Grace to get another chance at life... I knew that if God blessed us, the heart would have to be from someone very special, if it's to be at home in Grace...when she met you...her heart beat truly, for the first time...
BOB=>Marty!
CHARLIE=>You can go in there...
NUN=>Bicicletta...
GRACE=>Oh...my bike...
NUN=>Que belisima...
GRACE=>Oh thank you...grazi.
GRACE=>Would you like to ride it?
NUN=>Oh...no-no-no...
GRACE=>Please...
NUN=>No-no-no... Una momento...
NUN=>Tu Amour?
GRACE=>Si...
GRACE=>You came all the way to Italy...
BOB=>Yeah... I did. I came all the way to Italy... I love you, Grace.
MR. BENNINGTON=>...but my money is not what we are here to talk about...
BOB=>Thank you, Mr. Bennington, for the introduction and your contribution...
BOB=>So it is with great honor that I dedicate this habitat in loving memory of Dr. Katherine Rueland...
