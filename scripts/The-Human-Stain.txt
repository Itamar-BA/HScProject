NATHAN'S VOICE OVER=>1998 was the summer of sanctimony. America was on a piety binge. Propriety was king. After the fall of Communism and before the horrors of terrorism, there was a brief interlude when the nation was preoccupied by cocksucking.
NATHAN'S VOICE OVER=>And now they had him. After thirty years of academic distinction, Coleman Silk would be brought down by the use of one single word.
