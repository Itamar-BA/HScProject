DOMINO=>When I was a little girl... my mum took me to Euro Disney on opening day. I was told that it was the happiest place on earth.
DOMINO=>A week later... we moved to Los Angeles. I was told that this was the saddest place on Earth. The Department of Motor Vehicles in Los Angeles.
DOMINO=>They wait for their number to be called. They wait for this license to drive to yet another miserable job... dive pub... drive by shooting. That is if they're lucky enough to own an automobile. Most of them aren't. They need a license to prove their citizenship or else they'll be deported.
DOMINO=>Except for this bloke. His name is Frances. Mr. 90210 college boy had found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.
FRANCES=>I said... they're about to call my number. Are you in... or are you out?

FRANCES=>You have to decide right now. They're gonna call my number any second.
FRANCES=>Alright. We're on.
