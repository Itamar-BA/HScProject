MOTHER=>SUPERIOR. She bows.
DON JAIME=>threw there.
RAMONA=>fully opens the cupboard door and takes one of the bottles. She turns to DON JAIME.
RAMONA=>lets go of the train and goes off the frame.
DON JAIME=>You must think I'm mad.
RITA=>A black bull came.
RAMONA=>What are you doing?
JAIME=>comes to the bed and leans over her. He stares at her.
PEASANT.=>The group comes up to VIRIDIANA, to whom the man holds out his hand.
MOTHER=>SUPERIOR of VIRIDIANA's convent.
VIRIDIANA=>fearlessly stands between them.
LUCIA=>looks at him in surprise.
ZEQUIEL,=>HOBBLY, ENEDINA, and REFUGIO are there; also three other wretches, a man and two women. One of the women is a DWARF, the other, whom we will call the GARDENER, is a nondescript, middle-aged woman. The last character, who is named PACO, is a man of about fifty with a shaggy beard but no scar or physical deformity. They are all eating heartily.
VOICES=>Good evening, miss.
REFUGIO=>What does that mean?
VIRIDIANA=>What about you, Manuel?
GARDENER=>Look! It's disgusting.
VIRIDIANA=>and wishes her good night. The LEPER sits down again in his place.
VIRIDIANA=>goes out.
DON=>AMALIO's clothes.
VIRIDIANA=>comes up, followed by POCA. She is holding a white box which she had near her when she was posing for HOBBLY's picture a short time before. JORGE goes forward to meet her.
VIRIDIANA=>Are your parents alive?
VIRIDIANA=>goes up to them. We can see RAMONA'S back behind them. She is fidgeting with a bunch of keys. She seems to be waiting for something.
DON ZEQUIEL=>If it's only to have a look ...
SINGER=>opens it. They stand, gaping.
HOBBLY,=>without leaving his place, pokes him viciously with his stick.
ENEDINA=>stands in front of them. She turns her back to the camera. In a flash the still scene suddenly conjures up the scene of another Supper.
ZEQUIEL=>wipes his face with his hands, trying to get the stuff off his beard. Meanwhile, POCA, who has just seen what is happening behind the couch, passes near DON ZEQUIEL and laughs at the state he is in.
LEPER=>finishes tying up JORGE. His livid face looks ghostly in the half light. He laughs, jerking his head back as if he is having a fit of St. Vitus' dance. His work finished, he gets up and with the look of an impartial spectator watches the struggle between his benefactress and the beggar.
VIRIDIANA=>reacts quickly and flees toward the door. But the LEPER is waiting for her there and blocks her passage with folded arms. HOBBLY catches his prey again and, holding her tightly in his arms, takes her once again to the bed.
