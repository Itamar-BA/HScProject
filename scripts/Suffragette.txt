WOMEN=>VOTES FOR WOMEN!
VIOLET=>VOTES FOR WOMEN!
MAUD=>Oh, come here. Be good.
VIOLET=>Sorry Mr Taylor.
VIOLET=>This is my eldest, Maggie.
GEORGE=>Good night, Sir.
MAUD=>Thank you, sir.
EDITH=>One must look to the next generation.
OFFICER=>Two pounds, each.
MRS PANKHURST=>For fifty years we have laboured peacefully to secure the vote for women. We have been ridiculed, battered and ignored. Now we have realized that deeds and sacrifice must be the order of the day.
MRS PANKHURST=>Be militant. Each of you in your own way. Those of you who can break windows, break them. Those of you who can further attack the sacred idol of property, do so. We have been left with no alternative but to defy this government.
MRS PANKHURST=>If we must go to prison to obtain the vote, let it be the windows of government not the bodies of women that shall be broken.
MRS PANKHURST=>I would rather be a rebel than a slave!
SONNY=>Come on, George.
EDITH=>Good, then we can begin.
MAUD=>George belongs with me.
STEED=>Is your wife in?
VIOLET=>Edith, come here.
MAUD=>At least let me do that.
MAUD=>Sonny... Sonny.
EDITH=>No. I can do it.
POLICE OFFICER=>Come with us please. Youâ€™re under arrest.
ALICE=>Come in Maggie.
