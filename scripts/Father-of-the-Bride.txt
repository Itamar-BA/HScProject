GEORGE=>Well, I had to admit it. The wedding appeared to be a complete success. Now all I needed to make me happy was a dance with the bride.
HOWARD=>It's time.
BAND- LEADER=>Ladies and gentlemen. In a just a few moments, Mrs. Annie Banks- MacKenzie will be tossing her bouquet in the foyer, and then she's off to Hawaii.
GEORGE=>This I was not going to miss. The mob was headed through the living room, so I decided to take a shortcut.
ANNIE=>Where's my Dad?
BRIAN=>I don't know. I haven't seen him.
ANNIE=>Should I throw it?
NINA=>He missed it.
GEORGE=>She was gone. My Annie was gone and I was too late to say good-bye.
GEORGE=>When the last guest was gone and the last glass of champagne had been drunk, we surveyed the damage.
GEORGE=>It's funny how empty a house can suddenly get, isn't it?
NINA=>I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to say good-bye to her, George.
GEORGE=>Oh, that's all right.
NINA=>But you know, I think that she's going to be really happy.
GEORGE=>Oh yeah. Sure. : Hello?
ANNIE=>Dad?
GEORGE=>Hi! Where are you?
ANNIE=>At the airport. Our plane's about to take off, but I couldn't leave without saying good-bye. Thank Mom for everything, okay? And Dad? I love you. I love you very much.
GEORGE=>I love you, too, Sweetheart. Thanks for calling. And have a great honeymoon.
ANNIE=>Thanks. I will. Bye.
GEORGE=>That was Annie.
