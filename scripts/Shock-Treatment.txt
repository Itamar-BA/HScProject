OLIVER=>In a way...
BETTY=>I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?

OLIVER=>Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.

OLIVER=>Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front? What an ideal couple.
OLIVER=>More than anyone else in Denton they represent the old values.
OLIVER=>Eisenhower would have been proud of them.
BERT=>So would the first couple who seem to have made a hash of their marriage and cooked their goose step this way please.
JANET=>That's us.

JANET=>We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.

JANET=>I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
BERT=>We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
JANET=>He needs help.
BERT=>Face it, Janet! Brad's an emotional cripple.
JANET=>I know, I know, it's just...
BERT=>Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
BERT=>Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
JANET=>I've caught it once or twice.
BERT=>Of course! D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
JANET=>I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists! That sounds pretty drastic.
BERT=>It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
OLIVER=>McKinley?...McKinley?
BETTY=>Bert brought them over from Europe. They had a very popular series together. It's still rerun in a lot of countries. You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
OLIVER=>Never watch it.
BERT=>There's no use delaying another moment.
BERT=>I'm afraid there's only one solution. Tell them, Folks. One, two, three...
BERT=>Don't go away. We'll be right back to see if Brad and Janet want to play or pass...
BERT=>Congratulations! I think your're making a wise decision.
JANET=>But...
BRAD=>I'm not going, Janet.

VOICE OVER=>This week's special guests are Brad and Janet Majors in tonight's episode. 'The Arrival.'
MAC=>Ah. Mr. And Mrs. Majors. How wonderful to see you. I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
NATION=>We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
JANET=>Well yes, but...
BRAD=>Listen! There's nothing wrong with me... It's just that Janet and I haven't...
MAC=>Does he do that often?
JANET=>No! He's never done that before.
MAC=>Good! Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
NATION=>If anyone can help Brad. We can.
JANET=>Well, he needs help.
MAC=>Ah. Nurse Ansalong - you're here.
ANSALONG=>Well it was pretty short notice but I...
NATION=>ATTEND to Mr. Majors, Nurse.
MAC=>There are just one or two formalities that have to be dealt with, Mrs. Majors. There are contracts to be signed...
JANET=>Could I do that later?
NATION=>Of course.
ANSALONG=>Sign the contract tomorrow...
MAC=>Just one or two details. Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
JANET=>No...couldn't I do this later?
NATION=>Of course.
JANET=>Why did you tell me not to sign now?
ANSALONG=>Well this way, you get the first day free.
MOM=>About Brad's family?
DAD=>Mental instability?
MOM=>He was adopted you know.
DAD=>I'd forgotten.
MOM=>Well I hadn't. I was worried about inherited craziness when they married. I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
BERT=>Which leads us to...?
MOM=>Infantile regression?
BERT=>You got it!
MOM=>I got it! I got it!!!
BERT=>Congratulations! It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.

AND STOP YOUR CRYING=>YOU MIGHT FIND OUT I STILL LOVE YOU IN MY OWN WAY
JANET=>IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH THEN I'M SO SORRY I MET YOU IT WAS ALMOST LIKE LEADING YOU ON BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT ALL THEN JUST WRINGING YOUR HEART OUT OVER SOMEETHING THAT KEEPS ON GOING WRONG SO DON'T TELL ME YOU LOVE ME HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
JANET NO DON'T SELL EMOTION YOU CAN'T BUY DEVOTION=>WHEN YOU'RE FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS
JANET=>I HOPE THAT YOU'LL SMILE WHEN YOU REACH YOUR CONCLUSION I HOPE THAT YOU'LL KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY BUT IF IT SHOULD MEAN THAT THE PARTY IS OVER YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I STILL LVOE YOU YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I STLL LOVE YOU IN MY OWN WAY
MOM=>Oh my poor baby.
JANET=>Oh. Mom. It's Brad.
MOM=>I know.
MOM=>They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show. The Far East meets the Mid-West!
JANET=>It's...
MOM=>Just what the Doctor ordered. I know. Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
JANET=>What show?
MOM=>'Dentonvale.'
MOM=>Infantile regression.
BERT=>You got it!
MOM=>I got it! I got it!!!
NATION=>Our speciality.
BERT=>Well I confess the decision to have Brad committed was not strictly my own.
MAC=>Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled. If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
BERT=>No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
MAC=>SPONSOR!!!
BERT=>Dentonvale has been sold.
MAC=>SOLD??!!
NATION=>Dear old Bert's settled everything.
BERT=>Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
MAC=>HE!!?? How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
NATION=>I don't think he intends to go that far.
JANET=>Poor Brad.
MOM=>Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
TV=>'THANK GOODNESS'
MOM=>And thank goodness he hasn't ended up like the Slepstrini boy.
DAD=>What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block. I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week. And Hank says Danny's moved to New York. To better himself.
MOM=>He moved all right! When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
JANET=>Mexicans.
DAD=>I'm going to catch up on a few jobs that need doing outside.
MOM=>You shouldn't have said that.
JANET=>Why?
MOM=>Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
DAD=>A MAN SHOULD CALL THE TOSS...WEAR THE PANTS AND
BE THE BOSS=>A MAN SHOULD BE THE DRAKE FOR HIS OWN DAMNED SAKE... AND MEN SHOULD BE THE MISTERS AND MASTERS OF THEIR
SISTERS=>AND MEN SHOULD BE THE REASON FOR A HEART TO BREAK
DAD=>A MAN SHOULD CUT THE LAWN...CHANGE A TYRE...
MEND THE WORN=>A MAN SHOULD NEVER WAIT TO OIL A RUSTING GATE MEN SHOULD HOLD THE KEY POSITIONS IN OUR COUNTRY'S
GREAT TRADITIONS=>A MAN SHOULD PUT THE FOOD UPON THE FAMILY PLATE.
SOLDIERS SO BE MORAL DON'T QUARREL=>FAIR AND SQUARE IS BEST

FAGGOTS ARE MAGGOTS=>THANK GOD I'M A MAN
PARKER=>Hey! What are you trying to do? Get yourself committed?
JANET=>I'm sorry, Officer.
PARKER=>Vance! Vance Parker.
JANET=>Janet. Janet Majors. It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and... I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
PARKER=>Dentonvale...say, that's for... I'm sorry to hear that, Janet. (secretly pleased
JANET=>Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
PARKER=>Don't worry, Janet. Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
BETTY=>Conspiracy? That sounds a little farfetched.
OLIVER=>It's happened before. Remember Lieutenant Orpheus? He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
BETTY=>Sounds like my husband. He never came back either. At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
OLIVER=>Ah yes. Farley Flavors. You know, I find it...
OLIVER=>...remarkable that his 'Faith Factory' is being financed by an entire nation's indigestion.
RALPH=>Oh. Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
RALPH=>Yeah, well. Here, Betty. I just came to give you this.
RALPH=>I better get going. Tomorrow's the big one, and, well, Farley expects!
OLIVER=>Of course.
RALPH=>I'll leave you young things to it.
BETTY=>Shove it, Ralph!
RALPH=>You too, Betty!
BETTY=>Alimony is just another word for rape!
BETTY=>Conspiracy is right. The Denton Dossier is...
OLIVER=>...closed?
BERT=>What a meal! I insist on the recipe.
NATION=>Coming from a gourmet that's praise indeed. But. No secrets!
MAC=>With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
BERT=>Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see. Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
NATION=>Our field.
MAC=>What does he know about it?
BERT=>Who do you think gave you the next episode?
BERT=>So that Janet would be free to front line his 'Faith Factory.'
MAC=>We're the experts.
BERT=>Who trusts experts?
BERT=>I am in Farley's employ -- and... ...we're discussing a network deal.
NATION=>Why Janet?
BERT=>Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
NATION=>So it seems.
VOICE OVER=>Tonight's episode. 'Janet's Dilemma"
MAC AND NATION=>Janet!!
JANET=>I've come to see Brad.
NATION=>That's out of the question, he's sleeping like a baby.
MAC=>It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
NATION=>Yes how are you, Janet? Are you happy?
JANET=>I'm...happy.
MAC=>There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
NATION=>But they only think they're happy.
JANET=>That doesn't make sense.
BERT=>This might, Janet.
FARLEY=>A BIG DENTON WELCOME TO MY NEW DELEGATION THIS IS FARLEY -- I'M HERE WITH THE SCORE WE'RE GONNA' PACKAGE AND SELL SOME MENTAL
HEALTH TO THE NATION=>WITH MY DREAM OF THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.

NATION=>I love home movies, don't you?
TIME IS TIGHT JANET DO IT RIGHT JANET=>UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT, JANET.
JANET=>I won't be a party to this. I want to see Brad.
NATION=>The question is, does Brad want to see you? Quite frankly, he hates you.
JANET=>What do you mean?
MAC=>Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
JANET=>Me?
MAC=>It's classical. Almost a textbook case...
MAC=>That's an extremely negative response.
NATION=>Yes, Janet. Leave the crying to Brad.
JANET=>Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
BERT=>On the contrary. He wants to see your ratings soar. He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
BETTY=>I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this. We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
OLIVER=>Now Betty, don't overreact.
BETTY=>Overreact! You're the one with theories about conspirac... Oliver?
OLIVER=>Yes, Betty.
BETTY=>Are you spoken for this evening?
BERT=>Right! An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
JANET=>Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
BERT=>Home?
NATION=>This is the nerve center of operations, Janet. You must stay here tonight. That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
MAC=>And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
NATION=>Are all the beds made up?
ANSALONG=>Yep.
MAC=>Then have Ricky lock up for the night.
OLIVER=>Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
BETTY=>It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
OLIVER=>A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
BETTY=>Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor. As a matter of fact...
BETTY=>'IT IS AN ANCIENT MARINER AND HE STOPPETH ONE OF THREE BY THE LONG GREY BEARD AND GLITTEREING EYE NOW WHEREFORE STOPP'ST THOU ME'
NATION=>I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD

PARKER=>Does this belong to you?
JANET=>When do I get to see Brad?
BERT=>After breakfast. You're sounding tense, Janet. Maybe I could give you a little massage?
BERT=>In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
NATION=>They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
NATION=>Mac's waiting in wardrobe, Janet. Nice to see you up and about, Bert. Care to join me in an on-set snack?
JANET=>I want to see Brad.
MAC=>I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself. Look at yourself.
MAC=>You're beautiful!
MAC=>More beautiful than any film star. And I should know. In the old series they came and went in every episode.
JANET=>Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
MAC=>Absolutely true. Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
MAC=>You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
JANET=>If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
MAC=>He will. But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings. You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous. And Farley's given you that chance. You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
JANET=>Do you really think so?
MAC=>You've got a really tight team around you. And everybody needs you!
JANET=>But what'll I do? What'll I say? What'll I wear?
MAC=>EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
