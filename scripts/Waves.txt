MOTION....=>.... The CAMERA tilts up to find the back of bicycle tires and two feet pedaling... ... We lift higher to discover a GIRL riding the bike. The girl’s hair blows through the wind... ... The girl slowly takes her hands off the handle bars... She stretches her arms out to her side and lifts them into the air... She opens her hands to let the wind rush between her finger tips... She looks free, like she is flying.... ... The CAMERA tilts up, past the girl, and stares directly into the sun. The light is blinding and it gives way to a splash of beautiful colors that are alive and bright as they flow in and out of each other... We see green, blue, yellow, orange, etc... ... We continue to take in the music as the colors begin to merge and morph... Different images begin to take shape... ‘FloriDada’ by Animal Collective slams on. The beat grows with a rush of images... They range from the macro to the micro; waves, trees, stop signs, cats, Everglades, hands, shells, ghettos, sand, cows, seagulls, gators, mailboxes, fish, golf courses... The first verse hits and the images continue to shoot by; street lights, cars, lakes, suburbs, scales, plants, manatees, eyes, malls, shopping centers, lizards, skyscrapers, grass, beaches, clouds, rain, trailer parks, dogs, houses, ducks, a variety of people that range in class, size, gender, and race.....

BOOM=>Tyler does a fast fireman’s carry and slams his opponent to the ground. The crowd cheers. Tyler keeps him on his back and crawls up to where he gets his opponent in a half nelson... Tyler is already going for the pin when Tyler’s face begins to grimace from pain... Tyler can’t quite get both of his opponent's shoulders on the mat, but he continues to push...
BAM=>The ref hits the mat. Tyler has won. The ref raises Tyler’s hand and the crowd cheers... Tyler immediately goes back to where he was warming up and he looks frustrated as he rolls his shoulder around. Ronald watches from the bleachers... INT. GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT Tyler and Ronald are back in the garage, this time on the miniature wrestling mat. Ronald has Tyler on the ground, wrapped up in a similar grip that Tyler had his opponent in, except Ronald is showing Tyler a better grip. By the look on Tyler’s face, it seems painful.
ALEXIS=>I love goats, too-
ELENA=>It’s not too much!

BOOM=>Tyler sweeps the wrestler’s leg and throws him to the ground. Tyler stays on top as he takes his arm and rubs it all over the wrestler’s face, really forcefully... By doing this, Tyler is forcing the inside of the kid’s mouth to clash against his braces... Eventually, Tyler gets up. The other wrestler rolls over and coughs up blood... Tyler can’t help but feel bad... INT. RONALD’S OFFICE - NIGHT Catherine’s voice echoes through the house as it plays from Ronald’s computer speakers:
TYLER=>What do you mean-
RONALD=>RONALD
TYLER=>Yeah... I hear you.
BOOM=>Tyler does a fast fireman’s carry and slams his opponent to the ground. Tyler keeps him wrapped up after the takedown, and he’s already trying to pin him. This is pulling on Tyler’s shoulder like crazy as the pain goes from intense to excruciating... It’s too much to take. Tyler lets go and his opponent gets loose. Tyler stands and returns to the neutral position.
BOOM=>Tyler’s opponent gets Tyler in a single leg takedown and takes Tyler to the ground. ‘Je vous hais petites filles’ by M83 begins to seep in. Tyler scrambles, but his opponent rides him. Both of Tyler’s shoulders are stretched overhead for support. The pain flows as Tyler continues to try and get loose... The ref’s WHISTLE blows - the period ends. Pain is shooting up Tyler’s entire arm as he goes down to take the defensive starting position... Ronald and Catherine yell from the stands... Tyler’s opponent gets on top... The ref’s WHISTLE blows and period two begins. Tyler stands to get free, but his opponent slams him back to the ground... This continues for a good minute... Finally, Tyler is able to stand and get loose.
BOOM=>Tyler is slammed to the ground with a double leg take down. When they hit the ground, Tyler’s shoulder is stretched out and over his head. On impact, the pain is so unbearable that Tyler can barely move. Everything goes to SLOW MOTION as Tyler’s opponent wraps him up and goes for the pin.... Tyler tries to fight back... Tyler looks up and sees Coach Wise and the team yelling from the bench... His parents yelling from the bleachers...
BAM=>The ref hits the mat. Tyler has lost. Tyler’s opponent gets up to claim victory. Tyler tries to get up, but he can’t. He lays down, unable to move his shoulder... The pain is unbearable...
ALEXIS=>I love you too...
TYLER=>Should I just drop you off and find park- I don’t know- I can find parking- Fuck- okay...
ALEXIS=>Can we please go??
ALEXIS=>I couldn’t do it- I couldn’t do it...
ALEXIS=>I don’t know... I thought I could, but I don’t know- I don’t know- I’m just confused- We need to talk about it again-
TYLER=>I can’t believe I’m having this conversation- I don’t give a shit! This isn’t about your fuckin mom! We are seniors in highschool! We’re going to college next year! This would ruin all of that.
TYLER=>Why would I care about an insane person’s point of view-
TYLER=>I’ve missed you so much
