BERNARDO=>Ready.
BERNARDO=>Are you chicken?
ACTION=>Get him, Tony!
MARIA!=>[Another police whistle, closer now, but he doesn't move. From the shadows, Anybodys appears. She scurries to Tony and tugs at his arm. A siren, another whistle, then a searchlight cuts across the playground. Anybodys' insistent tugging brings Tony to the realization of the danger. He crouches, starts to run with her to one escape way. She reaches it first, goes out-but the searchlight hits it just as he would go through. He stops, runs the other way. He darts here, there, and finally gets away as a distant clock begins to boom.]
MARIA=>I am: crazy!
