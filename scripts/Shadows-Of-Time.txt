VINCE=>A shadow from time.
POLICE OFFICER=>What’s in the coat pocket?
BLARING.=>The Mugger comes up behind Vince.
MUGGER=>Gimmie the money man.
SHERRIE=>As little as you had before?
SHERRIE=>Aren’t you the man with all the time in the world, but still not enough time to help me understand why?
END TITLES AND CREDITS=>SCOTT, 32 years old, tall, intelligent looking enters the room.
SCOTT=>They’re all beautiful. Which one is she?
VINCE=>They had planes in nineteen sixty five Scott.
VINCE=>I’m good to go.
SCOTT=>Forget it Vince. It isn’t going to happen.
SCOTT=>What are you doing with my pictures Vince?
SCOTT=>No to hanging the pictures Vince. Throw them out. I bled long enough for her.
VINCE=>What should I wear?
SCOTT=>Well let’s see, it’s the middle sixties, the hippie movement has just begun, come with me, I have just the outfit you need.
SCOTT=>The crystals emit syloneon radiation which
VINCE=>Scott, you haven’t traveled yet have you?
CABBIE=>I don’t take fake diamonds.
CABBBIE=>Hippies with their long hair. You don’t know if you’re looking at a guy or a girl anymore.
CABBIE=>More than alright. Thanks.
CABBIE=>Buddy the way you tip, you have just hired yourself a personal chauffeur. My cab is yours and you can just me Cabbie.
FULLER CRAIG=>My name is Fuller Craig of Craig’s Jewelry Store, I’m calling in reference to last years theft of the museum diamonds.
FULLER CRAIG=>I think I just purchased
VINCE=>I need to be there tomorrow night, before the show ends.
FULLER CRAIG=>Positive. When I called you I had only examined the diamonds through my eyepiece, but when I checked them under the scope I found them not to be the museum stones.
SHERRIE=>I’m looking forward to this dance routine Barbara.
DELEVERY BOY=>Delivery for Miss Sherrie Evans.
SHERRIE=>Don’t even think that thought on me. Ralph wouldn’t send me flowers even if I died. Dating him was the biggest mistake I ever made.
SHERRIE=>You’ll always be the other part of me, if not for real then in a fantasy. I’d rather dream than face reality, if real life is you not knowing me.
BARBARA=>Maybe there’s a card inside with a name on it. Open it. I want to see the flowers too. Open it.
BARBARA=>What else does it say?
BARBARA=>If this Vince looks anything like the way he writes, we’re taking gem mint here.
BARBARA=>What do you mean what should you do? You go out after the show and meet him.
SHERRIE=>Where are you going? BARBARA
SHERRIE=>Yes and no to what?
BARBARA=>Yes I saw him and no I didn’t say anything.
BARBARA=>What’s that, a life time supply of penicillin?
KELLY=>Oh, shaking. See you two amateurs on stage. And try not to mess up the routine Sherrie, being this is your first time out there.
SHERRIE=>She isn’t worth it.
VINCE=>Uh huh. Yeah, yes.
SHERRIE=>My you are the poet.
SHERRIE=>That would be nice. VINCE
SHERRIE=>Is there a problem?
VINCE=>I’ve only been in L-A a few days. I’m not familiar with the city.
SHERRIE=>I meant do you like Chinese food?
VINCE=>Whatever you want?
SHERRIE=>You’ve seen me dance?
VINCE=>On the internet.
SHERRIE=>What’s an internet? VINCE
VINCE=>I don’t think so.
CABBIE=>Sure. I’ll call the police from there.
YOUNG WOMAN=>I don’t know who saved me. I was unconscious at the time.
VINCE=>How can one mind the touch of an angel?
VINCE=>I guess it was the emotion of the situation. Just came out different.
VINCE=>A large pie with the works.

G-A-B-R...=>ahh, S-H-L-E-L-E.
KELLY=>Hi lover boy, I like the flowers.
SHERRIE=>I’m sorry about that Vince. Her and I have been at it since seventh grade. Her name’s Kelly Marlene...
SHERRIE=>Not that I want to but I’m going to have to leave soon. I have an early rehearsal tomorrow.
SHERRIE=>Of course. Tomorrow night? At the studio? Same time?
SHERRIE=>What is your problem?
STOCK BROKER=>Not necessarily, but the company he wants stock in doesn’t exist. He said it won’t until the year nineteen seventy five. Since this company doesn’t exist I can tell you the name if you so wish.
SHERRIE=>No stay. He was just leaving.
RALPH=>Who the hell is Tom Petty?
SHERRIE=>You’re gentle, but tough when you need to be. You’re a dreamer and a realist all at the same time. You help others and you make me feel as if
SHERRIE=>What just happened? VINCE
SHERRIE=>I love you Vince Gabriel. My words are not as poetic as yours but my feelings are.
VINCE=>Because you have. Before time was, we were.
SHERRIE=>I can confirm that.
VINCE=>Am I under arrest?
VINCE=>I know. It’s probably nothing. Right now there’s something very important I need to tell you.
VINCE=>Have you seen the movie The Time Machine?
SHERRIE=>You’re telling me you came here from the future?
SHERRIE=>Do you know me then?
SHERRIE=>The entire northeast is going to lose power?
SHERRIE=>Not that hard Vince.
VINCE=>I can, with this.
SHERRIE=>Yes it would. The emotion of surprise would be gone. And I like surprise.
SHERRIE=>First time hearing a whale sing?

SHERRIE=>I accept with all my heart, all my body, and all my soul, Mister Vince Gabriel.
BARBARA=>I’d love to meet him.
SHERRIE=>All this because of a mistake on an unpaid pizza bill?
SHERRIE=>How much is the bail?
BARBARA=>I have some money saved. You can use it to get Vince out.
BARBARA=>Right now you need it
SHERRIE=>Yeah, Pennsylvania. BARBARA
SCOTT=>You have to come back to your own time Vince.
VINCE=>No way. I go back I can’t return, I’ll lose Sherrie. Why would you even suggest that Scott?

VINCE=>What about Sherrie? SCOTT
SCOTT=>I don’t have that information. It could
VINCE=>I can’t just leave without seeing her. SCOTT
SHERRIE=>Excuse me. I’m here to post bail for Vince Gabriel.
SHERRIE=>His lawyer did, last night. Was Vince here? BARBARA
BARBARA=>Don’t go thinking the worse. He probably has a ton of paper work to fill out with his lawyer and he just didn’t get the chance to come over or call. He’ll be here tonight. Now you better get ready for rehearsal.
BARBARA=>I have to run, dad’s birthday tonight.
CABBIE=>Mister Gabriel been teaching you Chinese? SHERRIE
SHORT TIME PASSES.=>Sherrie is watching the TV news thinking maybe Vince was in an accident and she will hear something. There is news on the Viet Nam war, on protesting the war, a clip of President Johnson, and a one car accident.
SHORT TIME PASSES.=>Sherrie picks up the phone.
SHERRIE=>This is Sherrie Evans, I’m a guest in Vince Gabriel’s room. If you see Mister Gabriel will you please tell him I’m here?
SHERRIE=>You didn’t see him anywhere, did you?
BARBARA=>I’m not following you here Sherrie. What do you mean, his own time?
SHERRIE=>Alright.
BARBARA=>If someone finds it and learns how to use it, they may find out things they aren’t supposed to know. It could be a doomsday machine. SHERRIE
CABBIE=>All the north east states and parts of Canada are blacked out. Millions are without power. Some stations are reporting the bomb was dropped.
BARBARA=>Trust me, I just know.
KELLY=>I’d do it to you.
RALPH=>He’s lucky he left because I was gonna lay into him.
BOY’S FATHER=>Management said no one filed a claim for this, what ever it is, so if you want it Bill, it’s yours.
BARBARA=>I’m worried about you Sherrie.
CABBIE=>Miss Evans, Mister Gabriel asked me to give this to you after an allotted period of his absence. That time has now come.
BARBARA=>See you later Cabbie.
BARBARA=>Something important? SHERRIE
KELLY=>I have something that will make you feel
SHERRIE=>Vince?
SHERRIE=>I’m sorry. I thought you were someone I knew.
YOUNG MAN=>I understand. Well, I hope you find your Vince. Good Day.
SHERRIE=>Vince!
SCOTT=>This room is in as bad a shape as you are. VINCE
SCOTT=>She’s also in Los Angeles.
SCOTT=>You get yourself straight, you stay straight and I’ll tell you where she is. VINCE
SCOTT=>I know you didn’t.
END FLASHBACK=>PRESENT TIME
VINCE=>Sherrie I still...
SHERRIE=>And so I have to fantasize about what could have been, and wait for time to bring to me the dream which I live in.
KELLY=>Lover boy? No, that’s impossible.
VINCE=>Ten good years with Sherrie is worth a hundred lifetimes without her. Scott, you have to send me back.
SCOTT=>You’d be changing history.
SHERRIE=>I’m not comparing, I’m asking forgiveness.
VINCE=>Thank you Cabbie.
SHERRIE=>Vince?
SHERRIE=>Yes Sister Delores?
VINCE=>Scotty this is my beautiful wife Sherrie, Sherrie this is my brother Scott. He’s a genius.
SHERRIE=>Her name is Barbara. She’s my best friend and she knows all about you.
VINCE=>Far out of sight.
SCOTT=>I want to, she’s beautiful, but I’d be changing history. And twenty years in Alaska.
VINCE=>And we’ll all be together. Plus we can get our age difference back on track. So just do it Scotty. Scott stands up and paces.
SCOTT=>It’s a very minute explosion, loud but harmless. I discovered this the last time you
SCOTT=>Thanks, but I think I’ll just wear a suit.
SHERRIE=>I would like to meet them.
VINCE=>Feels like a dream, when I’m holding you. Every dream it seems, in you has come true. Hold me in your smile, touch me with your kiss. No heaven’s not above, it’s in our glow of love.
