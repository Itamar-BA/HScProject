DICKENS=>I have no doubt.
DICKENS=>Plorn. Don’t hide there.
DICKENS=>...but without our author-
MARIA=>Frank!..Frank!!
COLLINS=>Prince Frederick!
COLLINS=>Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.
MARIA=>Thank you Mama.
GEORGE=>Ah good. Thank you Mary.
NELLY=>But I will find you one.
BENHAM=>May I join you?
NELLY=>I was a child.
VICTORIAN LADY=>Truly Mr. Dickens it is never so alive as when it is spoken by its author.
MRS TERNAN=>Mr. Dickens, it was remarkable. Such control, such mastery in your performance.
DICKENS=>...they did so enjoy being away.
MARIA=>I will..again.
DICKENS=>My dear Buckstone-
NELLY=>Why didn’t you?
MRS TERNAN=>Let me show you out.
MRS TERNAN=>If lacking in space.
DICKENS=>Thank you. Thank You..Goodness..I did not believe we would raise so much money...Where does one begin?
MRS TERNAN=>Such an achievement.
DICKENS=>We must celebrate.
DICKENS=>Yes of course yes.
MRS TERNAN=>We shall not be late.
NELLY=>Nearly one thousand five hundred pounds.
DICKENS=>Good...I suppose.
NELLY=>And you are not.
MARIA=>Open your eyes.
NELLY=>You find us in disarray.
CATHERINE=>Happy Birthday Miss Ternan.
CATHERINE=>That is a silly question. He is Mr Charles Dickens..Even in those early years together even I could not fail to be impressed. But you will find, you must share him with his public. They will be the constant and in truth you will never absolutely know which one he loves the most. You or them. I do not believe he knows himself. But they will not give him up, of that you can be sure, Miss Ternan. They will love him beyond the grave.
MRS TERNAN=>Yes. Do you like it?
DICKENS=>Say you will come?
CAROLINE GRAVES=>May I take your wrap and gloves?
CAROLINE GRAVES=>Does this offend you Miss Ternan?
NELLY=>And when your wife asked me...when she asked me if I was fond of you... I could not honestly reply. I wanted to say ‘No’-
NELLY=>How very clever.
CATHERINE=>No matter. You must deny it.
MRS TERNAN=>I have witnessed some of the strongest friendships, some of the most lasting unions between men and women who were never married. I have envied them.
NELLY=>Yes I remember.
NELLY=>Let us go away.
NELLY=>You will. Paris.
DICKENS OOV=>I’ll do what I can...
NELLY=>You will come to see me?
NELLY=>There is nothing to say.
ALL=>Bravo..Bravo.
