CONTINUED=>CONTINUED
HORNSBY=>My, oh my! Look at this!
CONTINUED=>CONTINUED
HORNSBY=>Hey! Batter up!
CLARK=>looks like he'd love to take a mighty cut. Instead he misses completely.
CLARK=>I think I'll hold out for a real farmer, Mr. Hornsby.
CLARK=>Oh well, bye Lois.
ONE DEPUTY=>You better be breakin' a sweat, Luthor, or we'll feed you to the wolves!
TALL MARSHALL=>Oh, yeah, I seen one in a magazine Once.
KID=>Go on, get in. Only way to hear it.
FAT MARSHAL=>What's going on?
THE EDGE INTO=>THE QUARRY and EXPLODES. The KID turns and scrambles until he finds LUTHOR.
LEX=>Just because I use my genius in criminal ways. . . doesn't mean I'm not a firm believer in law and order. You men belong in prison!
LENNY=>Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
LEX=>Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
LOIS=>She made her money the old fashioned-way. She inherited it.

CLARK=>Why is Lois speaking French?
LACY=>Not so fast!
TEACHER=>Anyone else ...
JEREMY=>No, Superman.
ANOTHER GIRL=>You're probably best friends.
JEREMY=>'Dear Superman . . . '
GUIDE=>Superman has graciously donated a strand of His hair to the museum. So we all could have the fun of seeing how strong he really is. Here you can see a 1000-pound globe easily suspended by his single hair.
LEX=>Guess who! . . . Of course it's me! Your old buddy! Lex Luthor . . . Hey, you don't look too bad yourself. 'Course I've put on a few pounds, but what the hey! They feed you a lot of starch when you've in prison. That was 'prison' . . . as in where you put me, Mr. Clean. Say, we should get together soon. Over lunch, over dinner, or ... over your dead body.
CLARK=>I really don't think . . .
LOIS=>This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
LACY=>I think there's an angle.
SUPERMAN=>I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
JEREMY=>Well, I don't understand.
LEX=>I am ... smarter than I thought. It's working! Quick, Lenny. Prepare the Nuclear Chamber . . . Lenny? Lenny! . . . LEONARD!
LEX=>Get the radiation suits!
LENNY=>He called you father. What a . . . moron! He needs something to wear too, Uncle Lex. Unless you want to let him out looking like this!
NIGHT SPOT=>TONIGHT! A WHO'S WHO OF METROPOLIS TO ATTEND!
NUCLEAR MAN=>Yes . . . f-f-faaather. . .
LACY=>You're late. Very late.
COUPLE=>out of the way.
CLARK=>I've never been in a place like this before.
CLARK=>Remember me?
CLARK=>Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
ONE BOUNCER=>You got a pass, Mister?
LIGHTS=>turning all the guests into pulsing images. The NUCLEAR MAN bumps into dancers, knocks over drinks, collides with waitresses, upending their trays. A walking disaster zone.
LACY=>Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went dancing . . . for a story . . .
LOIS=>This time he's gone too far.
WAITER=>Look, up in the sky . . . It's . . .
U.N.=>PATROLMEN, one CHINESE, one SWEDISH, stand guard at the doors to the assembly. They turn to see SUPERMAN leading a small army of citizens behind him.
SWEDISH PATROLMAN=>I don't think he needs one.
JEREMY=>N-no...I mean...you bet.
SECRETARY GENERAL=>I believe that will do. Please.
LOIS=>Something . . . wonderful.
SENATOR=>I trust Superman.
HOWLER=>Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
LEX=>And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
LEX=>Don't!...Then the world will have eternal peace and you boys will have to find day jobs. Just remember, the more fear we make, the more loot you take. As long as the world hangs on the brink of war, the good life is available to every criminal . . . regardless of race, religion or natural origin!
AMENDMENT NO.3=>86
CLARK=>Maybe I should sit this one out.
PAUL=>I guess your friend doesn't know his own
PAUL=>No pain, no gain.
CLARK=>Gee, I don't think . . .
PAUL=>Well . . .!
LEX=>There!
LEX=>What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
CONTINUED=>CONTINUED
LACY=>What's that?
LOIS=>Oh, my God! Dinner ! Don't budge , I'll be right back.
CLARK=>Oh . . . my . . .
SUPERMAN=>They're back.
CLARK=>I better go wash this off before the stain sets.
LOIS=>Now they're both gone. This getting ridiculous.
NUCLEAR MAN)=>Look closely at his cell structure. See anything
LEX=>I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better -- he needed more energy, more power.
FATHER=>She must still be in the house!
SUPERMAN'S=>face. SUPERMAN starts blowing his ICY SUPERBREATH.
LACY=>I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
WARFIELD=>Yes, darling?
SENATOR=>Mr. Howler, I will give your associate Lex Luthor one chance to explain why we should listen to him - a known international outlaw -- instead of throwing him in jail forever. And investigating you.
LEX=>A reason 'Why'? . . . Superman tricked you!
EVERYTHING IS OUT=>then collapses on the floor.
CONTINUED=>CONTINUED
NUCLEAR MAN=>I will return for you.
LACY=>Ask me. It's about time I did something for someone else.
NUCLEAR MAN=>Where is she?
MAN=>notices. He lunges at SUPERMAN, felling him with a tremendous blow. SUPERMAN cannot get up to stop him.
SUPERMAN=>turns away and goes to straighten the American flag which has been knocked over in the titanic struggle.
NUCLEAR MAN=>Lacy? Lacy!!
LENNY=>Lucky I brought my drums.
LACY=>Say goodbye to Superman for me.
WALL 0F=>CHINA."
JEREMY=>I'll try. . .
