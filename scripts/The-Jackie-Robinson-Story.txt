NARRATOR=>In 1919 American professional baseball, slowed down by World War I, was picking up speed again. It had its Babe Ruth who was astounding the country by hitting 29 homers for Boston, its Ty Cobb then winding up a Hall of Fame career by leading the American League in hitting with a .384 average, Ty's great contemporary in Cleveland, Tris Speaker, its great pitchers, Walter Johnson, Burleigh Grimes, Herb Pennock... And, down in Georgia, it had something else... coming up. Name? Jackie Robinson. Race? Negro. Occupation? Infant in his mother's arms.
NARRATOR=>In the family history of every living American, except for the American Indian, there is the story of migration and settling and re- settling. Either the American himself, or an ancestor, had to travel to get where that American is today. Jackie Robinson was raised in Pasadena, California. This is how his mother, a widow, brought him and his brothers and sisters out of Georgia.
NARRATOR=>They had never seen anything like the city that was to be their new home. They looked and wondered and the mother told herself that sooner or later they would be well, if humbly, settled there... And -- in time -- they were... and very humbly...
NARRATOR=>This isn't Jackie -- but when he was nine, and the family couldn't afford to get him a baseball glove, this is how his mother helped him make a necessary adjustment to life. Jackie had found an old, dilapidated glove...
NARRATOR=>Between work and school Jackie, like this boy, didn't have all the time in the world to play...
NARRATOR=>...but he always kept his glove handy...
NARRATOR=>All the things that boys find to do when they have to work through their schoolhood years, Jackie did...
NARRATOR=>...yet he managed to make time for sports as well.
NARRATOR=>This still isn't Jackie, but when he attended Pasadena Junior College he led in all sports, broke the National Junior College running broad jump record with a leap of 25 feet, six inches -- a record set a few years earlier by his own brother, Mack!
NARRATOR=>But this -- IS -- Jackie Robinson...
NARRATOR=>...playing football for the University of California at Los Angeles where he had won an athletic scholarship.
NARRATOR=>Against Southern California!
NARRATOR=>Against Oregon!
NARRATOR=>Against Stanford! Etc.
WHITE GIRL=>Jackie sure can run! How does it feel to see your future husband going wild down there?
RAE=>Future husband? You're faster than he is! He hasn't got that far yet.
WHITE GIRL=>Now don't pretend, Rae! We know. Don't we, Claire?
WHITE GIRL=>So don't pretend, Rae!
NARRATOR=>It wasn't all touchdowns and cheers, however. There was also work...
JACKIE=>That's the last one, Jake.
JAKE=>I saw you play yesterday.
JACKIE=>Yeah? Like the game?
JAKE=>It was good. You was good. But what's the use if you got to do this kind of work? I didn't have to go to no college to get this job.
JACKIE=>You see, Jake, you're smarter than I am.
NARRATOR=>And there was always studying to be done.
RAE'S VOICE=>Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
RAE=>Stay put. I was held up by Claire King. She just wanted to talk.
JACKIE=>That's okay. I can use all the time I can get for this.
RAE=>Oh. Then I'll go.
JACKIE=>Did you say something?
RAE=>Your book! What about your book?
JACKIE=>What about you?
VOICES=>Jackie's down! Wow! They sure got him that time!
GIRL=>They sure pile on to him!
BOY=>What do you think? Who wouldn't if they had a chance to slug...
TRAINER=>Hurt much?
JACKIE=>Yes.
TRAINER=>Hip's badly bruised.
PLAYER=>I don't know what's wrong with those guys giving it to Jackie like that. Just because he's...
TRAINER=>Hold it! I knew before the game they were out to watch Jackie close. The trainer on their team told me. But it was because of his playing ability and nothing else.
PLAYER=>Oh.
TRAINER=>You better get back to the bench. I wasn't kidding about that either, Jackie. They had respect for you out there. Plenty.
JACKIE=>Thanks, Dick. It's nice to know.
TRAINER=>Say, Jackie. How's your brother Mack? I remember him when he went to the University of Oregon... and when he ran in the Olympics overseas. One of the finest athletes I ever met.
JACKIE=>Oh, Mack? He's fine. Fine, thank you.
RAE=>Still in some pain, aren't you? I think football is a wild game. I don't think I like it.
JACKIE=>I don't myself right now.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE=>I think it's disgusting... young men battering each other... no better than just plain old bulls.
JACKIE=>Well, it won't last much longer.
RAE=>Why? What are you going to do?
JACKIE=>Oh... something. This isn't getting me anywhere. I mean... this isn't getting us anywhere.
JACKIE=>And that's serious!
RAE=>Oh-h!
RAE=>She's cute.
JACKIE=>Yeah...
RAE=>What did you mean, Jackie? About your going to do something?
JACKIE=>Oh... I mean I'm too big to be just ornamental... Keeps Mom and Mack hustling to pay my way... I've got to start in being real useful...
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE=>Who is that? You, Jackie?
JACKIE=>Yes, mom.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE=>You sick?
JACKIE=>No. Just couldn't sleep. I'm going out to see Mack. Want to talk to him anyway.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE=>Can't it wait till morning? It's three o'clock.
JACKIE=>I know. But I won't be long. I know where to find him.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE=>Three o'clock! My! My! What a thing to do... what a thing to do...
JACKIE=>Hello, Mack.
MACK=>What the... what are you doing here at this hour? Schoolboys should be in bed.
JACKIE=>Yeah. I couldn't sleep so I fixed you some lunch. Here...!
MACK=>Man oh man -- I can use some... Hope you figured I was a bit hungry...
JACKIE=>You bet. Coffee, too.
MACK=>Now you're talking. Let's sit down and take it easy for a while...
MACK=>Anything bothering you?
JACKIE=>Yeah. I want to quit college. Right after the basketball season... when my scholarship is up.
JACKIE=>Take it easy, boy. I don't want to lose you now. You know Mom. She sees me as a doctor, minister or lawyer, perhaps. I'd like to please her but it just isn't in me...
MACK=>Yeah. I know.
JACKIE=>It would mean years more in school -- and the way I feel, I'd rather work at getting some kind of a sport job -- an assistant coach -- or a trainer -- something like that... But I can't figure out which to aim at... Coaching jobs are darn hard to get...
MACK=>All I can say, Jackie, is that you ought to stay in college as long as you can -- try to graduate -- and keep at sports as hard as you can. Something might turn up... and as far as education goes -- it'll do you good...
MACK=>How much good -- I'm not saying.
JACKIE=>Sure... I know... But I've got to go to work. I want to marry Rae. School's one thing -- but you and Mom can't support me in marriage.
MACK=>Funny place for a football hero to be sitting at this time of night...
JACKIE=>Funny job you've got for a university man...
MACK=>That's the way it is...
STUDENT=>Hey, Jerry! Going to watch basketball practice?
COACH=>All right, fellows. Let's work out in teams.
PLAYER=>That true, Jackie, about your quitting at the end of the basketball season?
PLAYER=>Not even going out for baseball again?
JACKIE=>No, I'm not.
PLAYER=>Don't you like baseball?
JACKIE=>Can't afford to like it!
PLAYER=>Why not?
JACKIE=>Ever hear of a Negro in organized ball?
PLAYER=>Well, don't think I'll miss you. I'll make the first team after you're gone.
JACKIE=>Well, I'll miss you. You kept me stepping.
PLAYER=>Get out! Kept you stepping! I didn't have a chance!
STUDENT=>"UCLA loses four-letter athlete. Jackie Robinson leaving school."
SECOND STUDENT=>He wasn't kidding.
THIRD STUDENT=>Gee, that boy's gonna leave a hole behind him hard to fill. How come?
STUDENT=>Economics, my boy. A man must live before he can play. And in order to live...
JACKIE=>...Coming out of Junior College to UCLA, the way I did, I only had a two-year scholarship to fit my athletic eligibility. Well... the scholarship is over.
TRAINER=>Isn't there any way you can stay on?
JACKIE=>My mother is 63 years old. She's worked as housekeeper, maid, cook, laundress, janitress and selling yard goods in a store to keep us kids going.
TRAINER=>She wanted to do it. She must not want to see you give up now.
JACKIE=>Yes, she'd work for the next ten years if I stayed in school...
TRAINER=>Well?
JACKIE=>Can't take a chance. I can't expect more future than Mack... and with all his college he wasn't able to get anything worth while. That's not worth ten more years of work for my mother.
JACKIE=>Luck to you, and I'll take the same.
TRAINER AND STUDENT=>All the luck in the world. You'll make out all right, Jackie.
TRAINER=>Somehow it doesn't make sense. The only four-letter man we've had at UCLA in ten years. High basketball scorer for us in both years he was here. On top of that he's as fine a baseball player as I have ever seen... and it don't mean a thing. He's walking out of here without anything ahead of him except a couple of games of pro-football signed up.
STUDENT=>Maybe he can have a career in professional football.
TRAINER=>Baseball is his game.
STUDENT=>He tells everyone he doesn't care about baseball.
TRAINER=>Yeah... I know. What else is he going to say?
MRS. ROBINSON=>What's that, Jackie?
JACKIE=>Money. Remember, Mom?
MRS. ROBINSON=>What is that, Jackie?
JACKIE=>Okay. Okay, Mom. It's an advance payment for playing professional football. I'm signed up to play for Honolulu.
MRS. ROBINSON=>But I don't like for you to play football. Is that why you quit college?
JACKIE=>No, Mom. I'm going there just to play a few games. They came to me when they heard I was going to quit. We can use the money till I get what I want. So I took it.
MRS. ROBINSON=>Honolulu's far away.
JACKIE=>I'll be there and back inside of two months.
JACKIE=>And then, maybe, I'll have some answers to all the letters I've been writing for a coaching job.
JACKIE=>It'll be all right, Mom. Just give me a little time and you'll be proud of me.
MRS. ROBINSON=>I was proud of you when you went to college.
JACKIE=>I know. But... I didn't feel proud of myself.
JACKIE=>...May take us a little longer this way but it means a better start...
JACKIE=>When it does... uh... Oh... maybe you're right. Maybe I'm just going around in circles.
RAE=>Jackie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act so cold to the idea. I'm not even listening because... because I just don't want you to go away.
RAE=>No. I know you have to do something like this to get a start. I know... but that doesn't make me like it.
JACKIE=>All right. And I am going around in circles. I don't know how to beat that. But Rae... there's one thing I want you to be sure of...
JACKIE=>Every circle comes right back to you.
JACKIE=>And all I'm worrying about is getting around fast enough!
RAE=>I have to take my post-graduate nursing course in a hospital. I think I can get in Bellevue in New York. That's where I'll be...
JACKIE=>But why so far...
RAE=>That's where I'll be when you're ready. It's better that way. Something for me to do. You're more free...
JACKIE=>All right.
JACKIE=>Hello, Mom...
MRS. ROBINSON=>I was hoping you'd be here -- your telegram came just a little while ago so I went out to get some things...
MRS. ROBINSON=>...you didn't get hurt, did you?
JACKIE=>Not a scratch. Got a sore arm though -- from writing letters...
MRS. ROBINSON=>Letters? Some letters came for you.
MRS. ROBINSON=>I put them here...
JACKIE=>I read them...
MRS. ROBINSON=>What's this National Youth Association...?
JACKIE=>It's something the Government set up to help underprivileged children --- they get all sorts of training ---
MRS. ROBINSON=>...And they want you to be an athletic instructor?
JACKIE=>Looks that way... Anyway, I'm taking it before they change their minds...
MRS. ROBINSON=>...Pennsylvania... You'll be near Rae, anyway...
MRS. ROBINSON=>Maybe you can be there when she graduates -- or whatever it is -- from the hospital...
JACKIE=>Yeah. So even if we don't have a doctor in the family, we'll have a registered nurse, anyway... ...I hope...
MRS. ROBINSON=>Why not write her and let her know...?
JACKIE=>Good idea. Soon's I put my stuff up...
RAE'S VOICE=>He can stop worrying now that he's in the Army...
ROOMMATE=>What you going to do with that?
JACKIE=>I don't know. Don't know if I'll ever do anything with it again...
RAE=>Just like you. First thing one sees when you unpack is a baseball glove... or a pair of spiked shoes...
JACKIE=>And when have you ever seen me unpack before, Miss Isum?
RAE=>I didn't mean that I had ever seen you... why, Jackie! What do you... Well, if that's to be your attitude!
JACKIE=>Excuse me. I have to effect a... a... a rapprochement, I think they call it.
MRS. ROBINSON=>What's he mean by that... that rapproche -- that stuff?
MACK=>Search me. We didn't bother with that kind of stuff when I went to college.
JACKIE=>H'ya, Jake.
JAKE=>You been out of the Army a long time now, Jackie. Ain't got yourself a good coaching job yet?
JACKIE=>Not quite.
JAKE=>Still writing letters, eh?
JACKIE=>Yes. But if I don't get an answer soon I'll be back here looking for my old job.
JAKE=>I hope that don't happen, son. But if it does... I can sure use you. Why don't you go to them coaching places in person instead of writing them letters?
JACKIE=>You mean why don't I spend fifty dollars train fare instead of a three cent stamp?
JAKE=>Yeah... I ain't got all the brains in the world. I wouldn't even want to prove I got my share!
MACK'S VOICE=>Jackie!
MACK=>It just came.
MACK=>It's from the Kansas City Monarchs. It can only be one thing... an offer.
JAKE=>Who are they?
MACK=>Never heard of the Kansas City Monarchs? It's a professional baseball team.
JAKE=>But I thought professional teams don't want us.
MACK=>It's an all-colored team.
GROUP=>Jackie looks up and Mack can't wait.
MACK=>Well?
JACKIE=>A hundred dollars a week... to play shortstop.
JACKIE=>And I didn't even write them. How did they know?
MACK=>Oh, they knew about you from UCLA and some of the pro games you played at Brookside. They must have scouted you.
JAKE=>Here. That's what it says... a hundred a week. Just pushing a little old baseball around. Maybe there's something to that college stuff after all.
RAE=>Well... you've got to take it. I don't see what else you can do.
JACKIE=>Yeah... and if I can stay with the Monarchs a couple of years I should be able to save up a little money. Maybe even enough... Maybe when I know I'm set there, then...?
JACKIE=>I don't blame you. Gee... a couple more years. Why don't we set a wedding date for about 1960 and have it over with?
RAE=>I don't know about 1960, but in five minutes I'm due back in the ward.
JACKIE=>And tomorrow I'm due in Kansas City.
MANAGER=>This being your first game I was going to hold you out a couple of innings but maybe you want to take a lick at bat now? Follow Joe.
JACKIE=>Okay.
MANAGER=>And look! Uh... we give them a show out there, Jackie. If you make an out, act mad. If you think you get a bad call on a ball, talk it up. They like that here.
ANNOUNCER=>Now batting for Kansas City Monarchs in place of Rumley -- Jackie Robinson!
CATCHER=>This is a new boy, Bill. Take it real easy with him. Don't discourage the new boy. Nice and easy! Nice and easy!
MANAGER=>That was great, Jackie! Fine stuff! They loved it.
MANAGER=>But, of course, you know...
MANAGER=>You're also supposed to get a hit once in a while
JACKIE=>Make up your mind.
SECOND BASEMAN=>About time you started hitting, boy.
SLIM=>Good going. You ought to sleep well tonight.
JACKIE=>I generally sleep pretty good.
SLIM=>On a bus?
JACKIE=>That's right. I forgot we travel by bus.
SLIM=>Make four hundred mile jumps between games. Only chance we ever get to hit a bed is in a two or three game series.
JACKIE=>Not so good.
SLIM=>It ain't de luxe, brother!
RADIO ANNOUNCER=>It's two and two on Greenberg as Feller winds up... and it's ball three...
SLIM=>Quiet, Leander! That's Hank Greenberg at bat. That Leander! He sleeps all day out in right field.
LEANDER=>I don't care if it's Duke Ellington! I want to sleep.
SLIM=>Come on, Hank. Wait it out... 'less it's good.
RADIO ANNOUNCER=>There's the windup again... and Greenberg SWINGS at a high one and he's out!
SLIM=>What he bite on that for? Ah-h... that's the game!
LEANDER=>Hey-y-y!
SLIM=>What you want now, Leander? I turned the radio off. Go to sleep.
LEANDER=>I ain't sleepy no more. I'm hungry.
SLIM=>Hungry? Why you... Hungry... How about you?
PLAYERS=>Yeah... hungry. I can eat. About time... gotta get out of here anyway. I'm for it!
DRIVER=>Don't look too bad...
DRIVER=>Whose turn? Let's not waste time...
SLIM=>Sixteen of us... in the bus outside. How's chances of getting a late dinner?
COUNTERMAN=>I'm all alone here. Afraid I couldn't handle you.
SLIM=>How about sandwiches? Could you have the chef make some up for us?
VOICE=>How many of you?
SLIM=>Sixteen.
CHEF=>Make you about sixteen beefs, sixteen ham and eggs. That be all right?
SLIM=>Swell. Some fried potatoes on the side, chef?
CHEF=>Yup. Take about twenty minutes.
COUNTERMAN=>Coffee for everybody?
SLIM=>Yeah... but don't pour it until the sandwiches are ready, please... so the coffee will be hot.
COUNTERMAN=>Just getting it ready, Bud. Just getting it ready.
SLIM=>Thanks.
SLIM=>You suppose we could wash up a bit?
COUNTERMAN=>Sorry. It's out of order.
SLIM=>Oh... Thanks. Then we'll go up the road and be back in fifteen minutes.
COUNTERMAN=>Have to leave a deposit on the sandwiches in that case.
SLIM=>Sure.
SLIM=>They're feeding us. That's all. I told them we're goin' up the line a bit.
OTHER NURSE=>'Morning, Rae. I read about your Jackie last night. He's been going great for months. He write you?
RAE=>Yes. He's doing well. Except he doesn't like the traveling.
OTHER NURSE=>Well, tell him to give it up and come back here and get a job.
RAE=>I sure feel like it.
OTHER NURSE=>That's the time to write.
RAE=>I'll wait. Waited this long.
SLIM=>What's the matter with you? Didn't you pitch and win yesterday?
JACKIE=>That's right. You were hot.
BILL=>Yeah... but there's no future to it.
SLIM=>What'ya mean?
BILL=>How much does a twenty game win pitcher get paid in the major league?
JACKIE=>I don't know. Thirty thousand up, maybe.
BILL=>That's right. And I've won thirty so far... and I'll get more.
SLIM=>And you ain't getting any thirty thousand.
BILL=>Funny boy.
JACKIE=>Think you could do as well in the majors?
BILL=>No. Not any thirty or more. But I'd sure come close to twenty...
JACKIE=>I think so.
BILL=>And maybe be able to save a few dollars for when my arm goes...
SLIM=>He's right. We're all in the same boat. Get enough to get by -- but nothing to put by.
SLIM=>Well...
SLIM=>...enough to get by -- but nothing to put by...
ANNOUNCER=>Jackie Robinson up again. He got a hit once and walked once. Let's see what he does now.
ANNOUNCER=>Ball one. Too low.
UMPIRE'S VOICE=>Ball two!
UMPIRE=>Ball!
ANNOUNCER=>Jackie is not biting. They've got the wrong man. It's ball three now and the pitcher's on the spot.
ANNOUNCER=>Ball four and Jackie walks again. He's got eyes, that boy.
SUKEFORTH=>Oh, Robinson! Can I see you a minute?
SUKEFORTH=>My name is Clyde Sukeforth. I'm with Branch Rickey... of the Brooklyn Dodgers...
SUKEFORTH=>I'll walk up to the dressing room with you. Talk to you there.
SUKEFORTH=>Branch Rickey wants to see you.
JACKIE=>What for?
SUKEFORTH=>Frankly, I don't know. Can you leave for Brooklyn tonight with me?
JACKIE=>Sure.
SUKEFORTH=>Great! I'm at the Palmer House. I'll arrange for our railroad tickets and suppose you phone me at the Palmer at seven?
JACKIE=>I'll do that, Mr. Sukeforth.
SLIM=>Who was that white man, Jackie? A friend of yours?
JACKIE=>Nope. Said he was a scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Said Branch Rickey wants to see me.
SLIM=>S'matter? You owe Rickey some money or something?
BILL=>Yeah... what does Mr. Rickey want to see you about?
JACKIE=>He didn't say. Just wants to see me. Maybe to see if I've got two heads or something.
SLIM=>What'd you say?
JACKIE=>He's getting the train tickets and I'm to phone him at seven at his hotel.
SLIM=>Better hurry up and pack. We'll miss you.
JACKIE=>You don't think I'm crazy, do you?
BILL=>You'll find a lot of these cranks showing up. I don't know what makes 'em do it. Last year I was signed to pitch for the Giants, Senators and Cincinnati.
SLIM=>But none of us have ever been signed for Brooklyn yet. That's a new one. You ought to take Bill and me out and show us a good time on the strength of that.
JACKIE=>On the strength of that I'm going to have dinner and go home to bed. It's been four days since we had a bed to sleep in and I'm going to get a nightful of it.
BILL=>You got something there...
JACKIE=>Who is it?
MAN'S VOICE=>Robinson? Clyde Sukeforth.
JACKIE=>Just a second!
SUKEFORTH=>What are you trying to pull, Robinson?
SUKEFORTH=>Playing hard to get or something...? Or just trying to make a fool out of me? Acting like a smart guy... making me miss my train... I should have taken it and not come here...
JACKIE=>Just a minute, Mr. Sukeforth -- if that's your name... I don't know you and you don't know me...
JACKIE=>...If Mr. Rickey did send you to see me, then I've made a big mistake -- and I'm sorry...
JACKIE=>It's still hard to believe... A lot of fellows come to the game and... you know.
SUKEFORTH=>Oh... You thought I was giving you the business! I should have thought of that...
SUKEFORTH=>When Mr. Rickey told me to come out here and talk to you, I didn't think I was hearing right myself... but here I am...
JACKIE=>And you said you don't know why he wants to see me.
SUKEFORTH=>I don't... Unless...
JACKIE=>After all, there's no chance for me in major league baseball.
JACKIE=>So... what...
SUKEFORTH=>The only thing I can think of... and I've got no right to suggest it... just between us...
JACKIE=>Yes?
SUKEFORTH=>There's talk about an all-Negro football team being started by Mr. Rickey... the Brown Dodgers...
JACKIE=>Oh... so that's it. Football.
SUKEFORTH=>I don't know. But he wants to see you and he's paying your fare... both ways if you come back... What do you say... yes or no?
SUKEFORTH=>You'll just have to make up your mind, quick. I can't tell you any more. I don't know any more.
JACKIE=>I... Okay.
SUKEFORTH=>Fine. Let's pack. We leave in an hour.
SECRETARY=>Hello, Mr. Sukeforth... Mr. Rickey is expecting you.
RICKEY=>Hello, Clyde! Got your man, eh?
RICKEY=>Come in, Jackie. I'm very glad to see you.
JACKIE=>How do you do, Mr. Rickey.
SUKEFORTH=>Yes, this is Jackie Robinson... and it looked for a while as if I wasn't going to get him here.
RICKEY=>Sit down, won't you? Oh, no? How come? Don't like Brooklyn?
JACKIE=>I've got nothing against Brooklyn. But... uh... on the Monarchs we get all kinds of men who show up and talk big about signing us up for this and that. It's a kind of a gag.
RICKEY=>Oh, sure! Sure! Sure! But didn't Clyde show you his credentials?
JACKIE=>Yes... we got together finally.
RICKEY=>Well, that's the main thing... And now...
JACKIE=>Yes, sir?
RICKEY=>You're wondering, naturally, why I sent for you.
JACKIE=>More than wondering, Mr. Rickey. I'm most curious. Although... I sort of figured it out for myself...
RICKEY=>You did?
JACKIE=>Well, I know you're starting an all- colored football team.
RICKEY=>Oh! Yes! Yes! We are thinking about that. But... that's not what I want you for. Jackie, I want you for baseball.
JACKIE=>You said that as if you were talking about organized baseball, Mr. Rickey. But I'm a Negro. There are none of us in big league ball. I don't understand...
RICKEY=>Why I should want to put a Negro into baseball?
JACKIE=>Yes.
RICKEY=>I'm going to tell you... And you, Clyde. Because I am going to have to tell many people.
RICKEY=>I have been looking for someone like you -- an intelligent, educated, good Negro ballplayer -- for some time. I needed a man whose character was well regarded and whose background was unblemished. As far as we can find out, you are such a man. You might as well know now... we've done a lot of checking up on you. I can tell you your life story from Georgia to where you are sitting now. It may be that you will be the first Negro in organized baseball.
JACKIE=>But...
RICKEY=>Why you? Let's get this straight so we can all understand it. It's too important for anyone to have a false impression. People are going to shoot at us... we must know where we stand. I didn't call you here because I want to do something for you, or for your race, or for the Brooklyn Ball Club. I want to do something for all of us... All of us Americans.
RICKEY'S VOICE=>...For years I have seen and watched Americans together in the grandstands and bleachers of our country's ball parks... Negroes, whites of all nationalities...
RICKEY'S VOICE=>...Italians, Irish, Swedes, Jews, Germans, Chinese, Russians, Japanese, Czechs... and I have marveled at their fellowship, their cheers, laughter, disappointments, enthusiasm, all as one... and all made so by the magic of a sport they all loved and appreciated equally. And I couldn't help ask myself a question... a long time ago... and hundreds of times since -- If Americans can find such a common meeting ground in a game... the game of baseball... If they can play together like this... why can't they live together like this... in the game of life?
RICKEY=>And... I know they can... and maybe baseball can show the way... because baseball is wholly and peculiarly American.
RICKEY=>That's why I called you here, Jackie. Do you want to get in on it? Because it starts with you!
JACKIE=>If I'm strong enough. If I should be the one on whom this all depends.
JACKIE=>I can try. For all I've got.
RICKEY=>That should be enough. But I want you to know exactly what you are getting into. I'll do my part. You mustn't let me, or all of us, down. Jackie, we can't start you with Brooklyn. It wouldn't be fair to both of us. We don't know if you're major league or not.
RICKEY=>We'll let you try out for Montreal, one of our farm teams, and later hope you make Brooklyn. But aside from that, if and when we announce you for even Montreal... do you know what's going to happen? The papers? People? Other players? Other clubs? The reaction in the south?
RICKEY=>And if we get over that and you actually start with Montreal -- Will you stand what you're going to have to go through? The razzing... the cruel, unfair razzing that every player gets, and the special razzing, the special name-calling you're going to get. Can you stand it?
RICKEY=>Are you sure? Because... You're not going to be able to fight back... no matter what the offense. ...No matter what the offense! Do you understand?
JACKIE=>Can you use a ballplayer who hasn't the spirit... to fight back?
RICKEY=>That's what's going to make your job so tough. No! I want a fighter every time. I want a man in there for everything he's got! But... you'll have to take it... not fight back... and yet, do it so that somehow it's no discredit to you... so that somehow the crowd will sense it's not cowardice that is stopping you but something deeper. If, and when, you can put that over... your troubles are over. No player will bother you, no man will unfairly attack you by name or epithet, when you have established that with the baseball public. Because the very core of Americans is fair play... once they have felt the true situation involved.
RICKEY=>Jackie, I know from your background that you've been spiked and beaned in baseball, you've been clipped and two-way tackled in football, you've been banged around on the street. That's what you face now. And you don't dare yell copper... or fight back. You don't dare because more than you... much more than just you... hangs in the balance. Take a day to think it over. And think it over!
MACK=>I'm going, Mom. See you in the morning.
MACK=>Hello... Yes, yes...
MACK=>It's Jackie, Mom. He's calling from New York.
MRS. ROBINSON=>New York? What's he doin' there?
MACK=>Hello... Yeah, Jackie, it's me, Mack. What are you...? Huh?... The Dodgers?... The Dodgers!... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah...
MACK=>Yes, she's right here, Jackie. Just a minute, I'll tell her. Listen, Mom. Jackie's got a chance to try out for Montreal -- baseball -- and maybe go with the Brooklyn baseball team afterwards. He'll be the first Negro in real baseball. But he has to promise that no matter what kind of trouble happens -- and there'll be trouble --
MRS. ROBINSON=>Will he get hurt?
MACK=>Oh, not actually... but it could be nasty... you know. But he's got to promise not to fight back no matter what happens to him and he don't know if he can trust himself to take it. Feels he'll feel like only half a man. And if things go wrong on his account it might be the end of Negroes in baseball. He doesn't know what to do...
MACK=>What are you going to tell him?
MRS. ROBINSON=>Let me have the phone, Mack.
MRS. ROBINSON=>Jackie...?
JACKIE=>Hello, Mom! Mack tell you? What do you think, Mom...? What? What? Yeah... I feel all right. Yeah, I'm sure. I feel swell... But what about...?
MRS. ROBINSON=>We can't advise you, son. You have to talk to somebody with better judgment. Somebody in New York you can sit down with...
JACKIE=>But I don't know anybody in New York...
MRS. ROBINSON=>Yes, you do, son. In Harlem there are churches and good men at the head of them. Find one. Tell him. And listen. It means as much to him as it does to you and all of us.
JACKIE=>Yeah... maybe you're right, Mom. That does sound good.
MRS. ROBINSON=>...and take good care of yourself and let us know... What?... No, we won't tell anyone until you let us know... Yes, just Rae. Good-bye.
MACK=>That was good, Mom. How'd you happen to think he could go to some church and talk to a minister?
MRS. ROBINSON=>He needed help and it just naturally came to me he could go to church.
MINISTER=>I understand. It's quite a problem. Do you have time for a little walk, Mr. Robinson?
JACKIE=>A walk? Well... surely, if you like.
MINISTER=>Let's take one.
MINISTER=>That's your people.
MINISTER=>I know that if you don't make good... it may hurt us. But... ...we always can take hurt, if there is the chance to benefit.
JACKIE=>That means I take the chance.
MINISTER=>We all take the chance. The Lord has appointed you one of the rising men of your race. And we've got to be a rising people.
ANNOUNCER=>When Branch Rickey announced that Jackie Robinson had been signed and would play for the Montreal farm club there was plenty of excitement. Almost everybody had something to say about it -- and what's more -- they said it!...
ANNOUNCER=>...The talk came from high places in baseball as well -- with many a club owner declaring that they wouldn't stand for it. But there it was. What would they do about it? It is something we won't know until the season starts in a few weeks in Florida...
RAE=>You're sure you want me to come to Florida with you? I've never been south.
JACKIE=>I'm sure. I'm very sure. Not afraid, are you?... because of all this fuss in the papers? I've never been south either, since babyhood.
RAE=>A little. But that's not why I wonder about coming. I just don't want to be in your way. You'll be busy with all that spring training... people wanting to talk to you.
JACKIE=>Who'll want to talk to me? They talk about me... but not to me much. If you aren't there I'll just be alone once I'm off the field.
RAE=>Is that the way you figure it?
JACKIE=>Why... Dem's the conditions that prevail... like Jimmy Durante says.
RAE=>Well... if dem's the conditions, I'll see what I can do.
NEGRO=>Mr. Robinson?
JACKIE=>Yes?
NEGRO=>And Mrs. Robinson?
JACKIE=>That's right.
NEGRO=>My name is Gaines. I am an attorney in town. A group of us heard you were due here for spring training. We thought you might not have made arrangements for a place to stay.
JACKIE=>Why... we were going to find a hotel...
GAINES=>There is no suitable hotel, Mr. Robinson. That's why we talked it over. I'd be pleased to have you stop at my home while you are here as our guests. Such as it is, it is the only place available.
JACKIE=>That's very kind of you... but... why... we don't want to impose...
GAINES=>Not at all. You are a very important man to us. It will be our pleasure, I assure you.
JACKIE=>Thank you.
REPORTER=>...Think you're good enough to make the Dodgers?
JACKIE=>Don't know if I'm good enough to make the Montreal team -- so I'm not even thinking about the Dodgers...
2ND REPORTER=>What'll you do if a pitcher tries to bean you?
JACKIE=>Same as you would. Duck.
3RD REPORTER=>You hope to be a Dodger sometime, don't you?
JACKIE=>Sure -- provided I'm good enough...
4TH REPORTER=>What about the other players? You think there'll be any trouble?
JACKIE=>Trouble?
2ND REPORTER=>He means -- do you expect to get along with the other guys --- Suppose something happens -- then what? How'll it affect you...?
JACKIE=>That's too tough for me to answer. All I can say is that I'm going to do my best -- as a player and on and off the field... How it'll turn out -- I don't know any more than you do...
TRAINER=>Sorry, boys -- but you'll have to continue this later -- right now Robinson's due on the field...
TRAINER'S VOICE=>Oh, Mr. Hopper!
TRAINER=>Jackie -- this is Mr. Hopper -- Manager of the Montreal Royals -- Mr. Hopper -- Jackie Robinson...
REPORTER=>Got a few minutes for us, Mr. Hopper...?
HOPPER=>Certainly -- but let me get Jackie out there first...
HOPPER=>Boys... this is Jackie Robinson. That's Harker, Billings and Piletti. Catch with them a while.
HARKER=>Glad you did that. I don't know how the heck we got into it.
HARKER=>Oh, great! Now you're leaving me out of it! Oh, fine!
HARKER=>Here... let me get a chance to throw once in a while!
MRS. GAINES=>You're sure you don't want to walk into town?
RAE=>Well... not yet.
MRS. GAINES=>All right. You're not nervous about it, are you? Afraid down here?
RAE=>Uh... to tell you the truth, I wouldn't be comfortable. I've never been south and I'm afraid I wouldn't know how to act. You probably don't understand but... when one isn't accustomed to... well, sort of deferring... or whatever it is down here... I'm afraid I'm not clear. Perhaps if you explained. I worry about making a mistake and getting Jackie into trouble.
MRS. GAINES=>I understand. Of course I do. But it really isn't as bad as reported. Some of what you hear is true... a lot exaggerated. We live our own lives... and as long as we live our own lives we are not bothered. Most of the white people understand our position and are helping, bit by bit, to make things better, easier. We've got to show respect for all of them -- whether we respect them or not. Always say Mister or Mrs. -- never use first names, even if they ask you to. None of those are hard to do, really. You do defer, but even that isn't hard -- once you get used to it.
RAE=>In what way?
MRS. GAINES=>Every way. In stores, say, don't try to get waited on until you're the only one left -- and give way even if you're first and they come in later... Never, of course, try or expect to mix --- and as long as they come first in everything -- you'll get along all right...
RAE=>Tell me -- why are you living here -- instead of up North...
MRS. GAINES=>To tell you the truth, I like it down here. Even so... I like it down here. If I left... it would be like running away from home. I couldn't do that.
RAE=>I like it, too. It feels like home... and yet...
MRS. GAINES=>And yet it's strange.
RAE=>Yes. Strange. Almost... mysterious.
JACKIE=>I'll be right home after practice.
JACKIE=>Hello, Mr. Gaines. I was just on my way to the field.
GAINES=>Not this morning, Jackie.
JACKIE=>Not this... Uh? What do you mean?
GAINES=>Come up on the porch. I had a call from Mr. Rickey. I'll tell you what he said.
GAINES=>The town has put a stop to mixed ball playing.
JACKIE=>You mean... on account of me?
GAINES=>Yes.
JACKIE=>Then... you mean I'm through? Is that what he said?
GAINES=>By no means! Mr. Rickey isn't giving up that easy. You're to train in another town.
JACKIE=>By myself? I don't get it.
GAINES=>Oh, no. With the others. Mr. Rickey's answer to the town was to decide to move the whole Brooklyn organization out of here to another town. Not far. You'll still stay here with us.
JACKIE=>And I... I'm the cause of all that?
MR. GAINES=>Don't hold yourself cheap, Jackie. Mr. Rickey thinks that you, and what you stand for, is worth it.
REPORTER=>From what I've heard, you had a good ballplayer in Robinson. But from what I've seen -- you've wasted your time -- and mine, too...
RICKEY=>Could be... but I don't think so... Pete -- tell Robinson I want him at first base...
1ST REPORTER=>He ever played first?
RICKEY=>Not that I know of...
1ST REPORTER=>Then why...
RICKEY=>Because he's been trying so hard he's thrown his arm out... it won't be so hard on him at first...
2ND REPORTER=>Just how bad is his arm, Mr. Rickey?
RICKEY=>From what I've heard, he can't even comb his own hair...
1ST REPORTER=>...and you're keeping him out there...?
RICKEY=>Sure.
RICKEY=>How long before his arm...?
TRAINER=>A week will bring it around...
RICKEY=>I suggest that you catch our first exhibition game -- two weeks from today...
1ST REPORTER=>Here?
RICKEY=>No -- Jacksonville...
2ND REPORTER=>I'll be there...
PLAYER=>How's about opening up?
POLICEMAN=>Not today, I'm afraid...
TRAINER=>What's the matter?
POLICEMAN=>Orders.
TRAINER=>Why not? Whose orders?
POLICEMAN=>Well -- there's a statute on the books that says white and colored can't compete against each other -- even in sports...
TRAINER=>Let's go...
2ND REPORTER=>Pete -- what's...
TRAINER=>Cancelled -- usual reason...
CYNIC=>Think you'll ever play a game down here?
TRAINER=>We'll play all right...
RICKEY=>...and I want you to use him -- trouble or not...
HOPPER=>Okay. Hey -- Robinson!
RICKEY=>Jackie -- I want you to play second today... Arm working all right?
JACKIE=>Yes.
RICKEY=>Give it all you've got today...
JACKIE=>I will, Mr. Rickey...
RICKEY=>I'm going to stay for awhile -- just in case.
HOPPER=>It'll probably take some time -- after they find out Robinson's in the game...
HOPPER=>Okay?
JACKIE=>Anything special?
HOPPER=>No -- use your own judgment...
RICKEY'S VOICE=>Watch him... See that stance -- see how he hugs the plate... He's hard to pitch to -- he'll walk at least one for four...
HOPPER=>Can I see you alone a moment, Mr. Rickey?
HOPPER=>We've just got word. Police are on the way. Mixed playing again.
RICKEY=>Better get him off the field, Clay... no use making it worse...
HOPPER=>Sorry, Jackie -- but you'd better leave the park for awhile... The old trouble. See you in the dressing room.
TRAINER=>Same old thing. Same old thing!
JACKIE=>Yeah, Pete. Thanks for looking at it my way but I bet you fellows are fed up with all the trouble I've caused. All the jumping around, cancelled games... ruction in the air.
PETE=>Yes, it's been a lot of fuss. But that's the game. We're getting paid for it. Not our business to squawk.
JACKIE=>It's the game... but I'll never get to play it, I'm afraid. I've got a hunch that maybe Mr. Rickey has enough, too... and maybe I'll be back with the Kansas City Monarchs in a few days... if they'll take me.
RICKEY=>Pete... better go out on the field and take a look at Hugh's hand. He caught one on the knuckles.
PETE=>Right.
RICKEY=>And you...
JACKIE=>Yes, Mr. Rickey. You going to give it to me now?
RICKEY=>Give you what?
JACKIE=>My walking papers. You must be caught up with all this melodramatic stuff... police chasing the team all the time.
RICKEY=>Oh. Yeah. Never had such excitement in years. I'll give it to you. Jackie... you are now officially a Montreal Royal. You have made the team. Okay?
JACKIE=>You're still with me!
RICKEY=>Still with you.
JACKIE=>And I was ready to give up!
HOPPER=>All right, Jackie?
JACKIE=>Yes, Mr. Hopper.
HOPPER=>Think I've got even better news for you.
JACKIE=>Better?
HOPPER=>For you. You can pack up. We head north tomorrow... for Jersey City and our first game of the season.
MRS. GAINES=>It is safe to say, Jackie, that this drink is not the only one to be raised in your honor tonight. It is safe to say that hundreds of thousands of our people are doing the same. You have opened another door formerly locked to us by intolerance. It is a milestone... I speak for a great many when I say... thank you... thank you...
RAE=>You're not supposed to drink now. You don't drink, anyway.
JACKIE=>I forgot...
COMMENTATOR=>...This was an unusual day in organized baseball, ladies and gentlemen. For the first time, a Negro player was presented to the public. And for his first time, a Negro made his appearance in the big time, his every instinct telling him the crowd might not be friendly at all. But whatever the feeling of the crowd before they saw Jackie Robinson today... they forgot it. Because he made them think of one thing... and one thing only... baseball! And what baseball! Few will forget what they saw... I can see it yet...
COMMENTATOR=>...But a lot of players hit home runs. He gave them more baseball than that. He gave them real baseball. When next he came to bat there were yells for another homerun. Jackie didn't hit a homerun. He showed the crowd something brand new... how to score on a bunt!
UMPIRE=>Pitcher's balk. You can score.
COMMENTATOR=>...Before that game was over Jackie had hit safely four times and scored four times, with the aid of two stolen bases and two pitcher's balks! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that was how the first day went for the first Negro in organized baseball. They probably won't all go that well... there may still be trouble... But we have an indication that Jackie Robinson has what it takes... to take hold of the public's heart!
VOICE=>Hey, dare, big boy! What you-all doin' on a white man's field?
THICK-NECK=>Better get your carcass out'a there before you get rode out!
THICK-NECK=>Get that black --
THICK-NECK=>-- off the field. Get him off the field!
MAN=>Here's a brother of yours, Jackie. Why don't you take him along? He wants to get into baseball, too.
COMMENTATOR=>...With the baseball season almost over, Jackie Robinson has proved himself one of the standout players in the International League. In his home town, Montreal, he is a hero. To the great majority of fans in other International League towns, he is also a favorite. There's no doubt of it. Jackie has made good here... but the biggest hurdle is ahead of him... the major league. The opposition is strengthening. There are going to be fireworks!
GAINES=>Just a minute, Clara. This is from Jackie Robinson.
MRS. GAINES=>Oh. Is he coming back here?
GAINES=>No. That's why he writes. He's on his way to Cuba. That's where Brooklyn and Montreal will train this year.
MRS. GAINES=>Does he think he can go with Brooklyn?
GAINES=>He says all he has to do is beat two hundred other men trying for the team.
MRS. GAINES=>Oh.
GAINES=>That's all right. He has to show he is able. The important thing is... ...he has nothing else against him. He, and all of us, have come that far, anyway.
MRS. GAINES=>Yes. Yes.
TRAINER=>Robinson! Mr. Rickey wants to see you!
JACKIE=>For me? This is a first baseman's glove.
RICKEY=>That's right. I want you to use it.
JACKIE=>I don't get it. Not play second, you mean? Mr. Rickey, I don't like first base. I'm not a first baseman. I did well at second last year.
RICKEY=>Jackie, your team begins a seven game practice series against Brooklyn today. I want you to play first. I want you to play like you've never played before. Last year at Montreal doesn't mean a thing. This is it. This is where you decide whether Brooklyn wants you... and by Brooklyn I don't mean me -- I mean the Brooklyn players. I want you to run them ragged, on the bases, in the field, at bat. Run wild. Steal their pants off. They know they are definitely weak at first. They want to win the pennant. Make them wonder if their chances wouldn't be better if they had you. If they wonder loud enough... I'll get you for them.
RICKEY=>Well?
SUKEFORTH=>I've never seen anything like it before. His fielding was only fair, as you know. He was new to first base. But, at bat!... For the seven- game series Jackie stole seven bases and hit .625!
RICKEY=>Pretty good. Pretty good.
JACKIE'S VOICE=>...Training is over, Rae. I've had no word yet. We fly to New York tomorrow to play exhibition games against Brooklyn on April 9th and 10th. The tenth is the last day before the official season begins so if I don't hear by then... I know I'm cooked. They say that some of the Dodgers didn't want me...
RICKEY=>It's a tough problem. Most of the players see his value, a few don't. That still leaves a Dodger team divided against itself. I don't want that.
HOPPER=>No... unless you could take a chance that they would all come around when they see that Jackie is helping them towards a common cause -- the pennant.
RICKEY=>I don't know... I don't know.
ANNOUNCER=>Well, here is Jackie Robinson up again in the last exhibition game before the start of the official National League season. Jackie has had two chances to show whether Rickey is wrong in not signing him for Brooklyn -- and failed to get a hit both times. Let's see what he does now with a man on first to bring in.
ANNOUNCER=>That wasn't so hot. An easy double play. It's hard to believe after the sensational reports of Jackie's playing in Cuba. Well, everybody has a bad day and I imagine he is feeling pretty blue now as he runs towards his dugout... No! He isn't sad at all... He's smiling. Wait a moment! Something's going on at the Montreal dugout. All his teammates are running out to greet him as they would a hero! What in...
PLAYERS=>You've made it, Jackie! The announcement just came out! You're a Dodger, boy!
RADIO ANNOUNCER=>...They've had to announce it to the crowd here, ladies and gentlemen. What we heard from Cuba was right. Jackie Robinson was good enough to be signed by Brooklyn. He's a Dodger -- finally!
HOPPER=>...and I mean it when I say I'm glad you're going with the Dodgers... ...Even though I'd like to keep you with the Royals...
JACKIE=>Mr. Hopper -- I really appreciate all the help you've given me... And I mean it, too, when I say that last year in Montreal was the happiest year I've ever had... Rae and I'd just as soon live there the rest of our lives...
RICKEY=>My congratulations, Jackie. The going is still going to be tough. But I can trust you now to take what comes and not lose your head until you win the National League players over like you did in the International League.
JACKIE=>You can trust me, Mr. Rickey. I can't afford to fail. My career is no longer a personal one, as you know...
RICKEY=>I know.
ANNOUNCER=>Today, ladies and gentleman, near the close of the 1949 baseball season, a great National League player, and outstanding American citizen, is on his way to Washington. His name is Jackie Robinson. He isn't going there to play ball. But he is going to talk about how an American patriot plays ball with the country that extends him the right to fight for freedom. He has been asked to discuss the patriotism of the American Negro... before the members of the Un-American Activities Committee.
JACKIE=>You can put me down as an expert on being a colored American, with thirty years of experience at it. And just like any other colored person with sense enough to look around him and understand what he sees, I know that life in these United States can be mighty tough for people who are a little different from the majority -- in their skin, color or the way they worship their God, or the way they spell their names. I'm not fooled because I've had a chance open to very few Negro Americans. It's true that I've been the laboratory specimen in a great change in organized baseball. I'm proud that I've made good on my assignment to the point where other colored players will find it easier to enter the game and go to the top. But I'm very well aware that even this limited job isn't finished. As I see it there has been a terrific lot of misunderstanding on this subject of communism among Negroes in this country, and it's bound to hurt my people's cause unless it's cleared up. I understand that there are some few Negroes who are members of the Communist party, and in event of war with Russia they would probably act just as any other Communists would. So would members of other minority and majority groups... Most Negroes -- and Italians and Irish and Jews and Swedes and Slavs and other Americans -- would act just as all these groups did in the last war. They'd do their best to help their country stay out of war; if unsuccessful, they'd do their best to help their country win the war -- against Russia or any other enemy that threatened us... I can't speak for any fifteen million people any more than any other one person can, but I know that I've got too much invested for my wife and child and myself in the future of this country, and I and other Americans of many races and faiths have too much invested in our country's welfare, for any of us to throw it away. I am a religious man. Therefore, I cherish America where I am free to worship as I please, a privilege which some countries do not give. And I suspect that 999 out of almost any 1,000 colored Americans you meet will tell you the same thing. But that doesn't mean that we're going to stop fighting race discrimination in this country until we've got it licked. It means that we're going to fight it all the harder because our stake in the future is so big. We can win our fight without the Communists and we don't want their help...
