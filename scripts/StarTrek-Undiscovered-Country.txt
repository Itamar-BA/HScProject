KIRK=>Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
ADMIRAL DONALD=>This briefing is classified. There will be no recording devices. Ladies and Gentlemen, the C-in-C.
SPOCK=>Good morning.
VFX OMITTED=>VFX
SPOCK=>Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis. We believe it was caused by over mining and insufficient safety precautions. The moon's decimation means an almost eighty percent loss of available energy and a deadly pollution of their ozone. Due to their large military expenditures, the Klingon economy is in a very weakened condition. They do not have sufficient resources to manufacture air shelters in large enough quantities to sustain anything like their current population. Last month - at the behest of the, uh, Vulcan Ambassador - I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
ADMIRAL DONALD=>Negotiations for what?
SPOCK=>The dismantling of our space stations and star bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to seventy years of unremitting hostility - a hostility the Klingons can no longer afford.
SPOCK=>If the Klingons sue for peace, we could accumulate savings in defense expenditures, leaving the Federation economy free to grapple with urgent social problems...
A MILITARY MAN=>Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
ADMIRAL DONALD=>I must protest. To offer the Klingons a safe haven within Federation space is suicide. Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy. And if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before a bellicose people with a foothold on our territory. The opportunity which presents itself here is to embargo trading, force them to run through their own resources faster, and bring them to their knees. Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
KIRK=>Sir -
KIRK=>Sir, I'm no diplomat, but the Klingons have never been trustworthy. I'm forced to agree with Admiral Donald. This is - - a terrible, a terrifying idea...
KIRK=>Yes, sir.
SPOCK=>It is imperative that we act NOW to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it would be better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
KIRK=>Me?
SPOCK=>We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
KIRK=>Why, in God's name?
SPOCK=>I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
KIRK=>You have personally -
KIRK=>Surely a full Ambassador would be better equipped to -
ADMIRAL DONALD=>I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
KIRK=>WE volunteered?
SPOCK=>There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
KIRK=>How could you vouch for me? That's... ... arrogant presumption -
SPOCK=>I was asked by my father to open neg-
KIRK=>I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
SPOCK=>Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
KIRK=>DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
SPOCK=>They're dying.
KIRK=>LET THEM DIE.
KIRK=>Has it occurred to you that this crew is due for retirement in three months? WE'VE DONE OUR BIT FOR KING AND COUNTRY.
KIRK=>You should have trusted me.

UHURA=>They're mothballing the fleet?
CHEKOV=>We will regret this...
LT. SAAVIK=>Captain on the bridge.
KIRK=>As you were. Lieutenant...?
LT. SAAVIK=>Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman - ... so I volunteered.
SPOCK=>Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you. The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
KIRK=>Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
LT. SAAVIK=>I don't believe so, sir.
BONES=>She's a Vulcan all right.
KIRK=>All right, let's get this over with... departure stations... Scotty?
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Aye, sir?
KIRK=>You find the engine room?
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Right where I left it, sir.
KIRK=>Standby. Get me the dock master, Uhura.

KIRK'S VOICE OVER=>Captain's log. Stardate 8679.225. They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks - and maybe they're right. It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
KIRK=>I have never trusted Klingons and never will. I have never been able to forgive them for the murder of my boy. Spock says this could be an historic moment and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
LT. SAAVIK=>Sorry -
KIRK=>Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
LT. SAAVIK=>We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
KIRK=>Right -
LT. SAAVIK=>Permission to speak freely, sir?
LT. SAAVIK=>I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
KIRK=>You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
LT. SAAVIK=>I always wanted to try that.
KIRK=>Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
SPOCK'S VOICE=>Enter.
SPOCK=>You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
LT. SAAVIK=>Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
SPOCK=>I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
VOICE FILTERED=>Klingon battlecruiser off the port bow. All hands on deck. Repeat...

KIRK=>Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
GORKON=>Thank you, Captain.
KIRK=>Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
GORKON=>We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
KIRK=>We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
GORKON=>I shall look forward to it.
KIRK=>I hope you're happy.
LT. SAAVIK=>Captain.
LT. SAAVIK=>- there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard - it might make the evening pass more... smoothly?

GORKON=>Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
GORKON=>Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur... my military advisor Brigadier Kerla... and this is General Chang my chief of staff.
CHANG=>I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
KIRK=>I'm not sure how to take that.
KERLA=>Sincere admiration, Kirk -
CHANG=>As one warrior to another...
KIRK=>Uh, right this way, gentlemen. I thought you might enjoy a brief tour...
2ND CREWMAN=>What about that smell? You know only the top of the line models can even talk.
LT. SAAVIK=>You men have work?
LT. SAAVIK=>Then snap to it.
GORKON=>Your research laboratory is most impressive...
KIRK=>Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
GORKON=>This cannot be easy for you, Captain... I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
KIRK=>Would you care to go topside?
CHANG=>Very much.
CHEKOV=>Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
KIRK=>Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
YOUNGER CREWMAN=>Would you want your daughter to marry one?

GORKON=>I give you a toast: the undiscovered country - the future.
SPOCK=>HAMLET, act three, scene one.
GORKON=>You have never experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
CHANG=>"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
KIRK=>I beg your pardon?
KERLA=>Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
KIRK=>One of the advantages of being a thousand light years from Federation headquarters.
BONES=>To you, Chancellor Gorkon: one of the architects of our future.
SCOTTY=>Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
AZETBUR=>Commander Spock, mindful of all your work behind the scenes, and despite the cordiality at this mess, I do not sense an acceptance of our people throughout your ship.
SPOCK=>They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
UHURA=>How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
CHEKOV=>Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
BONES=>And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
CHANG=>Captain Kirk, are you willing to give up Starfleet?
SPOCK=>I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
KIRK=>Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
CHANG=>Come now, Captain, this dinner is off the record: in space all warriors are cold warriors.
SCOTTY=>We have never tried to --
KERLA=>You hypocritically presume that
BONES=>That's not true...!
KERLA=>No?
UHURA=>General, are YOU fond of Shakespeare?
CHEKOV=>We do NOT impose democracy on others. We do believe that every planet has a sovereign claim to human rights.
AZETBUR=>"Human rights." Even the name is racist. The Federation is basically a "homo sapiens" only club...
CHANG=>Present company excepted, to be sure...
UHURA=>Well, I suppose we're not perfect -
SCOTTY=>Don't let them put words in your mouth - ! I haven't served 30 years in the engine room of a starship to be accused of gunboat diplomacy!
KERLA=>In any case, we know where this is leading: the annihilation of our culture. Klingons will replace those on the lowest rung of the Federation employment ladder, taking menial jobs and performing
CHEKOV=>That's economics, not racism -
UHURA=>But you have to admit it adds up to the same thing.
BONES=>Don't be naive, Commander -!
UHURA=>Who you calling naive -?
CHEKOV=>We're explorers not diplomats!
BONES=>Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
SCOTTY=>We follow orders...
CHEKOV=>Since when has THAT been an excuse? Diplomacy must resolve these -
SCOTTY=>Right - leave it to the politicians to muck it up and leave us defenseless...!
GORKON=>Well. I see we have a long way to go.
GORKON=>Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
GORKON=>You don't trust me.
GORKON=>I don't blame you. If there IS to be a Brave New World, we old people will have the hardest time living in it. Commander Spock.
SPOCK=>Chancellor. A pleasure to meet you, Ma'am.
AZETBUR=>Captain, Commander...

CHEKOV=>Did you see the way they ate? Terrible table manners.
SPOCK=>I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
KIRK=>I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
KIRK=>Captain's log. Stardate 8679.15. The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company for dinner last night. Our manners were not exactly Emily Post. Note to the galley: Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
KIRK=>But is wasn't the ale. That was just the excuse we needed to say all the things that were really on our minds...
SPOCK'S VOICE=>Captain Kirk, you are wanted on the bridge. Captain Kirk...

UHURA=>It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
KIRK=>I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
SPOCK=>I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
KIRK=>I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
SPOCK=>Perhaps you're right.
SPOCK=>Good luck, Captain.

UHURA=>They've been arrested.
CHEKOV=>Mr. Spock, we've got to do something!
SPOCK=>I assume command of this ship as of 0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
UHURA=>Yes, sir.
LT. SAAVIK=>But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
SPOCK=>What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
SCOTTY=>At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
SPOCK=>I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
LT. SAAVIK=>How did you - ?
SPOCK=>In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
SCOTTY=>NO WAY!
SPOCK=>Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
CHEKOV=>And if we can't piece together what happened? What then? Sir.
SPOCK=>Then Mr. Chekov, it resides in the hands of the diplomats.
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>The Chancellor of the High Council is dead - the result of an unprovoked attack while he traveled to see YOU under a flag of truce on a mission of peace. Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime. May I remind you that he and Doctor McCoy boarded KRONOS ONE of their own free will. None of these facts are in dispute, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT=>I will demand a full investigation. You can be assured we will cooperate with all our power to get to the bottom of the matter. In the meantime --
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law you claim to cherish. Kirk and Doctor McCoy WILL stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.

ADMIRAL DONALD=>The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT=>I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
PRESIDENT=>I do know it. And I'm afraid they're going to save it again. By standing trial.
PRESIDENT=>Do you know I agree with everything they said?
AMBASSADOR SAREK=>I'm sorry, Mr. President. And I know my son must feel equally responsible. It was at my request that he persuaded Kirk to undertake this mission.

AZETBUR=>Mr. President, let us come to the point: you want the conference to go forward and so did my father. I will attend in one week - after I've had the opportunity to master the details of this position - on one condition: we will not extradite the prisoners and you will not attempt to rescue them in a military operation. We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
PRESIDENT=>We look forward to meeting with you next week, Madam Chancellor. I hope you will be our guest here on --

KERLA=>Better to die on our feet than live on our knees...
AZETBUR=>That wasn't what my father wanted -
CHANG=>He was killed for what he wanted.
AZETBUR=>Kirk must have a fair trial.
CHANG=>Of course.
AZETBUR=>But I want a conviction. You will represent the State, General Chang.
CHANG=>With the greatest pleasure, Madam Chancellor.
SCOTTY=>It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
SPOCK=>Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
SCOTTY=>A computer canna lie, sir.
SPOCK=>I think not.
SCOTTY=>You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
SPOCK=>We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY=>That could take hours!
SPOCK=>Nevertheless.
SCOTTY=>And if they're still in place?
SPOCK=>Then someone forged a data bank entry.
LT. SAAVIK=>They've named Gorkon's daughter Chancellor - it was on the news.
SPOCK=>Her own father...?
LT. SAAVIK=>Such things have happened before, sir.
SCOTTY=>They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
SPOCK=>That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
SPOCK=>Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
LT. SAAVIK=>Not as yet, sir.
SPOCK=>Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
LT. SAAVIK=>Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.

VFX=>VOICE OVER.
KIRK=>What?
CHANG=>Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
KIRK=>The drink WAS served...
CHANG=>And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly
KIRK=>There... were no other ships in the sector.
CHANG=>Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
KIRK=>I checked the data banks, yes.
CHANG=>And what did they tell you?
KIRK=>That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
CHANG=>The witness is excused - for the time being.
GUARD=>After the first hit, we lost our gravitational field; I found myself weightless and unable to function. Then 2 Starfleet crewmen came walking toward us -
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>Perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms -
CHANG=>I move that remark be stricken as
JUDGE=>So ordered. Colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>If the gravitational field was not functioning, how could these men have been walking?
GUARD=>They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
SPOCK=>Gravity boots.
CHANG=>They fired on you?
GUARD=>With Starfleet issue phasers. They dashed into the Chancellor's stateroom, we could hear more phaser fire; then they went back the way they'd come.
CHANG=>Towards the transporter room?
GUARD=>That's right.
CHANG=>Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
BONES=>Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
BONES=>For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
CHANG=>Stand...?
BONES=>Retire.
CHANG=>Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>Objection!
JUDGE=>Sustained...
BONES=>We all did. But that doesn't mean -
JUDGE=>General Chang, come to the point or abandon this line of inquiry.
CHANG=>Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
BONES=>Barely.
CHANG=>Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
BONES=>I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
CHANG=>You say you are due for retirement.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>Objection!
JUDGE=>Overruled -
BONES=>I was nervous -
CHANG=>You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
BONES=>I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
CHANG=>The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
VFX=>VFX
CHANG=>And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
KIRK=>That isn't true...!
CHANG=>That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>Objection: Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
JUDGE=>Sustained.
CHANG=>I offer into the record the following excerpt from Captain Kirk's personal log.
KIRK'S VOICE=>I have never trusted Klingons and never will. I have never been able to forgive them for the murder of my boy...
CHANG=>Are those your words?
KIRK=>Yes.
CHANG=>Spoken by you?
KIRK=>Yes...
CHANG=>Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
KIRK=>Those words WERE spoken by me.
SULU=>Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER=>Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation - Aye, sir.
85A COURTROOM=>85A
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>Objection, your honors. My clients' political views are not on trial here.
UHURA=>Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
SPOCK=>He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
CHANG=>On the contrary, Captain Kirk's views and motives are at the heart of the matter. This officer's record shows the accused to be an insubordinate, unprincipled career opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command when it suited him.
CHANG=>Indeed the record will show that "Captain" Kirk was once "Admiral" Kirk and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations and the law. Do you deny you were demoted on these charges, Captain? DO NOT WAIT FOR THE TRANSLATION ANSWER ME NOW!
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>Don't answer - objection -!
JUDGE=>Objection overruled. The Prisoner will answer the question.
KIRK=>I cannot deny it.
CHANG=>You were demoted...
KIRK=>Yes.
CHANG=>For insubordination.
KIRK=>I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
CHANG=>And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>I object -!
KIRK=>I was unaware of the assassination until I boarded his ship!
CHANG=>You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
KIRK=>Well, I -
CHANG=>You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
KIRK=>I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
CHANG=>Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
KIRK=>I am.
CHANG=>So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
BONES=>Jim! They're setting us up! Your honors, I protest-!
JUDGE=>The defendant will be silent! Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
KIRK=>As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
CHANG=>Your honors, the State rests.
BONES=>Is it our turn, now?
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>According to Klingon law both sides present their cases at the same time; we've HAD our turn.
JUDGE=>It is the judgment of this court that the defendants are guilty as charged.
JUDGE=>Captain James T. Kirk, Doctor Leonard McCoy...
JUDGE=>Have either of you anything to say before this court passes sentence?
BONES=>We were framed.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY=>I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial. I beg the court to consider this when framing its sentence.
JUDGE=>So noted. In view of Colonel Worf's plea, the sentence of death is commuted. It is the judgment of this court that without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the Dilithium Mines on the penal asteroid archipelago of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
UHURA=>Rura Penthe!
CHEKOV=>Known throughout the galaxy as the Aliens' graveyard.
SCOTTY=>Better to kill them now and get it over with...
SPOCK=>Let's see it again, Lieutenant.
CHEKOV=>It is Enterprise. We fired.
SCOTTY=>It's na possible!! All weapons VISUALLY accounted for. Sir.
LT. SAAVIK=>Commander? This is most difficult to say, but has it occurred to... to any of us... that the Captain is... that is, we know his feelings about Klingons, what they did to his...
LT. SAAVIK=>Well, it IS possible.
SPOCK=>Again.
SPOCK=>Hold.
SPOCK=>An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
UHURA=>What exactly does that mean?
SPOCK=>It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
SCOTTY=>They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
SPOCK=>There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
SCOTTY=>Not from us!
CHEKOV=>A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship...
UHURA=>KRONOS One?
SPOCK=>Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
SCOTTY=>If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
SPOCK=>Would they?
LT. SAAVIK=>A Bird of Prey!
CKEKOV=>Cloaked!?
SCOTTY=>A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
SPOCK=>This one can.
SCOTTY=>They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
SPOCK=>I believe I am.
LT. SAAVIK=>We must inform Starfleet Command -
SCOTTY=>Inform them of what? A new weapon that isn't visible? Raving lunatics - that's what they'll call us! They'll say we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain we'll say anything -
SPOCK=>And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
UHURA=>Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
SPOCK=>I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
LT. SAAVIK=>Aye, sir -
CHEKOV=>I do not understand. If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
SPOCK=>You're forgetting something. the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
CHEKOV=>What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
SPOCK=>You tell them, Lieutenant.
LT. SAAVIK=>Two pairs of gravity boots.
COMMANDANT=>This is Rura Penthe. Observe: there is no stockade, no guard tower, no electrified frontier. They are not needed. Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming. Your new home is underground.
PRISONER=>NO! NOOOOO!
COMMANDANT=>Punishment means EXILE from prison to the surface - on the surface nothing can survive.
COMMANDANT=>Below no one can escape. Work well and you will be treated well. Work badly and you will die.

KIRK=>He's got it.
MARTIA=>And your coat.
KIRK=>Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
MARTIA=>Fendo pompsky.
KIRK=>Thanks...
BONES=>What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
MARTIA=>Prisoners from outside the Klingon system. They tend to band together. I'm Martia.
MARTIA=>This'll help keep you warm. You're Kirk and McCoy.
KIRK=>How did you know...?
MARTIA=>There's a reward for your death.
BONES=>Figures.
KIRK=>We've been set up all along.
MARTIA=>We don't get many presidential assassins.
KIRK=>We didn't kill Gorkon.
MARTIA=>Of course not. Anyway, somebody up
BONES=>I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
MARTIA=>They'll make it look like an accident...
BONES=>What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
MARTIA=>I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
KIRK=>How much time's left of your sentence?
MARTIA=>Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
SPOCK=>Any progress?
LT. SAAVIK=>We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
SPOCK=>Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
CHEKOV=>Why not simply vaporize them?
LT. SAAVIK=>Like this?
LT. SAAVIK=>As you know, sir, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
LT. SAAVIK=>Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
SPOCK=>I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
UHURA=>Did someone shoot off a phaser? Mr. Spock.
UHURA=>I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
SPOCK=>Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
SCOTTY=>There's nothing wrong with the bloody -
SCOTTY=>- could take weeks, sir.
SPOCK=>Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
LT. SAAVIK=>A lie?
SPOCK=>An error.
UHURA=>I'll tell them someone threw a gravity boot into it...
LT. SAAVIK=>Right, a gravity boot in the warp drive...
UHURA=>You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
SPOCK=>At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
MARTIA=>They'll respect him now...
BONES=>That's a comfort...
KIRK=>I was lucky that thing had knees.
MARTIA=>That's not his knee. Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
KIRK=>Anything else you want to tell me?
KIRK=>Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
BONES=>Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
MARTIA=>When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
KIRK=>There's gotta be a way out of this place...
SULU=>Come in...?
OFFICER=>Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
SULU=>What?
OFFICER=>Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
SULU=>Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
OFFICER=>Sir?
SULU=>You having hearing problems,
OFFICER=>No, sir.
BONES=>Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
KIRK=>We're not finished.
BONES=>Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
BONES=>- Kobayashi Maru...
KIRK=>Bones, are you afraid of the future?
BONES=>That was the general idea I intended to convey.
KIRK=>I didn't mean this future.
BONES=>Are we playing multiple choice?
KIRK=>Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen; I was frightened, really frightened.
BONES=>Specifically of...?
BONES=>Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
KIRK=>Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
BONES=>Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
MARTIA=>Kirk? It's me, Martia.
MARTIA=>Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
KIRK=>Except us.
MARTIA=>It IS possible.
MARTIA=>I know how to get outside the shield.
KIRK=>Where do we come in?
MARTIA=>Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us
KIRK=>Possibly.
MARTIA=>I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
KIRK=>Candidate for what?
MARTIA=>A partnership. Go to "C" Lift in the morning for mining duty. I'll meet you there.
BONES=>What is it with you, anyway?
KIRK=>Still think we're finished?
BONES=>More than ever.
SPOCK=>Klingon blood.
CHEKOV=>They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
SPOCK=>This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
CHEKOV=>Now we go to Starfleet?
SPOCK=>Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
CHEKOV=>ALL uniforms?
CHEKOV=>Aye, sir... ALL uniforms...
CHEKOV=>Mister Chekov.
SPOCK=>The longer we take, the greater danger in which we leave the Captain and Doctor McCoy.
THRU=>105 OBSERVATION DECK, INSTRUMENTS PANELS, etc... you name it... piles and piles of CLOTHING being sorted by the CREW; piles of BOOTS being examined as Lieutenant Saavik prowls the CORRIDORS and checks off locations on a LIGHTPLAN of the ship...
SPOCK=>You are Crewman Dax?
DAX=>Yes, sir. What's happened?
CHEKOV=>Perhaps you know the Romulan epic of Cinderella? If the shoe fits, wear it!

SECOND KLINGON GENERAL=>It does not matter. Kirk cannot know the location.
CHANG=>Are you sure? Are you willing to take that chance?
SECOND KLINGON GENERAL=>Helmsman, new course! Engage cloaking device.
SPOCK=>The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
KIRK=>So, that's it..
SCOTTY=>Captain - ! Mr. Spock, I've found the missing uniforms with Klingon blood on them! They belong to -

LT. SAAVIK=>You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
BONES=>What do you think YOU'VE been doing?
LT. SAAVIK=>Saving Starfleet. Klingons can't be trusted, sir, you said so yourself. They killed your son. They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor. You'd make peace with them?
KIRK=>Who is "US?"
LT. SAAVIK=>I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon

SPOCK=>Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's
UHURA=>We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
LT. SAAVIK=>I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
CHEKOV=>Where IS the conference?
KIRK=>She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
LT. SAAVIK=>And no way you'll find out.
SCOTTY=>Then we're dead.
SPOCK=>I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.

SPOCK=>The Commander is an old friend of yours.

SULU=>This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
KIRK=>Sulu!
SULU=>Standing by, Captain Kirk.
KIRK=>You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
SULU=>I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
KIRK=>Bless you, Sulu. Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
SULU=>The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
KIRK=>I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
SULU=>Surely not.
KIRK=>I'm telling you. Hang on. How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
LT. SAAVIK=>Just the prototype.
KIRK=>You hear that?
SULU=>I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
KIRK=>When does this conference start?
SULU=>According to my information, today.
KIRK=>Thank you, Captain Sulu.
SULU=>Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.

KIRK=>The night is young. Anyway, it was logical. You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
KIRK=>I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
SPOCK=>I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
KIRK=>You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
SPOCK=>I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
KIRK=>Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
SPOCK=>Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived
KIRK=>Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
SPOCK=>I SHOULD have been -
KIRK=>Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
SPOCK=>But I am not human. I am only -
KIRK=>Spock, you want to know something?
KIRK=>Everyone's human. We're too old to play games. We're only human.
CHEKOV=>Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
BONES=>Now there's a poser.

UFP PRESIDENT=>We believe that the responsibility for destiny rests squarely on our own shoulders...
KIRK=>She's here - somewhere.
CHEKOV=>But if she's cloaked...
KIRK=>Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
SPOCK=>Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.

There were those who said he was an idealist, driven by visionary notions; others said he had no choice, that he was a pragmatic technocrat, making the best of a devastating situation. Great men are seldom good men. The truth is my father was both: a pragmatist and an idealist. If Praxis hadn't exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression. Nor would mine. We are a proud race. We are here because we want to go on being proud... if we cannot make war, we will make peace...
KIRK=>Ahead full impulse!
VFX=>VFX
CHANG=>After her... poor thing. Doesn't know which way to go.
VFX=>VFX
UHURA=>Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
KIRK=>Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
BONES=>Too bad we can't SMELL her.
CHEKOV=>In space, no one can hear you sweat.
KIRK=>It's a pity Starships were never equipped with bloodhounds...
SPOCK=>I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
UHURA=>Maybe we should write them a letter?
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Better post date it.
SPOCK=>Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
UHURA=>Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
BONES=>I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
SPOCK=>You may need assistance, doctor...
BONES=>Fascinating...
KIRK=>Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
CHEKOV=>Aye, sir; thrusters...
VFX=>VFX
BONES=>Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
SPOCK=>Vulcans sleep lying down...
BONES=>Spock, that was actually funny.
SPOCK=>We DO sleep lying down.
SCOTTY=>Captain, she's packing quite a wallop. Shields weakening.
VFX=>VFX
SULU=>Shields up. Tell them the Cavalry's here.
175A VFX=>VFX
CHANG=>So.
VFX=>VFX
KIRK=>Hold us steady, Mr. Scott. Ready to fire... Bones...!
KIRK'S VOICE OVER=>Bones, where's my torpedo?
BONES=>Me and my big mouth...
SPOCK=>Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
BONES=>Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
BONES=>Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
SPOCK=>We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
SCOTTY=>Shields collapsing...!
VFX=>VFX
VFX OMITTED=>VFX
KIRK=>Fire!
VFX=>VFX
CHANG=>... "or NOT to be..."
VFX=>VFX
SULU=>Aim for the center of that explosion and FIRE!
VFX=>VFX
KIRK=>Mr. President!
ADMIRAL DONALD=>Arrest those men!
SPOCK=>Arrest yourself.
VFX=>VFX
SULU=>Just a minute.
KERLA=>And you.
PRESIDENT AZETBUR=>What's the meaning of this?
KIRK=>It's about the future, Madam Chancellor. Some people think the future means the end of history.
KIRK=>But we haven't run out of history just yet.
SPOCK=>I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
KIRK=>Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
KIRK=>There's an old expression: it takes one to know one.
AZETBUR=>You've restored my father's faith.
KIRK=>You've restored my son's.
VFX=>VFX
UHURA=>They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
SPOCK=>But you didn't join a conspiracy.
BONES=>They don't arrest people for having
CHEKOV=>If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
KIRK=>The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
SPOCK=>... is to trust him.
SULU'S VOICE=>Captain Kirk...?
KIRK=>Kirk here.
VFX=>VFX
KIRK=>As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks, Captain Sulu.
SULU=>Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk. Take care.
VFX=>VFX
VFX OMITTED=>VFX
BONES=>By God, that's a big ship.
SCOTTY=>Not so big as her Captain, I think.
KIRK=>Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen. Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
BONES=>And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
KIRK=>To be -
SPOCK=>Or not to be -
BONES=>That's the question -
CHEKOV=>Course heading, Captain?
KIRK=>Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
VFXA=>VFXA
KIRK'S VOICE OVER=>Captain's log, U.S.S. Enterprise, Stardate 8769.24. This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command. This ship and her history will shortly become the care of a new generation. To them and their posterity will we commit our future. They will continue the voyages we have begun and journey to ALL the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man... where no ONE has gone before.
VFX=>starfield. Then Leonard Nimoy, then DeForest
