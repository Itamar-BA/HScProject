REAL-ESTATE LADY=>-- and it's been done up so beautifully, you're lucky to be the first people to look at it. It's my personal favorite of all of our homes.
WOMAN'S VOICE=>-- then there's the kitchen, which has been entirely remodelled.
SECOND REAL-ESTATE LADY=>That's strange. I what could be wrong here.
REAL-ESTATE MAN=>-- in all new houses there are certain kinks to be ironed out.
JULIE=>It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>Not very long. There have been a couple of bids already.
JULIE=>Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first. It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
JULIE=>Just reduced.
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
JULIE=>This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>Isn't it?
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
JULIE=>Oh, space! -- You said the right thing.
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>How large is your brood?
JULIE=>Two -- three if you count the husband.
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>We must always count the husband. By my count there've been... four. But I still live in hope.
JULIE=>Well, Phil wasn't sure he wanted us to be this far outside the city. But we have friends around here and something told me I should take a look at this house. I want to be somewhere surrounded by green.
JULIE=>... I just had a feeling.
THERAPIST=>How's the new place?
HIDER=>It's great. It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers. There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
THERAPIST=>And the rent is okay?
HIDER=>Oh, it's nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
THERAPIST=>All right then. That's important, isn't it? -- For you to be in an "up" environment. I'm saying you should literally take that as your base, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
HIDER=>Right.
THERAPIST=>And what about work? Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
HIDER=>Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff. I still find it very soothing.
THERAPIST=>I'm happy that you're working again. As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
HIDER=>Yeah, since I was a kid. I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time. Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
THERAPIST=>-- hospital.
HIDER=>-- institution.
THERAPIST=>Right. So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
HIDER=>Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
THERAPIST=>Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
PHIL=>Neil, calm down.
JULIE=>Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
PHIL=>We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>Yes -- they're quite inexpensive and easy to install.
PHIL=>Do you mind if we --
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>Please -- take as much time as you want.
PHIL=>Julie, I just don't think we can afford this house.
HIDER=>... "Julie"...
JULIE=>I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
PHIL=>What?
JULIE=>You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
PHIL=>What's that?
JULIE=>This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
PHIL=>Stop knowing me so well.
JULIE=>I know it's at the high end of our range --
PHIL=>High end? Honey, it's a whole new budget.
JULIE=>But it's what we want.
PHIL=>You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
JULIE=>They don't expect to get what they're asking. Let's make an offer.
PHIL=>You want me to bargain at the high end of our range? -- I'll have a stroke. I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
JULIE=>You could have a pool to cool off in.
PHIL=>It's a nice pool, isn't it?
JULIE=>And it's a shorter commute.
PHIL=>It'll be even shorter if I get that new job. Come on.
JULIE=>Let's do it. Take a breath and -- and if we're over our heads, well, we'll sell it. Philip, this is our house. You know it is. It's our house.
PHIL=>All right, but look, we can't say anything to this shark lady now, okay? We have to play it real cool.
JULIE=>What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
PHIL=>Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer. But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>So you've seen a lot of houses then?
NEIL=>Yeah, a bunch, but my mom really likes this one. She was all excited when she saw it and got my dad all excited when she told him about it. He's sick of looking already.
NEIL=>Are we gonna buy this house?
PHIL=>Do you have enough money?
JULIE=>We're going to think about it.
PHIL=>It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>Well, Mr. Dreyer, I don't have to tell you what an important investment a house is.
PHIL=>Actually, I never recommend property to my clients as merely a good investment. There are bonds that can serve just as well. A house for me is a place I want to live and raise my family in.
HOLLY=>Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
HOLLY=>I found a cent!
JULIE=>"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
HOLLY=>Look at my coin!
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>Must be a good omen, sugar.
JULIE=>Must be.
NEIL=>Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
PHIL=>Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
REAL-ESTATE LADY=>By all means, let's Rudolf's opinion.
PHIL=>Rudolf, get down here!
HOLLY=>Oh, gross!
NEIL=>It's okay -- Rudolf likes the house!
PHIL=>Hey, c'mon now, get him out of there! -- This isn't our house yet.
PHIL=>How were we -- were we cool?
JULIE=>Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
PHIL=>Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
ANSWER SERVICE=>Dial Answer Service?
HIDER=>Hi, this is Tom Sykes.
ANSWER SERVICE=>Mr. Sykes? Let me see... there were two calls for you today. One from Dr. Levine at three o'clock -- he'd like to reschedule next week's appointment, if possible. And the dry cleaners called and said your jacket is ready.
HIDER=>Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. I've been real busy. I just got a new phone installed, so I thought I'd test it. Okay, Claire, thanks a lot, talk to you again.
ANSWER SERVICE=>Goodbye, Mr. Sykes.
PHIL=>Come on, honey -- let's go play in the new house.
SECRETARY=>Ooh, I like.
PHIL=>And this -- is the master bedroom.
SECRETARY=>Oh yeah? Where's the bed?
PHIL=>Right over here.
SECRETARY=>Is it a king or a queen?
PHIL=>It's a double.
SECRETARY=>Even better.
PHIL=>Even cosier.
SECRETARY=>That's right -- you got the bill this morning. I put it on your desk.
PHIL=>Thank you -- how efficient of you.
PHIL=>When we move in, everyone's going to have to learn to work this complicated security system.
PHIL=>Okay! We have TV! We can all get stupid again!
NEIL=>What about cable?
PHIL=>We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
NEIL=>No.
JULIE=>Gimme a break, Neil -- your father just spent three hours connecting the VCR.
PHIL=>All right, that's enough for one day -- I want everyone up at the crack of dawn. We have the whole weekend to get this place in shape.
JULIE=>'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
HOLLY=>'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
SALESGIRL=>Are you being helped, sir?
HIDER=>I'm looking for some perfume.
SALESGIRL=>Any particular brand?
HIDER=>Well, it's for a woman.
SALESGIRL=>Wife, girlfriend or mother?
HIDER=>Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
JULIE=>C'mon, kids, let's go.
NEIL=>"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
PHIL=>All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
NEIL=>I didn't.
JULIE=>Now, Neil. Stop teasing your sister.
PHIL=>Damn.
PHIL=>Hey -- uh, excuse me.
PHIL=>I didn't kick this onto your property.
PHIL=>Phil Dreyer -- we just moved in over here.
NASTY NEIGHBOR=>I see you have kids -- and a dog.
PHIL=>That's right.
NASTY NEIGHBOR=>Just keep 'em quiet and away from my property.
PHIL=>Did you hear that?
JULIE=>What?
PHIL=>Did you hear what he said?
JULIE=>What?
PHIL=>He made, you know, a remark.
JULIE=>Honey, are you okay?
PHIL=>-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is? Some nice neighborhood.
JULIE=>Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine. Don't get in an uproar.
PHIL=>I know. It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
JULIE=>It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
NEIL AND HOLLY=>MOM!
JULIE=>Kill 'em.
JULIE=>Good luck, kid,
JULIE=>Hey. Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
HOLLY=>Bye, Neil!
BULLY=>"Bye, Mom -- Bye, Mommy."
BULLY=>So, Neil. How's it goin'?
NEIL=>Okay.
BULLY=>I'm Bernard, by the way. Those are cool Reeboks, Neil. They're real new, aren't they?
NEIL=>Hey, c'mon.
BULLY=>They're really white.
NEIL=>Hey, c'mon, you guys, lay off.
BULLY=>We gotta break 'em in for you. You don't wanna go 'round lookin' like a new dil-wad, do ya?
FRIENDLY BOY=>You met Bernard. Nice guy, huh?
HIDER=>Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
THERAPIST=>Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you hope the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
HIDER=>When I was a child... I got used to the closets. The boxes. The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip. I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood. Cardboard. I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard. That smelled like rust and decay. It was safe in the boxes. It was when they took me out --
THERAPIST=>In the institution... when you were violent... did you want them to put you in solitary confinement?
HIDER=>I guess so. I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone. I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
THERAPIST=>You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone. In other words, you've done your best. I'm saying don't carry the burden of other people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
THERAPIST=>Are you still afraid of your parents? Of them finding you?
HIDER=>That was years and years ago. They must be very old now, if they're still alive.
HIDER=>No, my parents don't worry me anymore. I mean, that's why I was ultimately released, wasn't it? I mean, even with the state closing down the hospital and all. Because I'm able to be on my own at last. I'm cured.
NEIL=>Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
JULIE=>Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
NEIL=>I could take a cab on the way home.
JULIE=>Here, take this out to the table.
NEIL=>But there's this psycho. Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with every day. I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
JULIE=>How was lunch?
PHIL=>Huh?
JULIE=>How was your lunch with Charlie?
PHIL=>Oh -- great.
JULIE=>Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
PHIL=>No. If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
PHIL=>Whose is this? Who left this here?
CHARLIE=>-- A little something for the new house.
JULIE=>Oh, thank you, Charlie.
NEIL=>God, your sister's really hot.
JULIE=>Well, the neighbors are a little weird -- other than that...
NICE MAN=>Thanks a lot.
PHIL=>Present company excepted -- it's the neighbors out there to the right who are a bit strange.
JULIE=>Yeah, I caught him looking at me the other day.
NICE WOMAN=>In all the years we've lived here, I don't think we've spoken a word to them, have we, hon?
NICE MAN=>Sometimes when I go to the hospital early in the morning, I've seen him coming home. Maybe he works at night.
NICE WOMAN=>You'll probably see the wife once in a while at the supermarket. Truly one of the walking dead.
CHARLIE=>Sounds like your normal upper- middle-class neighborhood to me.
NEIL=>Let's follow 'em.
NEIL=>It's fun.
RITA=>You've done a really great job with the house. It's great!
JULIE=>Yeah. There's still a lot I want to do. It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here. Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
RITA=>So you don't have anything concrete?
JULIE=>No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
RITA=>Have you just plain asked him?
JULIE=>I've asked him what's wrong.
RITA=>And?
JULIE=>The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything. He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
RITA=>I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
JULIE=>I've tried to get him to agree to one. I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
RITA=>Don't drive yourself crazy. It's probably nothing.
RITA=>Hi, Neil.
NEIL=>Hi. We're going to the mall.
JULIE=>Rita, he's only twelve years old,
RITA=>He'll never appreciate it more.
NICE WOMAN=>... No, not really. We do hear of break-ins now and again, but it's generally a real low-crime area. We've never had any trouble.
JULIE=>Is there any kind of Neighborhood Watch or --
NICE MAN=>You're talking to her.
JULIE=>Do you remember who gave us this?
PHIL=>No.
JULIE=>There's no card or anything.
JULIE=>I hear things in this house,
PHIL=>All new houses have noises.
JULIE=>How long does it have to be a new house?
PHIL=>One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
JULIE=>Neil's still having a bad time at school. I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
PHIL=>He's made some friends, hasn't he?
PHIL=>I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
JULIE=>I know someone else who's sensitive.
PHIL=>Honey, I have a lot of meetings in the morning.
PHIL=>You never know when, do you.
JULIE=>Baby, what is it?
HOLLY=>I'm thirsty.
JULIE=>Aw, okay.
JULIE=>It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
HOLLY=>A man scared me.
JULIE=>A man? Was it a dream?
HOLLY=>Uh huh.
NEIL=>Has anyone seen Rudolf? I don't think he came in last night.
JULIE=>No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
NEIL=>RUDOLF!
PHIL=>Neil, do you mind?
NEIL=>Rudolf? C'mere, Rudolf!
NEIL=>Rudolf!
PHIL=>Don't cry, honey, Rudolf knows how to take care of himself. I'm sure he's okay. Maybe he just went on a trip.
HOLLY=>Like our vacation? Are we still going?
PHIL=>Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while. Maybe Rudolf got the same idea. Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
JULIE=>Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
NEIL=>I hate it here! I hate it!
WAITRESS=>You didn't finish your greens, but I'll let you have some dessert.
HIDER=>No, thank you.
WAITRESS=>Come on, you know you want some.
HIDER=>No, not tonight, I have to be getting on home.
NEIL=>All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
PHIL=>Why? I just read your report card. What's the point? Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered. What kind of report card do you call this?!
NEIL=>I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
PHIL=>Oh really? You've been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
PHIL=>If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
NEIL=>I have a cold.
PHIL=>What did the thermometer say?
NEIL=>The thermometer's broken.
JULIE=>He doesn't have a temperature.
NEIL=>I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week
