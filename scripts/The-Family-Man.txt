KATE=>That was not officially the goodbye kiss. It was just an interim kiss...
JACK=>Tonight.
LASSITER=>I need you, tiger..
CASH=>You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
VOICE=>I feel like I really did win the lottery!
CASH=>Look, I don’t know what you’re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
JACK=>How much time?!
ARNIE=>Trouble at work?
ARNIE=>Four bedrooms, two and a half baths, and a partially finished basement...
ARNIE=>God, it feels so good to finally give something back to you...

JACK=>This is just...
BILL KRAMER=>So tomorrow’s the big day, Jackie...
JACK=>...but obviously not up to your high standards...
JACK=>Look, just send us what you sent us last month, okay...? And keep doing that until further notice...
JACK=>So like I said, I don’t have any idea why you should buy your parts from us...
JACK=>You want to bid hearts, we’re right there with you. You feel the need to redouble, you’re not going to get any argument from us...
KATE=>Thanks, Jack...
KATE=>You look amazing in that
KATE=>Worse, you mean...
KATE=>Have a good day...
ALAN=>I’m sure you do...
KATE=>I promise, Jack...
ADELLE=>Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
JACK=>...I sing to you...not all the time but definitely on special occasions...
JACK=>...and it made me a better person to be around you...
