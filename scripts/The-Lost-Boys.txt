GUARD=>I told you to stay off the boardwalk.
DAVID=>Come on, let's pull.
GUARD=>You too, off the boardwalk. And don't come back!
LUCY=>We're getting close...
SAM=>What's that smell?
LUCY=>Ocean air!
SAM=>Smells like something died.
LUCY=>Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move... but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
LUCY=>How 'bout some music.
SAM=>Keep going.
MICHAEL=>Keep going.
SAM/MICHAEL=>Keep going.
LUCY=>Wait. Haight-Ashbury! The summer of love! 'Mellow Yellow.'
SAM/MICHAEL=>Keep going!
SAM=>Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
LUCY=>That's the boardwalk, Sam.
SAM=>Can we go now, huh?
LUCY=>Maybe later. Grandpa's expecting us.
MICHAEL=>I need to stretch my legs. I'll follow you.
LUCY=>Tell them to get something to eat.
SAM=>I thought we were poor.
LUCY=>Not that poor.
LUCY=>Still mad at me?
MICHAEL=>For what.
LUCY=>For everything.
LUCY=>If you want to check it out and meet us later it's okay.
SAM=>What!? He can and I can't?! No fair!!
MICHAEL=>That's okay, Mom. I can see it later. I'll help you unload.
RUNAWAY=>Hey, thanks, lady.
LUCY=>Use some of it to call home. Those kids look like me twenty years ago.
SAM=>When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
LUCY=>You've heard this story before?
SAM=>So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
MICHAEL=>He looks dead.
LUCY=>He's just a deep sleeper.
MICHAEL=>He's not breathing, Mom.
SAM=>If he's dead can we move back to Phoenix?
GRANDPA=>Playin' dead... and from what I heard, doin; a damn good job of it, too.
MICHAEL=>This is kind of a cool place.
SAM=>I'm so excited I just can't hide it. I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
MICHAEL=>Will you give Mom a break?
SAM=>Grandpa does not own a T.V. Have you noticed? There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV. I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
MICHAEL=>Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
SAM=>Even poor people have T.V.s
GRANDPA=>Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
LUCY=>A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation. We've all been through enough. Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
GRANDPA=>Ouch, my hair...
LUCY=>When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
MICHAEL=>This room is mine.
SAM=>I was here first.
MICHAEL=>Okay. I'll flip you for it.
SAM=>Okay...
MICHAEL=>Owwww! You little shit!
SAM=>Help me, Mom. Help.
LUCY=>Soon.
GRANDPA=>Rules!
GRANDPA=>Got some rules around here.
GRANDPA=>Second shelf is mine... keep my root beers and double-thick Mint Oreo cookies there... Nobody touches the second shelf...
GRANDPA=>When the mailman brings the T.V. Guide on Wednesdays, sometimes the corner of the address label will curl up... You'll be tempted to peel it off. Don't. You'll end up rippin' the cover and I don't like that...
GRANDPA=>... And stay outta here.
SAM=>You have a T.V.?
GRANDPA=>No, I just like to read the T.V. Guide. Read the T.V. Guide, you don't need a T.V...
LUCY=>This is how we used to do it. 'Pony Time.'
MICHAEL=>You're beautiful.
SAM=>Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
LUCY=>I think I dated that guy.
LUCY=>This boy seems to be lost.
LUCY=>I thought maybe his parents might be in here?
MOTHER=>Terry... Oh, thank God... I was so worried...
LUCY=>No, thanks.
MAX=>I told you not to come in here anymore.
MAX=>Wild kids.
LUCY=>Oh, they're just young. We were that age, too, once. Only they dress better.
MAX=>You've got a generous nature. I like that in a person. My name is Max.
LUCY=>Lucy.
MAX=>So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy? We've got it all. Best
LUCY=>I'm not looking for a tape. What I need is --
MAX=>-- a job.
LUCY=>Do I look that needy?
SAM=>Where are we going?
MICHAEL=>Nowhere.
SAM=>Then what's the rush? You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it? I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
MICHAEL=>Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
SAM=>As a matter of fact, I do.
SAM=>You can't put the Superman D.C. #3400 series with the #500's... it's a different artist.
ALAN=>He's right.
SAM=>And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
EDGAR=>Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
SAM=>Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
ALAN=>Just passing through Santa Carla?
SAM=>No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
EDGAR=>If you're gonna live around here, then here's one you don't wanna be without.
SAM=>I don't like horror comics.
ALAN=>This one could save your life.
STAR=>Are you following me?
MICHAEL=>Well, I...
STAR=>Did you want to talk to me?
MICHAEL=>Well... yeah. Sure.
STAR=>Okay. Talk.
MICHAEL=>I just wanted to... I, uh...
SAM=>Mom's here.
SAM=>Let's go.
STAR=>Nice talking to you.
MICHAEL=>It's early. Why do we have to go home?
LUCY=>Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
MICHAEL=>I'll hitch.
LUCY=>Oh, no, you won't.
SAM=>Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
MICHAEL=>Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
SAM=>He met a girl.
LUCY=>I guess no one cares what I got a job.
SAM=>Can we get a T.V.?
SAM=>Do I have to do this?
MICHAEL=>Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
GREG=>My beach, my wave, dude.
MARIA=>I'd be out on the street if it wasn't for Max. Nobody would'a given me a job the way I looked when I walked in here.
LUCY=>I haven't seen him all day.
MARIA=>He only comes in nights. He's busy opening another store in Los Gatos. Much bigger than this one.
MICHAEL=>See you later.
LUCY=>I get off in another twenty minutes. I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
MICHAEL=>I'll pass.
STAR=>It's a rip-off.
MICHAEL=>Hi...
STAR=>If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
MICHAEL=>What's your name?
STAR=>Star.
MICHAEL=>Oh. Your folks, too, huh?
STAR=>What do you mean?
MICHAEL=>Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something. But Star's great. I like Star.
STAR=>Me, too.
MICHAEL=>I'm Michael.
STAR=>Michael's great. I like Michael.
STAR=>I guess you're new around here.
MICHAEL=>Sort of. We used to come here
MICHAEL=>Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat?
STAR=>Okay.
DAVID=>Where you going?
STAR=>For a ride.
DAVID=>With him?
STAR=>Yeah.
DAVID=>I'm David. Paul... Dwayne... Marko.
LADDIE=>Hi... I'm Laddie.
STAR=>This is Michael.
MICHAEL=>We still going?
DAVID=>Honda 250, huh?
MICHAEL=>That's right.
DAVID=>C'mon, Star. Climb on.
MICHAEL=>Star?...
DAVID=>Know where Hudson's Bluff is? Overlooking the point?
MICHAEL=>I can't beat a Triumph.
DAVID=>You don't have to beat me, Michael. Just try to keep up.
DAVID=>(shouting above the noise of the WIND
DAVID=>How far you willing to go, Michael?
DAVID=>This was the hottest resort in Santa Carla back about eighty years ago. Too bad they built it right on top of the San Adreas fault. In 1906, when the big one hit San Francisco, the ground opened up and this place took a header into the crack.
PAUL=>Man, you wouldn't believe the cool stuff we've found in here.
STAR=>C'mon, Michael. I want to go.
DAVID=>No. Stick around.
MICHAEL=>We were gonna grab some food.
DAVID=>Good idea. Marko. We're hungry.
DAVID=>See? All you gotta do is ask. How about an appetizer?
LUCY=>Ten o'clock. Lights out.
SAM=>Mom.
LUCY=>I can't sleep with the closet door open, either. Not even a crack. Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared. I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the closet monster!
GRANDPA=>Closet monster!?
LUCY=>Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!
GRANDPA=>It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
GRANDPA=>Brought you a little somethin' to dress up your room with, Sam.
SAM=>Thanks, Grandpa...
GRANDPA=>Lots more where he came from.
LUCY=>Lights out, Sam.
SAM=>Soon as I finish this comic. Okay?
MICHAEL=>Where are you guys from?
PAUL=>We're from right here.
MICHAEL=>I mean, where do you live?
DWAYNE=>Right here.
MICHAEL=>You live here? Your folks let you?
PAUL=>Is he talking parents?
DWAYNE=>What are they?
DAVID=>We do what we want, Michael. We have complete freedom. Nobody knows about this place... and nobody knows about us.
DAVID=>Freedom, Michael. No parents. No rules. Hell, we're as free as birds.
MARKO=>Chow time!
DAVID=>Chinese! Good choice.
DAVID=>Guests first.
DAVID=>It's only rice. Don't you like rice? 300 million Chinese people can't be wrong.
DAVID=>So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
MICHAEL=>What?...
DAVID=>You're eating maggots. How do they taste?
STAR=>Leave him alone.
DAVID=>Sorry, Michael. No hard feelings, huh? Here. Try these noodles.
MICHAEL=>Worms!
DAVID=>Worms?...
MICHAEL=>Don't! Stop!
DAVID=>Why? They're only noodles.
STAR=>That's enough!
STAR=>Don't Michael. You don't have to. It's blood!
MICHAEL=>Good joke, blood.
SAM=>Michael, come on. It's one o'clock already.
MICHAEL=>Go away.
SAM=>You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy
MICHAEL=>Entertain yourself.
SAM=>Nanook... this is my life: I come from a broken home. My mother works all day. My brother sleeps all day. And my Grandpa, who is possibly and alien, stuffs chipmonks.
GRANDPA=>Whatcha doin'?
SAM=>Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
GRANDPA=>Gotta keep in practice. It's a dyin' art.
SAM=>Good!
GRANDPA=>Whatcha doin' over here?
SAM=>Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck. What's all that
GRANDPA=>Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days. Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years. Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
SAM=>Great. I wanna get some new comics.
GRANDPA=>Get in.
GRANDPA=>Got to let her warm up a bit. Hear that, Sam? Just like a baby pussycat. OKay?! Let's go to town!
GRANDPA=>Are we havin' fun or what?
SAM=>I thought we were goin' into town.
GRANDPA=>I hate goin' into town. That's about as close to town as I like to get.
SAM=>What did you do last night? You look wasted.
MICHAEL=>I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
SAM=>You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
MICHAEL=>What would that make Mom?
SAM=>You're right... not even to mention you and me.
MICHAEL=>Beat it, Nanook.
MICHAEL=>Sam. Make him stop.
SAM=>Did you spill something?
MICHAEL=>No. Why?
SAM=>The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
MICHAEL=>I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
SAM=>Wanna go to the comic book store?
MICHAEL=>No.
ALAN=>How do you like Santa Carla?
SAM=>It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
EDGAR=>Or a vampire.
SAM=>Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
EDGAR=>You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you? Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
ALAN=>Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
SAM=>This isn't a comic book store, right. It's a bakery.
EDGAR=>This is just our cover. We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
SAM=>Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
ALAN=>We're fighters for Truth, Justice,
SAM=>You better get some fresh air.
EDGAR=>Hey, man, take this... It's on the house.
SAM=>I don't like horror comics.
ALAN=>Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
SAM=>I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
MAX=>Say hello to Thorn.
LUCY=>Hi, Thorn.
MAX=>You know, Lucy, this isn't working out like I planned.
MAX=>I never get to see you. Which is, of course, why I hired you in the first place. How about dinner one night this week?
LUCY=>You're cute, Max.
MAX=>I know. It's so 'Eighties.' It's the Cute Decade.
MICHAEL=>Ouch.
STAR=>Don't be a baby. That didn't hurt and you know it.
MICHAEL=>I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
STAR=>I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
MICHAEL=>Now you and David...
STAR=>No. They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
MICHAEL=>Let's go see them.
STAR=>No... no, everything's different now...
STAR=>... Michael...
DAVID=>Not interrupting anything, I hope.
STAR=>Look.
DAVID=>You're almost one of us now, Michael.
MICHAEL=>I'm my own man.
DAVID=>Get your bike. We're going someplace.
DAVID=>Don't worry... she'll be here when you get back.
LADDIE=>I had the dream again about them.
STAR=>Who, Laddie?
LADDIE=>I know it was them, Star. I'm sure of it. He was working in the yard -- hammering something. The yard was big with lots of grass. There was no boardwalk and no ocean. She was bringing him something cold to
STAR=>Laddie... you can still remember. You can still remember home.
LADDIE=>It was a dream, Star.
STAR=>No, Laddie. It was a memory.
STAR=>You didn't tell David?
LADDIE=>No. Just you.
STAR=>Promise me you'll keep it that way. You're not like the others, Laddie. You're like me. I can still remember, too.
LADDIE=>You like Michael.
STAR=>I like Michael.
LADDIE=>You better not like him too much.
DAVID=>Perfect time.
MICHAEL=>What's going' on?
DAVID=>What's goin' on, Marko?
MARKO=>I dunno. What's goin' on, Paul?
PAUL=>Who wants to know?
DAVID=>Michael wants to know.
DAVID=>Now you, Michael.
DAVID=>Do it, Michael. Now!
DAVID=>Hang on!!
DAVID=>Let go, Michael! Let go!
DAVID=>Do it!
DAVID=>Do it, Michael!!!
LOST BOYS=>Drop, Michael. Let go! It's safe! Come on! Don't be such a baby!
DAVID=>Almost.
SAM=>Michael, wake up! It's Mom!
MICHAEL=>Mom's home?...
SAM=>No. On the phone.
MICHAEL=>Oh, shit...
SAM=>Michael... are you freebasing? Inquiring minds want to know!
MICHAEL=>Hi, Mom...
LUCY=>Michael, are you still in bed?
MICHAEL=>No. I'm up.
LUCY=>Michael, will you do me a favor this evening? Will you stay home with Sam tonight? I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
MICHAEL=>I watch him all day. The only time I have more myself is at night. Let Grandpa watch him.
LUCY=>Grandpa has plans of his own. Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you. You come home late. You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
LUCY=>Okay?
MICHAEL=>Okay.
GRANDPA=>Anything in here that might pass for after shave?
GRANDPA=>Thanks.
MICHAEL=>Big date, Grandpa?
GRANDPA=>Just dropping off some of my handiwork to the 'Widow' Johnson.
MICHAEL=>Oh, yeah. What'd you stuff for her? Mr. Johnson?
GRANDPA=>See you laters, boys.
SAM=>That wasn't funny.
SAM=>I'm making you a sandwich.
MICHAEL=>Don't bother.
SAM=>Lose the earring, Michael. It's not happening. It's just not happening.
MICHAEL=>Piss off.
SAM=>You have such a great personality, Michael. You should open your own charm school.
MICHAEL=>What's that?...
SAM=>Don't open it!
SAM=>No!!
SAM=>Weird.
MAX=>The video stores are a big success. Wait'll you see the one I'm opening in Los Gatos.
WAITER=>Ready to order now, sir?
LUCY=>I'll just have the fillet of sole.
MAX=>No you won't. We'll start with caviar. Ceasar salad and your two biggest lobsters. This wine as nice, but now I think some Dom Perignon.
WAITER=>Very good, sir.
MAX=>Not impressed, are you?
LUCY=>Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
MAX=>So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
LUCY=>You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
MAX=>But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
LUCY=>I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children. Work with kids in some way. Teenagers, maybe. And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
MAX=>Yeah. Runaways, mostly. They come from all over. Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean. Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
LUCY=>I hear this is the decade for cute.
SAM=>Michael?
MICHAEL=>Don't turn on the light.
SAM=>What happened, Michael!?
MICHAEL=>Nanook...
SAM=>What about Nonook? What have you done to Nanook?! What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
MICHAEL=>Nothing! I didn't hurt him. He bit me! This is my blood!
SAM=>What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
MICHAEL=>He was protecting you!
MICHAEL=>What??
SAM=>Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
SAM=>You're a creature of the night, Michael! Just like the comic book... You're a vampire, Michael! My own brother -- a godamn shit-sucking vampire! Wait'll Mom finds out!
SAM=>Stay back! Stay back!
EDGAR=>You did the right thing, calling us. Does your brother sleep a lot?
SAM=>All day.
ALAN=>Can't stand light?
SAM=>Wears sunglasses in the house.
EDGAR=>Bad breath? Long fingernails?
SAM=>His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
ALAN=>Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
SAM=>Yeah.
ALAN=>He's a vampire alright.
EDGAR=>Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
SAM=>I can't do that!
ALAN=>Why not?
SAM=>He's my brother.
ALAN=>You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
EDGAR=>Or it's your funeral.
SAM=>Hello!
LUCY=>Sam. Is everything all right?
SAM=>Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
LUCY=>What's wrong? Tell me.
SAM=>We can't talk about it on the phone.
SAM=>Oh, no! Oh, God! He's coming to get me! Mom!!!
MICHAEL=>Help me! Sam -- help me! I'm your brother!
MICHAEL=>We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
SAM=>What about Mom?
MICHAEL=>No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.
SAM=>I don't know, Michael. This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
MICHAEL=>Just for a few days, Sam. Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
LUCY=>Sam! What happened!? You had me
SAM=>Sorry, Mom. It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window. I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
LUCY=>Where's Michael?
SAM=>He's already gone to bed.
MAITRE 'D=>I am very sorry. But he is no longer here.
LUCY=>Well, thank you, anyway.
SAM=>Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
LUCY=>In here?
SAM=>Do you mind? It was a real scary comic.
LUCY=>Okay. Have you been eating pizza? You smell like garlic.
MICHAEL=>Star?
MICHAEL=>Star. I have to talk to you.
MICHAEL=>I have to talk to you. Please wake up.
STAR=>Have to sleep. Have to sleep, Michael.
MICHAEL=>When?
STAR=>Tonight. At the boardwalk...
LUCY=>Hi.
LUCY=>What's the matter, Michael? Aren't we friends anymore?
LUCY=>Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
MICHAEL=>We are...
LUCY=>Then let's act like friends. Let's talk. I know this is a new place, and --
LUCY=>-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
MICHAEL=>I'm tired now.
LUCY=>Wait a minute, kiddo.
MICHAEL=>Mom... please.
LUCY=>We haven't even gotten around to this yet!
GRANDPA=>Looks like I wasn't the only one got lucky last night.
SAM=>That it?
LUCY=>Yeah. Not bad, huh?
LUCY=>An apology for running out on Max last night... Actually you should be making this apology.
LUCY=>I better leave this on the front porch or someone's just going to take it...
LUCY=>Hi, Thorn...
SAM=>Mom!!
SAM=>You okay, Mom?
LUCY=>I'm okay, Sam. I'm okay...
EDGAR=>We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
ALAN=>Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
EDGAR=>As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
SAM=>I have something to tell you guys. Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's dating one!
EDGAR=>That is very probable. What's your reasoning?
SAM=>Well... he only shows up at the store after dark. And today, his dog attacked my mom. Listen to this. From Vampires Everywhere... 'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a Guardian -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell -- are often employed for this purpose.'
EDGAR=>I told you that comic would save your life.
EDGAR=>I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
SAM=>How do you know they're not?
ALAN=>They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
SAM=>Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
EDGAR=>All together?
ALAN=>Zero.
EDGAR=>Hey, just because a Marine hasn't seen combat, doesn't mean he still isn't a Marine. Let's check out your mother's boy friend.
GRANDPA=>Smells good. When do we eat?
LUCY=>I told Max eight o'clock.
GRANDPA=>Max? You men we're having company again?
LUCY=>'Again'? Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
GRANDPA=>Right. An' now we're having company again. I'll take mine to go.
LUCY=>Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
MICHAEL=>Can't. Got plans of my own.
LUCY=>There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael. Things are going to change around here when school starts.
MICHAEL=>Gotta go, Mom.
MAX=>Hey. How ya doin'? Michael, right?
MICHAEL=>Yeah. Max... right?
MAX=>You're the man of the house, Michael. I'm not coming in unless you invite me.
MICHAEL=>Come in, come in. I'm inviting you.
MAX=>Thank you very much.
MICHAEL=>See ya.
MAX=>Hello.
MAX=>Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
LUCY=>You're thinking of the groom not
MAX=>Oh, right. I always gets those two confused.
SAM=>Mom...
SAM=>These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan. The Frog Brothers.
LUCY=>Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
SAM=>Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
LUCY=>No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
MAX=>This looks terrific, Lucy.
LUCY=>Boy! Somebody areound here sure has bad breath!
LUCY=>Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
SAM=>C'mere, Nanook.
SAM=>How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
MAX=>Okay, Sam. Thanks.
LUCY=>Max! What's wrong?
MAX=>It's garlic!! I like garlic, but...
SAM=>Quick -- drink some water!
MAX=>Hey! Easy!
SAM=>Does it burn?
MAX=>Burn?? Are you kidding? It's freezing!
LUCY=>Max, I'm so sorry.
LUCY=>Oh, no. Now what?
SAM=>Must be a circuit breaker.
EDGAR=>He's not glowing.
SAM=>Hit the lights again.
LUCY=>Sam! What's gotten into you tonight?!
MAX=>I think I know what's going on here.
EDGAR=>You do?!
MAX=>Sure. I understand what you're thinking, Sam. But you're wrong.
SAM=>I am?
MAX=>Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend.
MAX=>Our batting average isn't very good is it? So far we're zero for two.
LUCY=>I don't understand Sam. He's just not like this.
MAX=>Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
LUCY=>He doesn't walk all over me.
MAX=>I don't want to fight with you, Lucy. Come on. Let's give it one more try. Dinner at my house, tomorrow night. I'm cooking.
MICHAEL=>Where is she?!
DAVID=>Hey, take it easy.
MICHAEL=>Where's Star, David?!
DAVID=>If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
MICHAEL=>What is this, David?
DAVID=>You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
DAVID=>You'll never see Star again if you're not.
DAVID=>Hey, dude. My beach, my wave.
DAVID=>No you know who we are, Michael... and who you are, too.
DAVID=>You'll never grow old and you'll never die. But you must feed.
SAM=>Michael..?
SAM=>I wish he'd stop giving me these things.
MICHAEL=>I know everything.
STAR=>Michael! Michael!
SAM=>It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
MICHAEL=>I don't know.
STAR=>I have to talk to you. Can I come up?
MICHAEL=>Okay.
SAM=>She's one of them!
MICHAEL=>Do you know where David took me tonight, Star? Do you?!
STAR=>Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
MICHAEL=>That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood! David's blood. I'm one of them, Star! I'm just like them!
STAR=>Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
MICHAEL=>Why not?
STAR=>Because I love you...
MICHAEL=>Then it's not too late for us...
STAR=>It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
MICHAEL=>I know, I've felt it...
STAR=>I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
STAR=>David's looking for me... I have to go.
MICHAEL=>You're not going anywhere... Sam...
MICHAEL=>Star.
SAM=>Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
MICHAEL=>Who are you calling?
SAM=>The Marines.
EDGAR=>Okay. Where's Nosferatu?
EDGAR=>The Prince of Darkness.
ALAN=>The nightcrawler. The bloodsucker.
EDGAR=>El Vampiro.
SAM=>They're here Michael, come down here!
EDGAR=>This guy looks more like a zombie.
ALAN=>Should I run him through?
EDGAR=>I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer. Have you taken any human victims yet?
MICHAEL=>Of course not!
EDGAR=>If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
SAM=>He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael?
EDGAR=>To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
MICHAEL=>David.
EDGAR=>I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
MICHAEL=>I'll take you there.
ALAN=>You can barely stand up. Besides... We can't trust you. You're practically one of them.
MICHAEL=>I said, I'll take you there. Nobody's going near Star without me.
EDGAR=>Okay, okay.
EDGAR=>Vampires have such rotten tempers.
SAM=>Grandpa, okay if we borrow the car?
EDGAR=>Just so you know: If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
SAM=>Chill out Edgar.
MICHAEL=>Down there.
MICHAEL=>Sam... if something happens to me. If I don't have the strength to go on, promise me you won't let them hurt Star.
EDGAR=>There's got to be a sleeping chamber around here someplace...
MICHAEL=>Star. You're coming with me.
STAR=>Michael?
MICHAEL=>You've got to put this on.
STAR=>Take laddie.
MICHAEL=>Huh?
ALAN=>Feel it? Feel the draft?
EDGAR=>It's an opening, all right. Let's try it. Somebody give me a boost.
EDGAR=>We're on the right trail. Flies and the undead go together like ham and eggs.
SAM=>What's that smell!?
EDGAR=>Vampires, my friend. Vampires.
SAM=>I thought they'd be in coffins.
EDGAR=>That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin. Let's stake 'em.
DAVID=>You're all dead! YOU'RE DEAD MEAT!
SAM=>Michael! Start the car!
SAM=>I'll have to drive!
ALAN=>We don't ride with vampires.
SAM=>Fine! Stay here!
EDGAR=>Come on. Burn rubber.
SAM=>Burn rubber does not mean warp speed!
ALAN=>We blew it, Edgar! We lost it!
EDGAR=>Shut up!
ALAN=>We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
SAM=>Oh, no...
EDGAR=>What?
SAM=>There's a cop behind us.
ALAN=>Quick! Look older!
EDGAR=>This is all we need! To be caught driving without a license... and in the possession of vampires!
SAM=>Michael! Get behind the wheel.
MICHAEL=>Huh?...
ALAN=>They're gaining on us!
SAM=>You gotta drive!
ALAN=>Red light!!
SAM=>Brake, Michael! Brake!
EDGAR=>They're looking at us.
ALAN=>They're gonna book us.
SAM=>Shut up. Uh... excuse me... which way to the Punk Rock Festival? We're the opening act.
SAM=>No, Nanook! Quiet!
EDGAR=>Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
MICHAEL=>Take him outside, Sam!
GRANDPA=>Michael!
MICHAEL=>No, Grandpa...
GRANDPA=>Well, now you know.
SAM=>Well... we blew Plan A.
ALAN=>Time to activate Plan B.
SAM=>What's Plan B?
EDGAR=>We don't have one yet. And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
SAM=>What happens in tow and a half hours?
EDGAR=>The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
SAM=>Mom! Listen to me! This is very important! Santa Carla is crawling with vampires!
LUCY=>What did you say?
SAM=>Vampires, Mom! Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers! The TV stations! They'll listen to you. They'll believe you... you're a mom!
LUCY=>Not funny, Sam!
SAM=>This is not a joke. They know that we know about them. They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
LUCY=>Stop it, Sam. Stop it right now!
SAM=>But, Mom...
LUCY=>Not another word! I can't believe you're doing this. I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
SAM=>No, I'm not...
LUCY=>There's nothing wrong with Max. I don't know why you don't --
SAM=>-- I'm not talking about Max! To
LUCY=>I'll deal with you later, young man.
SAM=>We're on our own.
ALAN=>Good.
EDGAR=>That's just the way we like it.
SAM=>Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
GRANDPA=>Did we have a date tonight?
SAM=>I guess so. She said not to be late.
GRANDPA=>I better get cleaned up, then.
STAR=>They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
MICHAEL=>They'll be coming for all of us.
MAX=>Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
LUCY=>I hope so.
MAX=>Something the matter?
LUCY=>No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
MAX=>Let me tell you something about boys. They're like weeds. They grow best when they're ignored.
LUCY=>I thought you said they needed discipline?
MAX=>Well... what do I know? I'm a bachelor. Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
EDGAR=>I think I should warn you all: It's never pretty when a vampire buys it. No two bloodsuckers ever go out the same way. Some scream and yell. Some go quietly. Some explode. Some implode. But all will try to take you with them.
SAM=>Nanook! I left him tied up in the yard.
EDGAR=>Don't go out there! Stop him!
MICHAEL=>Sam, don't --
STAR=>It's Paul...
EDGAR=>Where?
EDGAR=>Check that room! You take that one.
EDGAR=>Ahh!!
MICHAEL=>Duck, Sam.
EDGAR=>Alan! Alan! I'm almost out of ammo!!
ALAN=>Did you see that sucker burn?!
EDGAR=>Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
ALAN=>Two down and two to go.
EDGAR=>Four to go.
ALAN=>Whattaya mean?
EDGAR=>Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid. I don't trust 'em. I say we terminate 'em while we can.
ALAN=>You know what? You're absolutely right.
EDGAR=>Death to all vampires!
ALAN=>Maximum body-count.
EDGAR=>We are awesome monster-bashers!
ALAN=>The meanest!
EDGAR=>The baddest!
STAR=>Laddie... NO.
SAM=>Nanook! He's going to burst!
DAVID=>Just you and me now, Michael. One on one. Fight to the finish.
DAVID=>It's over, Michael. You're the only one left. They're all dead. Sam and Star, too. All dead.
DAVID=>Give up, Michael! You're one of us. Don't you understand that? You're one of us!
DAVID=>Don't make me kill you!
SAM=>We have to help him!
EDGAR=>How?! We can't get out!
STAR=>I can.
STAR=>Leave him alone!
DAVID=>You can't kill me, Star.
DAVID=>No, Star. Put it down. Put it down.
MICHAEL=>David!
MICHAEL=>Catch!
DAVID=>Ahhhhhh!!
EDGAR=>You destroyed David. His hold on you has been released.
SAM=>What's the matter?
MICHAEL=>I... I don't feel any differently. Do you?
EDGAR=>That means we still haven't destroyed their leader.
SAM=>Someone's here.
LUCY=>Ohmygod...
SAM=>Mom!
LUCY=>What happened? Is everybody all right?!
MAX=>Where are my boys?...
MAX=>Where's David? Where are the others?!
LUCY=>Max... what are you talking about?
MAX=>It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy. One big happy family. My boys... and yours.
EDGAR=>I knew it! You are a vampire!
LUCY=>Vampire?...
SAM=>But you passed the test!
MAX=>Michael invited me in. Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
SAM=>What?! Did you know that!?
EDGAR=>Sure. The invitation protects them.
LUCY=>Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
MAX=>It's you I was after all along, Lucy. To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
MAX=>I still want you, Lucy... I haven't changed my mind about that.
MICHAEL=>I didn't invite you in this time!
LUCY=>Michael!...
MICHAEL=>Get out, Mom! Run!
MAX=>Come on, boy. Come and save your mother.
MAX=>Don't fight. It's so much better if you don't fight.
LUCY=>Everybody okay?
MICHAEL=>It's gone. I feel it!
STAR=>So do I!
LADDIE=>Me, too!
MICHAEL=>Everyone accounted for?
GRANDPA=>The one thing about livin' in Santa Carla I never could stomach... All the damn vampires.
