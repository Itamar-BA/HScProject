MARNIE=>I brought bagels.
DIANE=>How do you feel?
LORI=>I’m not alone.
MARNIE=>Don’t say that.
LORI=>I have no idea.
FREDDY=>What do you mean?
FREDDY=>We can avoid it.
GUY IN HEAD-SET=>On “background” you cross and talk to the woman in the blue hat.
ITALIAN WOMAN=>Well, of course, Sinatra, but should it be “My Way”....
JILLIAN=>She’s too pretty.
MARNIE=>You really look beautiful.
MARNIE=>Ooh, what’s that?
FREDO=>Thanks, Mrs. M.
MARNIE=>Oh, that’s nice.
COP/ZIPPER=>And you are, Miss...
ZIPPER=>Miss Minervini...
ZIPPER=>Mrs. Minervini...
ZIPPER=>We have a very symbiotic relationship. I give them a coop and some grass and sometimes a little Parmesan cheese and they keep me in eggs.
MARNIE=>Thank God you’re retired.
DIRECTOR=>Aaaaaaand.... cut.
MARNIE=>How do you take a selfie?
MARNIE=>Nobody. Shhhhh.
ANGIE=>You lost weight.
MARNIE=>Oh, yeah, right.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT=>Welcome to Los Angeles where the local time is 9:37am. Please remain in your seats while we taxi to the gate. If your cell phone is in reach, you may use it now.
ZIPPER=>But I wanted to try you back and see how the east coast is treating you. And also let you know that the chickens have expanded their musical library to include Peggy Lee, as well as Dolly Parton covers, so you’ve got that to look forward to. If you ever make it back this way. But... give me a call if you get a chance. Okay.
ZIPPER=>Oh. That’s fun.
JILLIAN=>I want to thank all of my bridesmaids. Nobody could ask for thirteen better friends. I love you all so much.
MARK=>So about that lunch....
MARNIE=>She loves you.
LORI=>What the what?
MARNIE=>I said like AIDS.
LORI=>This isn’t funny, Mom.
MARNIE=>We’re not alone.
ZIPPER=>I don’t think so.
LORI=>Okay, I’m officially worried. Where are you? Call me. This is weird. This is your daughter.
JILLIAN=>The nanny is sick and Dani and I have this thing at seven....
JILLIAN=>So if you could be here by then...
