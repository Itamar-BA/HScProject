RIGGS=>Do I look like a homo?
RIGGS=>Boy, you guys are terrific. You make me laugh, you just do.
RIGGS=>This your dog? Nice dog.
RIGGS=>Huh- You know what? He says he doesn't want you to spray beer in his face. He says he just hates that.
RIGGS=>Okay.
RIGGS=>What ... ? You want ... oh. Oh, hell no, I couldn't do that ... Nossirree bob, you little nut.
RIGGS=>Get this: He wants me to beat the shit out of you guys.
RIGGS=>What's that ... ? The one ... in the middle... 'is a stupid fat duck'... What ... ? Oh ... Oh! A 'stupid fat fuck!' Right.
RIGGS=>Boy, this dog is pissed.
RIGGS=>What's that ... ? You want me to take the knife away... and break his elbow... ?
RIGGS=>But that would be excruciatingly painful ...
RIGGS=>And if I separated the fat one's shoulder... he'd probably scream...
RIGGS=>Okay, skeezix. Go on. Get outta here.
RIGGS=>No, no. Don't follow me. I'm an asshole. Go away.
RIGGS=>Aw, shit.
RIGGS=>Awright. Move it. Let's go.
RIGGS=>So. You live in the area? What's your major ... ?
CARRIE=>Make a wish, Daddy.
RIANNE=>Go for it, Dad.
MURTAUGH=>Go for it, huh...? Okay, I'll go for it.
RIGGS=>Sam, today is the first day ... of the rest of my life.
MURTAUGH=>Honey, what's this on my tie?
TRISH=>An ugly spot?
MURTAUGH=>Thanks. Sharp as a pin.
TRISH=>I'm thinking of going on 'Jeopardy.'
MURTAUGH=>Don't take any questions on cooking.
TRISH=>Thanks. I love you, too.
MURTAUGH=>Hey, kid, turn off the waterworks, okay?
CARRIE=>Daddy, he changed the channel!
MURTAUGH=>NOOOOOO.
NICK=>She's a crybaby, Dad.
MURTAUGH=>Mind your own busines. That's illegal.
NICK=>What's illegal?
MURTAUGH=>Can't put a dead body in an ambulance. This 'Kojak'?
NICK=>'Starsky and Hutch.'
MURTAUGH=>Huh. It's illegal. Never put a dead body in an ambulance, son, you got that?
NICK=>Sure, Dad.
MURTAUGH=>Honey, where's the spot remover? Young lady, stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about. Damn.
MURTAUGH=>That's it. I'm gonna give you something to cry about.
MURTAUGH=>Starving children. See? They haven't eaten, it's very sad. Cry.
CARRIE=>Daddy, you're weird ...
MURTAUGH=>Thank you, Carrie. Hear that, honey, the children think I'm weird.
TRISH=>They're bright children. Honey, you know a man named Dick Lloyd? Don't step in the egg.
MURTAUGH=>Where's my thinking? I should've checked the floor for egg. Dick Lloyd ... ? Jesus, Dick Lloyd. What's he want?
TRISH=>The office called. He's been trying to reach you for three days now.
MURTAUGH=>I haven't talked to him in... shit, twelve years? No, wait a minute, that would make me fifty years old, that can't be right.
TRISH=>You're not getting older, you're getting better.
MURTAUGH=>Inform the children of this. Forget the eggs, I'll eat later.
TRISH=>Whatever. Honey? How come I never heard of Dick Lloyd?
MURTAUGH=>I never talked about him.
TRISH=>Oh. Vietnam buddy?
MURTAUGH=>Yeah. Vietnam buddy.
MURTAUGH=>Hey.
RIANNE=>'Bye, Daddy.
MURTAUGH=>Goddamn heartbreaker. She's a heartbreaker.
MURTAUGH=>Happy birthday to me ...

DIXIE=>Can I stay in the car?
DIXIE=>Aw, cut me a break. I told you already: she came out on the balcony --
DIXIE=>-- No, the Chandler fucking Pavillion, of course that fucking balcony, and then slie jumped, and then I puked in a trash can. Can I go now?
DIXIE=>Terrific. Where the hell is he?
BEAT COP=>Happy 50th, Rog.
MURTAUGH=>Fuck you.
MURTAUGH=>'Morning, Phil. Get some rain, looks like. Hey, Dixie. Nice threads.

DIXIE=>You're hilarious.
MURTAUGH=>What's that?
MURTAUGH=>Eat me.
MURTAUGH=>What was the name?
MURTAUGH=>I knew her dad.
MURTAUGH=>Find out who bought it for her. Her sugar daddy.
MURTAUGH=>So look.
MURTAUGH=>Hello, honey ... ? Give me the number for Dick Lloyd. What ... ? Yes, the man who called me this morning. His daughter just took a dive out a window.
RIGGS=>Good stuff.
DRUG DEALER ONE=>You better fuckin' believe it.
RIGGS=>Okay. Let's do it. How much?
DRUG DEALER TWO=>How much for how much?
RIGGS=>For all of it.
DRUG DEALER THREE=>You want it all?
RIGGS=>Yeah. And maybe a nice big six-footer to put it under.
DRUG DEALER ONE=>The tree you can have for nuthin'. But the shit is gonna run you a hundred.
RIGGS=>That much, huh? Okay. Let's see what I got.
RIGGS=>Twenty, forty, sixty --
DRUG DEALER ONE=>Hey, man. Hey!
RIGGS=>Wait, wait ... shutup. I'm losin count. Where was I? Oh, yeah... ... Eight, ninety, ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven... ... Ninety-seven-fifty. Sixty. Seventy-five. Okay, there's ninety-eight dollars and twenty cents...

RIGGS=>C'mon. I'm almost there. Gimme a minute to --
DRUG DEALER ONE=>One hundred thousand, you stupid fuck! One hundred thousand!
RIGGS=>Oh, Jesus ... I can't afford that. Not on my salary. Look... let's do this instead ... I take your complete stash, okay? I take it all. For free. And you assholes go to jail.
RIGGS=>I could read you your rights, but ... nah. You guys know what your rights are.
DRUG DEALER ONE=>Fuck you, man. That badge ain't real. And you ain't real.
DRUG DEALER TWO=>But you're sure as hell one crazy fuck!
RIGGS=>You callin' me crazy!? You think I'm crazy! You, wanna see crazy? I'll show you crazy! This is crazy!
RIGGS=>That's a real badge. I'm a real cop. And this is a real gun. Face down on the ground. Arms and legs out. Do it now!

PSYCHOLOGIST=>I want Martin Riggs pulled from duty.
MURPHY=>Um... no.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>No. No??? Captain, he walked into the line of fire.
MURPHY=>Very brave individual, don't you think... ?
PSYCHOLOGIST=>This is utter bullshit.
MURPHY=>Oh, is it? Forgive me.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Martin Riggs is a cop with a death wish.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>You can quote me. It happens to be my professional opinion.
MURPHY=>Um... good opinion. See you tomorrow.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Captain...
MURPHY=>Look, Doc, you're way off. Way off. Know what I think? I think Riggs is pulling for a psycho pension.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Oh, do you?
MURPHY=>Yeah. I am sure you're aware the department offers a disability stress pension --
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Yes, I'm aware --
MURPHY=>-- Except we don't offer it to everybody, only cops who seem to suffer from
PSYCHOLOGIST=>-- From abnormal stress, yes, I know. Or suicidal tendencies.
MURPHY=>Give the lady a cigar.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>You think Riggs is playing a game?
MURPHY=>Sure. He wants the cash. Seen it a hundred times. He'll come around.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Sir, with all due respect ... I think that's a dangerous attitude to take. May I remind you that his wife of eleven years was recently killed in a car accident, and
MURPHY=>I know all about Riggs, Doc. He's a tough bastard.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>He is on the edge. He may be psychotic.
MURPHY=>Bunch of psych bullshit- Look, can I pee now?
PSYCHOLOGIST=>I think you're making a mistake by leaving him in the field. He's suicidal.
MURPHY=>End of discussion. We're gonna wait. And then, if he offs himself ... Well, then we'll know I was wrong.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Yes, sir. Then we'll know.
RIGGS=>Sam, every day ... in every way ... I'm getting better and better.
MURTAUGH=>How you figure?
MURTAUGH=>Were you with a woman? McCASKEY No, I was alone, why the fuck you think I was crying?
MURTAUGH=>Sounds like an Eighties man to me.
BURKE=>Got some news on the Lloyd case, Rog.
MURTAUGH=>That was quick.
BURKE=>So was the autopsy. You ready for this? They're not calling it suicide.
MURTAUGH=>What?
BURKE=>Surprise, surprise. First off, coroner found evidence she took barbiturates.
MURTAUGH=>Brilliant. There was an open bottle on her table.
BURKE=>Right, right. That's not the surprise. Surprise is someone doctored the pills. Every capsule was loaded with drain cleaner.
MURTAUGH=>Jesus ...
BURKE=>If she hadn't jumped, she woulda been dead inside fifteen minutes.
MURTAUGH=>This case blows.
MURTAUGH=>McCaskey, if my wife calls, tell her late dinner.
BURKE=>Ho, Rog- I'm not through yet. I'm supposed to tell you two more things.
MURTAUGH=>Shoot.
BURKE=>First, condition of the sheets and mattress indicate someone was in bed with Amanda Lloyd just before she died. That's A.
MURTAUGH=>What's B?
BURKE=>B is, I'm supposed to tell you you're breaking in a new partner on this.
MURTAUGH=>I don't work partners.
BURKE=>You do now. C.I.T. transfer, some burnout they want you to keep on a leash.
MURTAUGH=>Oh, perfect. Can I trade in my life for a new one?
MURTAUGH=>Gun !!
BURKE=>Roger just met his new partner.
MAN=>There are three guns on you.
VISITOR=>Easy. Take it easy. I'm going to light a match.
MAN=>Thank you, Mr. Mendez.
LEADER=>If you'll follow me, please.
MENDEZ=>Who the hell are you?
LEADER=>That's hardly important. If you like, you may call me Mr. Joshua.
MENDEZ=>Swell.
JOSHUA=>I trust you're having a pleasant holiday season?
MENDEZ=>Yeah. It's a fucking joy, thank you.
GENERAL=>Yes, Joshua... ? Ah, Mr. Mendez. Please, have a seat.
MENDEZ=>Where'd you get him? Psychos 'R.' Us?
GENERAL=>Hardly.
MENDEZ=>I like the sunglasses. Very Hollywood.
GENERAL=>Mr. Larch is unfortunately missing an eye. For anonymity's sake, he chooses to forego wearing a patch.
MENDEZ=>Swell. Blind people with guns. This is a class act. Maybe we can run over to the V.A. and pick up a couple amputees. Bargain rates after six.
GENERAL=>I don't find you funny.
MENDEZ=>I don't find this goddamn setup funny. You're using mercenaries, for Chrissake. Tell me I'm wrong.
GENERAL=>No. You're not wrong.
MENDEZ=>And I'm supposed to trust these bozos?
GENERAL=>My people are loyal, Mr. Mendez. They are loyal to me.
MENDEZ=>Bullshit.
GENERAL=>Joshua. Hold out your hand.
GENERAL=>Do you smoke, Mr. Mendez?
MENDEZ=>Yeah.
GENERAL=>Give me your lighter.
GENERAL=>You wish to do business with us, yes?
MENDEZ=>Jesus ...
GENERAL=>Mr. Joshua is in a great deal of pain. You wish to make a purchase, yes?
MENDEZ=>I ... yes. Sure. Jesus.
GENERAL=>Filthy habit, smoking. The bulk of the heroin will arrive Friday night. We will make delivery at that time. Please have the money ready, and no tricks. If you try to cross us, I'll have Joshua cut out your eyes. Merry Christmas.
MURTAIJGH=>Turn right. So. They tell me you're a good cop.
RIGGS=>I try.
MURTAUGH=>Heard about your little stunt yesterday. Pretty heroic stuff. File says you worked for the Phoenix Project in Vietnam, that right?
RIGGS=>Yes.
MURTAUGH=>Assassin stuff?
RIGGS=>Maybe.
MURTAUGH=>And they gave you the Congressional Medal of Honor.
RIGGS=>It was a lean year.
MURTAUGH=>It's over, you know.
RIGGS=>What is?
MURTAUGH=>The war.
RIGGS=>Yes. I know.
MURTAUGH=>Just thought I'd remind you. Check out your piece?
RIGGS=>Bad manners, man.
RIGGS=>Don't hurt yourself.
MURTAUGH=>.9 millimeter Beretta. That's some serious shit.
RIGGS=>Military switched from Colt to Beretta in 1985. It's a better piece. Wide ejection port, no feed jams, no stovepipes.
MURTAUGH=>What's it take?
RIGGS=>Fifteen in the mag, one up the pipe. You carry a wheelgun?
MURTAUGH=>.38 Special.
RIGGS=>Lot of old-timers carry that.
MURTAUGH=>File says you're registered with Newark P.D. as a lethal weapon.
RIGGS=>File don't lie. Look, friend, let's cut the shit. We both know why I was transferred. Everyone thinks I'm suicidal, in which case I'm fucked and no one wants to work with me. Or they think I'm faking to draw a psycho pension, in which case I'm fucked and no one wants to work with me. Basically, I'm fucked.
MURTAUGH=>Guess what?
RIGGS=>What?
MURTAUGH=>I don't want to work with you.
RIGGS=>Then don't.
MURTAUGH=>Ain't got no choice. Damn. We're both fucked.
RIGGS=>Terrific.
MURTAUGH=>I'm very old ... ... God hates me, that's what it is.
RIGGS=>Hate him back. Works for me.
LLOYD=>Murder ... But I thought ...
MURTAUGH=>Poisoned. Even if she hadn't jumped ... she'd still be dead.
LLOYD=>Jesus. Jesus, I can't take -------.
MURTAUGH=>Dick, why did you call me yesterday?
LLOYD=>Called you...? Yeah. That's right ... I heard you were working out here ... I wanted you to find her for me, Roger. Take her
MURTAUGH=>Out of what?
LLOYD=>She did movies, Roger ... Naked movies ... Saw one of them...... saw my little baby ... smiling...... She did it ... with a woman. She was on top of a woman, Roger-...!
MURTAUGH=>Easy, Dick.
LLOYD=>I want a promise. You owe me. You know you do.
MURTAUGH=>Yes. I know that.
LLOYD=>When you find who did it, I want you to kill them. If it's more than one, I want you to kill all of them. Make them squirm first, take your time ... and fucking kill them.
MURTAUGH=>I'm a police officer, Dick.
LLOYD=>Forget the law. It's easy to do. You owe me.
MURTAUGH=>We have to go now.
LLOYD=>I know you can, Roger. You kill them. You do that.
MURTAUGH=>You gonna smoke in the car?
RIGGS=>Thinking about it.
MURTAUGH=>Terrific.
RIGGS=>Whoops. Shit.
MURTAUGH=>What was wrong with that one?
RIGGS=>This one is the last cigarette I'll ever smoke. Trick I learned from my dad. I smoke all I want, but when I smoke this one ... I'm through.
MURTAUGH=>Brilliant. Get in the car.
RIGGS=>Want me to drive?
MURTAUGH=>You're suicidal, remember?
RIGGS=>Anyone who drives in Los Angeles is suicidal.
RIGGS=>He said you owed him. What did he mean?
MURTAUGH=>We served together in '65. He saved my life in the La Drang Valley. Took a bayonet in the lung.
RIGGS=>That was nice of him.
MURTAUGH=>I thought so.
DISPATCHER=>All units and seven eight twenty-one, possible jumper at the corner of Santa Monica and La Cienega, seven eight twenty- one handle code two.
MURTAUGH=>Four King Sixty en route.
RIGGS=>This is great. I love this job.
MURTAUGH=>Stow it.
PATROL COP=>Hey, Sarge, you wanna handle this?
MURTAUGH=>Where's the psychologist?
PATROL COP=>Sitting in traffic.
MURTAUGH=>Swell. Who's the guy?
PATROL COP=>Salesman name of MacCleary. Left the office party. Went upstairs and walked out on the ledge.
MURTAUGH=>Think he'll go?
PATROL COP=>Seems serious enough. Who knows?
RIGGS=>I can handle this.
MURTAUGH=>You qualified to talk to jumpers?
RIGGS=>I've done it before.
MURTAUGH=>Okay. You're elected. Hey. No guns. No kung fu. Just ... bring him in.
RIGGS=>Sure. Bring him in.
MURTAUGH=>Right.
RIGGS=>My name is Riggs.
RIGGS=>I can't do that. What's your name?
RIGGS=>I'm not a psychologist.
RIGGS=>Homicide cop.
RIGGS=>At least tell me your name. Look, I gotta fill out the little piece of paper. Okay?
RIGGS=>Thanks. 'Preciate it. That M -- C ... ?
RIGGS=>Why are you doing this?
RIGGS=>Fair enough. I'm coming out. Take it easy.
RIGGS=>Ssshhh. Easy. I'm just going to talk.
RIGGS=>I understand.
RIGGS=>You're not the first guy to think of this, you know. Everyone's got problems.
RIGGS=>Wrong. You're wrong. I almost tried this once. Seriously. My wife. Got killed in a car crash. Only person I ever cared about. I never had kids.
RIGGS=>This is her picture.
RIGGS=>I'm trying to tell you I understand, you dope.
RIGGS=>I know that. Not like you're murdering anyone.
RIGGS=>Same way I look at it. I'm gonna stand beside you, okay?
RIGGS=>Please. This is scary stuff. Just ... let me stand next to you.
RIGGS=>I try something, we both go.
RIGGS=>There. Fuckin' cold,up here. Helluva day for both of us, huh? Here we are. God, this is really scary. I'm scared.
RIGGS=>You wanna smoke? Let's smoke, okay?
RIGGS=>Sorry. See this key?
RIGGS=>We're together on this. You can go if you want. But you take me with you. Makes you a murderer.
RIGGS=>You'll be killing a cop.
RIGGS=>I'm going inside. What say you come with me?
RIGGS=>You wanna jump ... ? You really want to ... ? Fine. Let's do it.
RIGGS=>You asked for it.
RIGGS=>Geronimoooooo ...
RIGGS=>Don't ... touch me.
MURTAUGH=>What the fuck did you just do???
RIGGS=>I controlled the jump. You wanted him down. He's down.
MURTAUGH=>C'mere.
MURTAUGH=>Okay, turkey, no bullshit. Do you want to kill yourself?
RIGGS=>Aw, for Chrissake ...
MURTAUGH=>Shut up. Just yes or no, do you want to die? Huh? Yes or no?
RIGGS=>I got the job done.
MURTAUGH=>You're not answering the question!!!
RIGGS=>What do you wanna hear, man? You wanna hear that I got a bottle of pills in my room? I do. Every day I wake up, I look for a reason not to take them. Doing the job, that's ... that's the reason.
MURTAUGH=>You want to die.
RIGGS=>I'm not afraid of it.
MURTAUGH=>Here. Pills are too slow. Use a gun. Use my gun. Go ahead, pal.
MURTAUGH=>Be my guest.
MURTAUGH=>Go ahead. If you're serious.
RIGGS=>You shouldn't tempt me, Roger.
MURTAUGH=>Put it in your mouth. Bullet goes in your ear, might not kill you.
RIGGS=>Under the chin's just as good.
MURTAUGH=>Jesus. You're not trying to draw a psycho pension. You're really crazy ...
RIGGS=>So now you know.
MURTAUGH=>Yeah. Now I know.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>You're asking me if he's stable and I'm telling you no. We're talking about a man who carves notches in his gun barrel. Ore for each kill. He blew a man to Pieces yesterday. Is this helping?
MURTAUGH=>Terrific. So you're saying I should worry.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Are you kidding? The guy's a time bomb. When he goes... stand back.
MURTAUGH=>Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
MURTAUGH=>I'm too old for this shit.
MURTAUGH=>It's my birthday, damnit! Fifty years old today! Fifty goddamn years old! Thirty years on the force! Not a scratch on me! Not a scar! I got a wife! Kids! House! Fishing boat! But I can kiss all that goodbye, 'cause my new partner's got a death wish! My fuckin' life is over!
RIGGS=>Roger --
MURTAUGH=>Shut up! Why you talkin' to me?! I'm not he're anymore! I'm gone! I'm dead! You're gonna see to that! You wanna die -- and you're gonna take me with you!
RIGGS=>I didn't know that.
MURTAUGH=>Know what?!
RIGGS=>That today was your birthday. Happy Birthday, Roger. I mean that sincerely.
RIGGS=>I just hope we stay alive long enough for me to buy you a present.
RIGGS=>Where we going?
MURTAUGH=>Beverly Hills. Got an address on Amanda Hunsecker's meal ticket. But remember ... this guy isn't a suspect yet. We're gonna question him; not damage him.
RICH GUY=>Listens asshole, you gotta tell me these things ... Yeah, we got a problem. My margin is completely fucked up, and we got athletes snorting the shit and pitching over dead, how's that for a problem... ? Yes, I'm holding two keys now. Terrific, call me back.
RIGGS=>Take a look.
RIGGS=>I'm thinking probable cause.
MURTAUGH=>Jesus. Maybe I should call for backup.
RIGGS=>What am I, chopped liver?
MURTAUGH=>No killing.
RIGGS=>No killing.
MURTAUGH=>Nice and easy.
RIGGS=>Nice and easy.
MURTAUGH=>Police. Hold it right there.
MURTAUGH=>See how easy that was? Boom. Still alive. Now we take the gun away ... ... And we question him. Know why we can question him? Because I got him in the shoulder. I didn't blow him up or jump off a building with him.
RIGGS=>No fair, the building guy lived.
MURTAUGH=>Whatever. The point is, no killing.
RIGGS=>No killing.
MURTAUGH=>Right. Piece of cake. I'm very happy. Read the man his rights, I'll be over here being happy.
RIGGS=>Oops.
MURTAUGH=>Have you ... ever... met someone you didn't kill... ?
RIGGS=>Haven't killed you yet.
MURTAUGH=>Terrific, you want a little gold star? Shit.
MURTAUGH=>Look, I' m sorry I said that shit back there. You saved my life. Thank you.
RIGGS=>I bet that hurt to say.
MURTAUGH=>You have no idea.
CARRIE=>Hi, Daddy. Is that a crook?
MURTAUGH=>No, honey, this is Martin, my partner. Tell Martin what you think of crooks.
CARRIE=>Buttheads. They're buttheads.
RIGGS=>Kid's no dummy.
CARRIE=>Daddy, Mommy says you hate her cooking.
MURTAUGH=>Tell Mommy hate is a mild word.
MURTAUGH=>Hi, honey. We're having something brown... A largish brown object ...
TRISH=>It's roast.
MURTAUGH=>Dammit, I wanted to guess. Honeny, this is Martin, my new partner. He'll be joining us tonight, okay?
TRISH=>Sure. Roast okay with you, Martin?
RIGGS=>Fine.
MURTAUGH=>How about brown, roast-like substance?
TRISH=>Roger, you're being an asshole. Don't forget to compliment Rianne on her shoes.
MURTAUGH=>Got it. Drink, Martin?
RIGGS=>Bourbon, if you have it.
RIGGS=>My wife could burn water.
TRISH=>You're married?
RIGGS=>I was. She's dead now.
TRISH=>Oh. I'm sorry.
RIGGS=>No problem.
TRISH=>Don't pick.-
RIANNE=>Hello, Father.
MURTAUGH=>Hello, daughter. Nice shoes.
RIANNE=>Oh, Daddy, aren't they great?
MURTAUGH=>Absolutely. How much they cost?
RIANNE=>A hundred and ten dollars. Do you really like them?
MURTAUGH=>A hundred and -- -- They're shoes.
RIANNE=>Right.
MURTAUGH=>You wear them on your feet.
RIANNE=>Right.
MURTAUGH=>And that's all they do ... ? There's not, like a TV inside?
RIANNE=>Nope.
MURTAUGH=>I'm very old.
RIGGS=>This is good. I like this.
TRISH=>That's okay, honey. I'll take out the garbage.
MURTAUGH=>Yeah. Thanks, honey.
MURTAUGH=>Whaddaya think?
RIGGS=>You know anything about boats, Roger?
MURTAUGH=>Know how much they cost.
RIGGS=>I mean, can you sail this thing?
MURTAUGH=>What's wrong with you? This ain't a sail boat.
RIGGS=>That's what I thought.
MURTAUGH=>No trick to it. That's the front. That's the back. Water all around. Why you gotta make things so complicated?
RIGGS=>I don't. That's just how they are.
MURTAUGH=>Oh, yeah. You mean Amanda Hunsacker's murder?
RIGGS=>Now, did I mention that?
MURTAUGH=>You don't have to. I can read your mind.
MURTAUGH=>I don't get you, Riggs. What's the problem? We got one dead girl and one dead guy. Dead guy killed the dead girl and we killed the dead guy 'cause he wanted us to be dead guys. Seems pretty easy to me.
MURTAUGH=>Look, her sugar daddy was dealin' drugs. She said somethin'... or did somethin'... or saw somethin' she shouldn't have, and he pitched her off the balcony into the sweet by-an'-by. That's why he came at us today with a shotgun.
RIGGS=>I don't know. Sounds a little too neat to me.
MURTAUGH=>Of course it's neat. And what's wrong with neat? I like neat.
MURTAUGH=>Hey! Watch what you're doin'!
RIGGS=>Lookin' for this?
MURTAUGH=>You asshole.
RIANNE=>Hi, Dad...
MURTAUGH=>What is it, Rianne?
RIANNE=>Mark wants to take me out to a club tomorrow night.
MURTAUGH=>You're grounded -- you know that.
RIANNE=>Please, Daddy ...
MURTAUGH=>Which one is Mark, anyway?
RIANNE=>The blond one.
MURTAUGH=>Oh, yeah. The one with pits in his face.
RIANNE=>Those are dimples.
MURTAUGH=>Those are pits. When he smiles, I can see through his head. The answer is no. End of story.
RIGGS=>C'mon, Rog. Have a heart.
MURTAUGH=>The girl was smoking pot in the house. She's grounded!
RIANNE=>Next time I'll just take a beer instead. Why can I have a beer and not a joint? It's not coke, you know, Dad.
MURTAUGH=>'Cause right now, beer's legal and grass ain't. Right or wrong.
RIANNE=>Wrong.
RIGGS=>Right.
MURTAUGH=>I've lost track... did we resolve anything here tonight?
RIGGS=>Yeah. We resolved that your wife takes out the garbage. Your daughter smokes pot, which is illegal but shouldn't be -- that you don't know from boats, and you got one hell of a family, guy.
MURTAUGH=>Thanks.
RIGGS=>Enjoyed the meal.
MURTAUGH=>Bullshit, but thanks anyway.
RIGGS=>You don't trust me at all, do you?
MURTAUGH=>Tell you what. Make it through tomorrow without killing anybody. Especially me. Or yourself. Then I'll start trusting you.
RIGGS=>Fair enough.
RIGGS=>I do it real good, you know.
MURTAUGH=>Do what?
RIGGS=>Kill people ... Only thing I ever did good. When I was nineteen, I did a guy in Laos from a thousand yards out. Rifle shot in high wind. Ten guys in the world coulda made that shot. Huh. Only thing I was ever good at. Well, see you tomorrow.
MURTAUGH=>Yeah. See you then.
HOOKER=>Hi, handsome. Looking for something?
RIGGS=>Aren't we all?
HOOKER=>Are you affiliated with any law enforcement organization?
RIGGS=>No. Get in the car.
RIGGS=>How old are you?
HOOKER=>Twenty-two.
RIGGS=>Bullshit.
HOOKER=>Why, you like 'em young?
RIGGS=>Younger the better. How old are you?
HOOKER=>Sixteen.
HOOKER=>Wow. So, what do you want?
RIGGS=>I want you to come home and watch television with me.
MURTAUGH=>Hey.
HOOKER=>You're not having a very good time, are you?
RIGGS=>You don't know that. Maybe this is how I look when I'm having a good time. Maybe I'm having the best time of my life.
HOOKER=>Are you?
HOOKER=>I know... sing me something.
RIGGS=>I don't sing.
HOOKER=>Come on. Sing me a song.
RIGGS=>I don't know any songs.
HOOKER=>Not even a Christmas song? Everybody knows a Christmas song.
RIGGS=>Something through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh ...
HOOKER=>Good. That's good. Over the hills we go, laughing all the way.
RIGGS=>Something something ring, making something bright ...
HOOKER=>Oh, what fun it is to ride ...
RIGGS=>To grandma's house tonight!
RIGGS=>I better take you back now.
RIANNIE=>... Mark ...
MURTAUGH=>... Martin... ?
RIGGS=>Good morning, Roger. I've been doing a little thinking.
RIGGS=>About the night Amanda Hunsak.er died.
MURTAUGH=>Do you know what time it is ... ?
RIGGS=>Day time?
MURTAUGH=>I'll get dressed.
RIGGS=>You're seriously using ketchup?
MURTAUGH=>Yeah.
RIGGS=>On eggs.
MURTAUGH=>Yeah. Who made the ketchup?
RIGGS=>Heinz.
MURTAUGH=>Who made the eggs?
TRISH=>You two are so hilarious I could bust.
RIGGS=>Roger.
MURTAUGH=>Yeah.
RIGGS=>That hooker who witnessed the jump the other night. What was her name?
MURTAUGH=>Dixie.
CARRIE=>What's a hooker?
MURTAUGH=>Shh, quiet, I'm combatting crime.
NICK=>A hooker is a ...
RIGGS=>Right, and she's in Century City witnessing Amanda Hunsaker's suicide
MURTAUGH=>or murder --
RIGGS=>right, or murder, and my question is... what is she doing there? I called Wilshire Vice, that's not her usual turf.
MURTAUGH=>Wow. Wow. That's really reaching.
RIGGS=>Cut me a break, it's a hunch, Roger. I'm having a hunch.
MURTAUGH=>You couldn't have it at home, you had to come here at 7:30 A.M. and have it.
RIGGS=>7:35, and yes, I thought you'd be excited.
MURTAUGH=>I'm thrilled. Okay.
RIGGS=>Okay, what?
MURTAUGH=>Okay, go for it. I'm listening.
MURTAUGH=>We know someone was in bed with Amanda Lloyd the night she died.
RIGGS=>Right. 'Til now we assumed it was a man.
MURTAUGH=>Okay. Let's say it was Dixie.
RIGGS=>Okay. Disgusting, but okay: Let's say Dixie slipped the drain cleaner into the pills.
MURTAUGH=>Say someone paid her to do it.
RIGGS=>Sure. She thinks, terrific, Amanda swallows a couple downers and boom, she's dead. Then Dixie --
MURTAUGH=>If it was her --
RIGGS=>Right, right, then Dixie has plenty of time to spritz the place up, get out, whatever.
MURTAUGH=>Except Amanda jumps out the window.
RIGGS=>Or Dixie pushes her. Either way
MURTAUGH=>Either way, she's gotta make a fast getaway, 'cause now the body's public. She hauls ass downstairs.
RIGGS=>People are coming out to see what happened.
MURTAUGH=>Someone spots her. She says 'shit.'
RIGGS=>Right. She actually stops and says, 'Shit.'
MURTAUGH=>Or, 'Damn.'
RIGGS=>Or 'Golly, I've been spotted.' The point being --
MURTAUGH=>The point being, now she has to cover her ass.
RIGGS=>Right. So she says, 'Officer, officer, I saw the whole thing.'
MURTAUGH=>Right.
RIGGS=>Right.
MURTAUGH=>That's pretty fucking thin.
RIGGS=>Very thin.
MURTAUGH=>Hell with it. Thin's my middle name.
RIGGS=>Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.
MURTAUGH=>Would you lay off the cooking?
RIGGS=>Tell her that.
MURTAUGH=>You sleep with that thing under your pillow?
RIGGS=>I would if I slept.
MURTAUGH=>Here, stand back.
MURTAUGH=>Hey-hey. Would'ja look at that? Pretty good for an old man.
MURTAUGH=>Yeah, yeah. Eat me.
RIGGS=>Hey, kid. What'cha doing?
LITTLE KID=>I put this on top and it fall down.
RIGGS=>Good thinking.
MURTAUGH=>Very thin.
RIGGS=>Probably nothing.
MURTAUGH=>Hey.
MURTAUGH=>You're on fire.
RIGGS=>Shit.
RIGGS=>Probably nothing.
MURTAUGH=>Thin. Very thin.
MURTAUGH=>Ho. Jesus.
ATTENDANT=>We're hoping to find some teeth. in there. Otherwise, could be anybody. Black, white ... Could be a fuckin' bowl of soup, for all we --
MURTAUGH=>Okay, okay.
MURTAUGH=>Bye-bye, Dixie.
MURTAUGH=>What'cha got?
RIGGS=>Part of the device. Holy cow.
MURTAUGH=>What?
RIGGS=>Artwork. This is goddamn artwork.
MURTAUGH=>Swell. I'm glad you liked it.
RIGGS=>You don't understand. This is real pro stuff. Haven't seen this since ... well, since the war.
MURTAUGH=>Come again?
RIGGS=>C.I.A. used to hire mercs who used this same setup. Mercury switches.
PATROL COP=>Sir, I think you'd better come with me.
COP=>Okay, here it is. The little kid says he saw someone working on the meter this morning.
MURTAUGH=>Where?
COP=>Across the street at Dixie's. He was playin' some kind of game, hidin' under the stairs. Says he saw the guy pretty good.
MURTAUGH=>Jesus. This could be a break.
RIGGS=>You kidding? The kid's six years old.
COP=>If that.
MURTAUGH=>You call the gas company?
COP=>Sure did. No one supposed to check that meter for at least another month.
MURTAUGH=>Let me handle this.
COP=>Be my guest.
RIGGS=>Wanna wear the chicken suit? I got some clown makeup.
MURTAUGH=>Stow it.
MURTAUGH=>Hi. I'm Detective Murtaugh. What's your name?
ALFRED=>Alfred.
MURTAUGH=>How old are you, Alfred?
ALFRED=>Six.
MURTAUGH=>Wow. Six. Bet you like the Gobots, huh?
MURTAUGH=>Me, I'm a G.I. Joe man.
ALFRED=>Is that a real gun?
MURTAUGH=>Yes, it is.
ALFRED=>Do you kill people?
MURTAUGH=>No. If a guy is hurting someone, I try to shoot him in the arm or something. Just to stop him.
ALFRED=>Momma says policeman shoot black people.
MURTAUGH=>Alfred, this man you saw. The meter man ... ? You get a good look at him?
ALFRED=>I saw him.
MURTAUGH=>Great. Listen, you ever watch 'Starsky and Hutch'? 'Cause the police, sometimes they need help. They need police helpers. Detectives. If you want, you can be a junior detective. If you want.
MURTAUGH=>Keep it, it's yours. Official detective.
MURTAUGH=>The man at the meter. Can you ... picture him in your head? Think about what he looked like. Got it ?
MURTAUGH=>I want you to draw him for me.
ALFRED=>I'm a good drawer.
MURTAUGH=>Try to draw the man.
RIGGS=>Oh, brother. This is good. I like this.
MURTAUGH=>Can it, Martin.
RIGGS=>We're gonna put out an A.P.B. on Big Bird.
MURTAUGH=>Very funny.
RIGGS=>Attention all units. Large yellow bird. Silly voice.
MURTAUGH=>You're hilarious. Alfred, draw the man, okay?
RIGGS=>Brilliant police work? I think so.
MURTAUGH=>Martin, have a look at this.
RIGGS=>Oh, my ... ... Oh, my...
MURTAUGH=>Terrific. Very professional.
ALFRED=>He laugh at my picture.
MURTAUGH=>Shhh. Don't mind him. He's crazy.
ALFRED=>I'm a good drawer.
MURTAUGH=>You bet. Alfred. This is ... the man's arm, right?
ALFRED=>Yeah.
MURTAUGH=>Okay. Now this mark. Is this ... What is this?
ALFRED=>He had it on his arm.
RIGGS=>Whoa. What was on his arm?
MURTAUGH=>Was it a birthmark? Was it like this?
ALFRED=>No. It was pained.
MURTAUGH=>Pained.
RIGGS=>Pained, pained. What's he saying?
MURTAUGH=>Sssshh. It was ... painted?
ALFRED=>Yeah.
MURTAUGH=>Like a tattoo? Do you watch Popeye? Was it a tattoo like Popeye has?
RIGGS=>This is a tattoo.
ALFRED=>It was that.
MURTAUGH=>It was that? You mean... just like that...?
ALFRED=>Yeah. Man had the same thing.
RIGGS=>You're sure?
RIGGS=>Special Forces tattoo ... ?
MURTAUGH=>Martin.
RIGGS=>Yeah.
MURTAUGH=>What the hell are we into here ... ?
MURTAUGH=>Hi, guy.
LLOYD=>Roger... What ... What's up, buddy?
MURTAUGH=>Not much. Wanna tell me about it?
LLOYD=>Tell you about what?
MURTAUGH=>Don't bullshit me. That's over. Your daughter wasn't killed because of something she was into. She was killed because of something you're into. Stop me if I'm wrong.
LLOYD=>I don't know what you're talking about. Roger, I ...
MURTAUGH=>Keep your hands in front.
LLOYD=>Hey. Take it easy, man.
MURTAUGH=>Fuck easy. When you called me the other day, you were gonna blow the whistle, weren't you?
LLOYD=>Blow the whistle on what?
MURTAUGH=>You tell me. You were gonna spill your guts. So they killed your daughter. Tell me I'm wrong.
MURTAUGH=>Talk to me.
LLOYD=>Can't ... can't do that ...
MURTAUGH=>They killed your daughter.
LLOYD=>I...
MURTAUGH=>They paid off a hooker to poison your daughter. Talk to me!
LLOYD=>Dammit, Roger, I've... ve o another daughter!
MURTAUH=>She'll be protected. It's over, pal.
LLOYD=>Protected. That's a laugh... You don't know these people.
MURTAUGH=>Acquaint me.
LLOYD=>It goes all the way back to the war.
MURTAUGH=>I'm listening.
LLOYD=>I ended up working for a group called Air America. C.I.A. front, secretly ran the entire war out of Laos. I was part of a special unit called Shadow Company. Mercs. Trained killers. When Charley was bringing in heroin to finance the V.C. government, Shadow Company went in and burned it all down. We killed everybody. But we also ... formed a plan.
MURTAUGH=>Keep talking.
LLOYD=>Couple of years ago, Shadow Company got together again. The war was over, but we still had a list of sources. In Asia.
MURTAUGH=>And ... ?
LLOYD=>And we've been bringing it in ever since.
MURTAUGH=>Bringing what in?
LLOYD=>Think real hard.
MURTAUGH=>Heroin.
LLOYD=>Two shipments a year. Run by ex-C.I.A. Soldiers, mercs. No one knows.
MURTAUGH=>You son of a bitch.
MURTAUGH=>If you were getting cold feet, why'd they kill Amanda? Why not just kill you?
LLOYD=>They can't. They need me.
MURTAUGH=>Why?
LLOYD=>My bank. It's the front. Makes everything look good on the tax report.
MURTAUGH=>The tax report ... ?
LLOYD=>This is big business, Roger.
MURTAUGH=>Not any more. I'm gonna burn it down.
LLOYD=>You can't. It's too big. These guys are trained killers.
MURTAUGH=>Tell me about the next shipment.
LLOYD=>No. No way.
MURTAUGH=>Tell me!!!
LLOYD=>Nothing ... wrong with the kids, Roger. We're all fucked up. Us old bastards ... We're killing them.
LLOYD=>Back off.
MURTAUGH=>Oh, swell. Good move.
LLOYD=>I'm not kidding. I'm in too far now.
LLOYD=>The gun is silenced, Roger.
MURTAUGH=>What's it gonna be, buddy ... ? You gonna save my life, just so you can snuff me twenty years later...?
LLOYD=>Things are different now.
MURTAUGH=>I guess.
MURTAUGH=>If you can do it, do it. I don't fucking care anymore.
LLOYD=>... What do you want to know... ?
LLOYD=>Roger -- !
MURTAUGH=>Riggs!!!
MURTAUGH=>Riggs!!!
RIGGS=>Lie down!!! Down!!!
MURTAUGH=>You through?
RIGGS=>I haven't even started.
JOSHUA=>Yes, sir ... Yes, sir, Mr. Lloyd is dead. I'm afraid, however, that another problem exists.
GENERAL=>Define.
JOSHUA=>Lloyd spoke to the cops, sir.
GENERAL=>Are the cops dead?
JOSHUA=>No, sir. I missed.
GENERAL=>That's very disappointing. The police may know everything. The whole operation, yes?
JOSHUA=>Yes. Awaiting orders, sir.
GENERAL=>Joshua, I think it's time to turn up the heat.
RIANNE=>Mark, I gotta get home.
MARK=>Would you quit worrying? Your mom thinks you're asleep and your dad's busy shooting crooks.
RIANNE=>He said he'll shoot you if we have sex.
MARK=>Some things are worth dying for.
RIANNE=>Wait.
RIGGS=>I'm pissed, Roger. Now I'm pissed.
RIGGS=>Roger. Quit looking so damn worried. I'm fine.
MURTAUGH=>Two inches higher, they would've got your head.
RIGGS=>Fuck that. Two inches to the left, they would've got my smokes.
RIGGS=>Oh, by the way: Guy who shot me?
MURTAUGH=>Yeah.
RIGGS=>Same guy who shot Lloyd.
MURTAUGH=>Jesus ... You sure?
RIGGS=>I never forget an asshole.
MURTAUGH=>So okay, ace: What do we do now?
RIGGS=>Give up? Flee? Go far away?
MURTAUGH=>Hilarious. What do we really do?
RIGGS=>What else? We bury the fuckers. You know, we solve this, we could get famous, do shaving ads and shit.
MURTAUGH=>Do goddamn Forest Lawn ads, we're not careful.
RIGGS=>Heh. Don't be a killjoy. It's Friday night. Let's go kick ass.
MURTAUGH=>You just got shot, man.
RIGGS=>Exactly.
MURTAUGH=>What do you mean, exactly?
RIGGS=>Gives us the edge, Cochise. They think I'm dead, Roger. I'm a corpse. And aren't they just gonna shit when I nail their butts ... ?
DISPATCHER=>Four King sixty, meet four king ninety on tach two.
MURTAUGH=>King sixty, roger.
PATROL COP=>Four king ninety, four king sixty. Got a homicide, Mulholland Drive.
MURTAUGH=>Four king sixty, negative. Give it to Burke.
PATROL COP=>Sorry, sixty. Captain says give it to you. Male Caucasian, age seventeen.
MURTAUGH=>Swell. Did he have blond hair and big dimples?
PATROL COP=>How'd you know... ?
MURTAUGH=>Bastards ... bastards ...
RIGGS=>Roger.
MURTAUGH=>Don't answer that!!
MURTAUGH=>Murtaugh.
MURTAUGH=>They took my kid... Bastards took my kid ...
SINGING COPS=>'Don we now our gay apparel...'
JOSHUA=>Hello, I'm calling from the K.T.L.A. News department. We heard that Sergeant ... um, Riggs, is it ... ? had some trouble tonight, and ...
JOSHUA=>My God. I'm sorry.
JOSHUA=>Goodbye.
JOSHUA=>Bingo. Riggs is out of the picture.
GENERAL=>I want Murtaugh taken alive.
JOSHUA=>He may not talk.
GENERAL=>We have his little girl. He'll talk.
MURTAUGH=>Take this. Until it's over, I don't want you to let it out of your sight. His wife nods. Runs a hand through her hair. Shifts from one foot to the other.
MURTAUGH=>They're not going to hurt her. If I do exactly what they say... they'll let her go. She's coming home.
TRISH=>What about you ... ?
RIGGS=>Hey, Missy.
CARRIE=>I can't sleep.
RIGGS=>Uh-oh. Not good.
RIGGS=>Who's your friend?
CARRIE=>Rickles the cat.
RIGGS=>Huh. He is a cutie.
CARRIE=>Ouch.
RIGGS=>Yeah. Ouch...
RIGGS=>You know they're going to kill her.
MURTAUGH=>Yes.
RIGGS=>You want her back, you've got to take her away from them.
MURTAUGH=>I know.
RIGGS=>Good. We do this my way. You shoot, you shoot to kill. Get as many as you can. Don't miss.
MURTAUGH=>I won't miss.
RIGGS=>We're gonna get bloody on this one. You're going to have to trust me.
MURTAUGH=>... How... good are you... ?
RIGGS=>What?
MURTAUGH=>Are you... only crazy ... or are you... as good as you say you are... ?
RIGGS=>No one can touch me.
MURTAUGH=>Good. Kill every fucking one of them. Okay ... ?
RIGGS=>Get half. I'll kill the other half.
RIGGS=>Here we go.
RIGGS=>Forgive me.
VOICE=>Me. Murtaugh.
RIGGS=>Come in slow.
MURTAUGH=>Hollow points. Armor piercing.
RIGGS=>You weren't followed?
MURTAUGH=>No.
MURTAUGH=>Testing, one, two, three...
RIGGS=>Fine.
RIGGS=>It's twelve-thirty. Let's move.
MURTAUGH=>Don't get too close. They'll spot you.
RIGGS=>Thousand yards okay ... ?
MURTAUGH=>Split.
MURTAUGH=>Yes. I'm alone.
MURTAUGH=>Show me the girl.
MURTAUGH=>Bullshit. Let me see her. Then I come quietly.
MURTAUGH=>Let her go now.
MURTAUGH=>Sure thing, pal...
MURTAUGH=>This fucker's alive. Let her go or we all die.
MR. JOSHUA=>Take him.
MR. JOSHUA=>He's bluffing, it's a dud. He wouldn't risk killing his daughter.
MURTAUGH=>Don't push me.
MR. JOSHUA=>Take him.
RIGGS=>Come on... Come on...
RIGGS=>Come on... Move away from the girl ...
MR. JOSHUA=>Drop the fucking grenade.
MURTAUGH=>I do and we die.
MR. JOSHUA=>No. I don't think so.
JOSHUA=>Riggs ... !
MURTAUGH=>Rianne, the car!
JOSHUA=>Dud! It's a dud!
RIGGS=>No.
GENERAL=>You're not that fast, son. Drop the rifle.
GENERAL=>I got Riggs.
JOSHUA=>A very nice try. Kendo. Get the girl.
GENERAL=>Martin Riggs. Your combat record is the stuff of legend.
RIGGS=>So is yours. General Peter McAllister, commander of Shadow Company.
GENERAL=>I see we've heard of each other.
RIGGS=>Yeah. It'll almost be a shame when I kill you.
GENERAL=>I don't think so, son.
MR. JOSHUA=>You're about to have a fun evening.
MURTAUGH=>Go spit.
JOSHUA=>Well, well. Look who's back from the dead.
JOSHUA=>Please save your strength. I believe you'll need it.
JOSHUA=>You're just in time for a lot of pain.
RIGGS=>I'm thrilled.
JOSHUA=>Oh, you will be. I daresay you'll be ... shocked.
RIGGS=>Who's the chin?
JOSHUA=>Shhh. Don't make him mad.
RIGGS=>My mistake. Who's the pleasant Oriental psychopath?
JOSHUA=>His name is Kendo, and he has forgotten more about dispensing pain than you will ever know.
RIGGS=>Terrific. Listen, guys, can we get some Mister Bubble in here ...
JOSHUA=>Please shut up. My, my, look at all those scars. See, Martin, we have a problem. Since we have Murtaugh, we really don't even need you. But I believe in being thorough.
JOSHUA=>Our problem -- and yours, too is that we have some merchandise to deliver. A rather large shipment, we're all very excited. It would be unfortunate, however, if we showed up with the goods and found ourselves surrounded by fifty cops.
RIGGS=>That would be a shame.
JOSHUA=>Indeed. So you see, Martin, it is essential that we find out how much the police know.
RIGGS=>We don't know shit. You killed Lloyd before he could talk.
JOSHUA=>I wish I could believe you. Unfortunately, I don't. So, if you'll be kind enough to tell us all you know, I will kill you quickly.
RIGGS=>Such a deal, I should worry.
JOSHUA=>Oh, indeed you should. See, Martin, you ------- talk to us ...
JOSHUA=>Do you vomit?
RIGGS=>Sometimes.
JOSHUA=>Back before prison reform, the staff at Sing Sing invented a rather unusual form of punishment. It's know as the hummingbird treatment. Are you familiar?
RIGGS=>Please, no tickling. I hate tickling.
JOSHUA=>The 'patient' is chained naked in a bathtub full of water. A bath is then administered using a battery powered sponge. The pain is said to be so excruciating that after twenty minutes most men are either insane or dead.
JOSHUA=>I thought you'd like it. I can of course, kill you now. Simply tell me what you know.
RIGGS=>Guess we're in for a long night. 'Cause I don't know scratch.
JOSHUA=>We'll find out. Kendo ... ?
JOSHUA=>Feel free to scream.
RIGGS=>Haven't you guys... heard of yuletide cheer... ?
JOSHUA=>My goodness. Now that was fun, wasn't it?
RIGGS=>I'm going to kill both of you.
JOSHUA=>That's very funny. About the shipment ... ?
RIGGS=>Fuck yourself.
GENERAL=>The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh?
MURTAUGH=>Go spit.
GENERAL=>I hope you enjoy saying that as much as Mr. Larch enjoys punishing you for it.
MURTAUGH=>That's it ... if you guys think I'm sending you a Christmas card you're nuts.
GENERAL=>This is going nowhere. Mr. Larch ... ?
KENDO=>He knows shit. We're safe.
JOSHUA=>You're sure?
KENDO=>Believe me, he'd have told us.
JOSHUA=>Fine. Big, bad soldier ... my ass. I'm going upstairs. Deal with him.
KENDO=>Deal with him?
JOSHUA=>Yeah. Fry his nuts.
GENERAL=>Anytime, Roger. Anytime. See, the thing of it is ... We know where you live. In fact, Mr. Joshua has been known to exterminate entire families, when he gets in... one of his moods. Oh, speaking of that --
RIANNE=>Daddy ... please don't let them hurt me ... !
MURTAUGH=>Bastards ... Untie me and I'll kill every one of you.
GENERAL=>Precisely why we would never think of untying you.
GENEPAL=>If you know something, son, you better play ball, 'cause the stakes just went up ...
RIGGS=>No ... Please ...
KENDO=>You die now, Sergeant Riggs. Very slow.
GENERAL=>Good Lord. Very wholesome- looking girl. Yessirreee.
MURTAUGH=>Goddammit, I've told you everything!!!!
GENERAL=>We'll soon know, won't we?
MURTAUGH=>You touch her, you're dead.
GENERAL=>Oh, son, spare me. It's over, Sergeant. No heroes around to save you ...
GENERAL=>Mr. Larch... She's yours.
RIGGS=>Work your circulation.
RIGGS=>Ssshhh- No time. Come on.
RIGGS=>They're all dead. Let's get out of here.
MURTAUGH=>Get her out of here.
MURTAUGH=>Out of the way. Move.
RIGGS=>Get an ambulance!!
JOSHUA=>Okay, you bastard, let's see who's better.
ORDERLY=>Where is he, Officer?
COP=>Right over there.
MURTAUGH=>No way you live. No way.
MURTAUGH=>Well, shit.
RIGGS=>Try not to breathe, you'll see pink elephants.
MURTAUGH=>Joshua?
RIGGS=>Got away.
MURTAUGH=>We ... gotta find him.
RIGGS=>No dice. First thing we gotta do is get you to a hospital.
MURTAUGH=>Uh-huh First thing we gotta do is check on my house. I got a bad feeling...
POLICE OFFICER=>Excuse me, sir, may I see some ID?
RIGGS=>Ho, ho, ho.
MURTAUGH=>Freeze, Joshua.
RIGGS=>I'll handle it.
RIGGS=>Come on, ace. Try me.
JOSHUA=>Don't mind if I do.
JOSHUA=>Concentrate, Martin... Don't give me an opening... Wouldn't want to do that ...
RIGGS=>No. Roger. No way.
JOSHUA=>That's it, Martin... your body wants to go into shock... but you won't let it, will you ... ?
RIGGS=>... Give it up ... Your breathing's shot ...
JOSHUA=>so's your left arm...
RIGGS=>Life's tough that way ... Oh, by the way: Fuck you.
MURTAUGH=>No guns. Let it go! Goddammit, let it go!!
MURTAUGH=>Martin.
RIGGS=>Yeah.
MURTAUGH=>the motherfucker.
RIGGS=>Last chance. Walk away.
JOSHUA=>Fuck yourself.
RIGGS=>Fine. Die.
RIGGS=>You lose.
MURTAUGH=>Take it easy, Martin...
RIGGS=>... Right. Easy. You bet ...
MURTAUGH=>Does it hurt ... ?
RIGGS=>What are you, an idiot?
MURTAUGH=>Sorry.
RIGGS=>S'all right. I got good news and bad news.
MURTAUGH=>What's the good news?
RIGGS=>... Good news is, I'm not dead...
MURTAUGH=>What's the bad news?
RIGGS=>... Bad news is, I'm still alive ...
MURTAUGH=>So.
RIGGS=>So.
MURTAUGH=>There are worse things than a psych pension.
RIGGS=>Probably.
MURTAUGH=>Guess I won't be seeing you around.
RIGGS=>Guess not. The Department thinks I'm wild. I don't belong anymore. Not here.
MURTAUGH=>Where do you belong?
RIGGS=>Who knows ... ? Maybe I can get a job on a remake of Cobra.
MURTAUGH=>My son would come see you.
RIGGS=>He'd be the only one.
MURTAUGH=>Riggs.
RIGGS=>Yeah.
MURTAUGH=>This ... is a bad old world, isn't it?
RIGGS=>Yeah. Sometimes it really is.
MURTAUGH=>Hell. I'm thinking of quitting.
RIGGS=>Don't you dare.
RIGGS=>You're too old to change now, Colchise.
MURTAUGH=>Me? Old... ?
RIGGS=>You just hang in there.
MURTAUGH=>Yeah. You, too.
RIGGS=>Guess I'll say goodbye.
MURTAUGH=>Sure. Come over for dinner sometime.
RIGGS=>No, thanks.
MURTAUGH=>Don't blame you. I'm thinking of arresting my wife for cruelty to bacon. Merry Christmas, Martin.
RIGGS=>Merry Christmas.
PUNK=>Hey, old man, got any money?
MURTAUGH=>I'm fifty. That's not old, dickless.
RIGGS=>Merry Christmas. I love you.
RIANNE=>Hi.
RIGGS=>Hi.
RIGGS=>Give that to your dad. It's a present. Tell him I won't be needing them anymore.
RIANNE=>Okay. You wanna come in? We're building.
RIGGS=>No, that's okay. You have a Merry Christmas, Missy.
RIANNE=>Okay.
RIANNE=>They say you're the best.
RIANNE=>Are you?
RIGGS=>No one can touch me.
MURTAUGH=>Sucker, if you think I'm gonna cat the world's lousiest Christmas turkey all by my lonesome, you're nuts.
RIGGS=>I think your daughter kinda likes me.
MURTAUGH=>You touch her, I'll kill you.
RIGGS=>You'll try.
