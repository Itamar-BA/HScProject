SISTER CATHLEEN=>And I’m sure a lot of people could probably never understand it. Never understand why someone so young, with their whole life in front of them, would want to give it all away to God.
LOCAL PRIEST=>Blessed be God and the Father...
CATHLEEN=>Huh? What do you mean?
SISTER MARGARET=>Telling you to be a nun...?
REVEREND MOTHER=>Put your hand down sister, postulants don’t have questions. And you are free to go home.
SISTER MARY GRACE=>So the first thing we should go over is the schedule... Postulants usually have the same schedule everyday. And really the most important thing, is you pay close attention to the bell. Because really everything we do here, all day long, all comes down to the bell...
SISTER MARY GRACE=>Mass begins once Father Luca arrives. Father always keeps his back to us the whole time, and he always reads the liturgy in Latin...
SISTER GENEVIEVE=>Excuse me Reverend Mother, sorry to bother you. But you just received another package from the Archdiocese...
REVEREND MOTHER=>May I have it please, Sister.
SISTER EMILY=>Pretty much as far back as I can remember, all I wanted was just to follow in all their footsteps...
SISTER MARY GRACE=>I’ve really been so impressed with them as a group. They all seem so excited and full of energy. So passionate about really discovering their relationships with Christ... I’d be lying if I were to say their enthusiasm didn’t make me a bit jealous.
SISTER MARY GRACE=>Really? Meaning what exactly?
SISTER CHARLOTTE=>I started thinking about her.
SISTER CATHLEEN=>Mom, please.... You promised.
SISTER CATHLEEN=>Anyway, how have you been?
REVEREND MOTHER=>Of course, I understand the historic nature... Right.... Peace be with you.
REVEREND MOTHER=>Now and forever. God bless...
SISTER SISSY=>I’m... I’m Sister Sissy.
SISTER MARY GRACE=>Questioning you?.... No, I...
SISTER MARY GRACE=>To serve God in the best way possible, with the most dignity... I know it may not seem like it, but she does care.
REVEREND MOTHER=>So each week we’ll be meeting in this room for an exercise called, ‘Chapter of Faults’. I myself will also always be here with you during every ‘Chapter’... And one thing I can assure you, we don’t ever leave this room until the Chapter is finished.
REVEREND MOTHER=>Leaving clothes on the floor. Lack of concentration, or ‘spacing out’ as you call it- While I agree these are all points of weakness in you- As far as faults go, they’re also quite superficial, and not going to get us very far in this process.... Let’s start again and this time I want you to fully examine your conscience, tell us everything you do on a daily basis to fail our Lord Christ.
REVEREND MOTHER=>Someone please speak, we’ve already established she’s not perfect.
SISTER CATHLEEN=>But, I don’t think about it.
ARCHBISHOP=>Do you know why I’m here?
REVEREND MOTHER=>I’m not a woman, I’m a nun.
SISTER EMANUEL=>Are you hungry? Maybe you should eat something.... They asked me to bring you soup from the dining hall. Hold on...
REVEREND MOTHER=>Meetings which have been principally concerned with the current state of our church. And with... certain revisions the Pope and others felt necessary, in order to insure the survival of the church ...
REVEREND MOTHER=>“From now on, please be advised that Priests are no longer required to read the liturgy in Latin, and should face the congregation during Holy Mass.... All Catholics are further encouraged to embrace the idea of full and complete religious tolerance. While we may not share the same beliefs as others, we will honor and respect each and every individual’s belief as their own, not persecute others on the basis of their beliefs ... Please be advised also that all nuns and women religious, cloistered and non cloistered, are no longer required to wear the traditional religious habit as a symbol of their lifelong matrimony to Christ. In fact, they’re now free to wear what they want....”
REVEREND MOTHER=>Regarding the culture of more extreme abnegation and self-punishment, still prevalent in many of our communities today- Please be advised that according to the council, this is no longer understood to be the appropriate path to follow, for all those seeking greater union with Christ... It is no longer acceptable to view any acts of suffering, self-punishment, or extreme sacrifice - as an act of love, or way to gain favor with our Lord. We, as Catholics, need to learn to understand love in a different way... Finally, from here forward and in the eyes of both the church and God alike, the status of all nuns will be reduced as equal to that of any regular practicing Catholic. While the choice to enter the convent remains one’s own, this does not necessarily make nuns any more ‘beloved’ or ‘special’ in God’s eyes.
REVEREND MOTHER=>I bet you think that means I’ve lost faith in you too? Because that’s what you want. You want me to lose faith, to stop believing in you, so I’m the one who leaves you first. And then you don’t have to worry about my pain..... Well guess what, I’m not doing it... I made a commitment to you 40 years ago, and whatever else happens, even if you don’t want me anymore, even if you decide to turn your back on me and leave me forever... I’m still not losing faith... Because you’re all I have, and I need you. Everything is just so much harder to face without you... My Darling husband.
SISTER CATHLEEN=>I just want you to comfort me, that’s all. I just want you to comfort me. Please. Will you please comfort me, sister.
SISTER CATHLEEN=>Just comfort me, please comfort me. Comfort me. Comfort me. Comfort me.
REVEREND MOTHER=>Sister Cathleen, come forward please.
REVEREND MOTHER=>Cathleen, did you hear what I said? Faults - Do you have faults for us?
SISTER CATHLEEN=>I want to accuse myself of... Accuse myself of... Having feelings...
SISTER CATHLEEN=>YES, MOTHER, I DOOOOOOOOO!!!
PRIEST=>Let us begin the ceremony...
PRIEST=>Sister, what is your desire?
SISTER CATHLEEN=>I seek something more.
