TITLES AND CREDITS=>DISSOLVE TO:
TAWNY=>Hi. I'm Tawny Richards with the WMGH newsteam. We're at Camp New Horizons, where an autumn retreat called "An experiment in Sharing" is about to begin. Let's meet the owners of the camp, Herman and Lilly Miranda.
TAWNY=>Herman, tell us about this wonderfully unique program.
HERMAN=>Well, Tawny, we've brung together two specially chosen groups of teens from all over America. One group comes from upper class homes while the other comes from our low class establishments.
TAWNY=>Lilly, what do you wish to accomplish?
LILLY=>In our own little way we'd like to promote harmony, peace, love, sharing, and a better understanding between the rich and poor.
TAWNY=>That's wonderful. Let's meet the kids.
CINDY=>Hi, y'all. I'm Cindy Hammersmith from Peachtree, Georgia.
GREG=>Greg Nakashima. Westwood, California.
JAN=>Jan Hernandez. Palm View, Arizona.
PETER=>Peter Doyle. Houston Heights, Texas.
BOBBY=>Bobby Stark. Western Springs, Illinois. Home of the Western Springs Wildcats!
MARSHA=>Marsha Holland. Defiance, Ohio.
TAWNY=>And let's see who we have over here -
ARAB=>Arab. San Francisco.
TAWNY=>Do you have a last name, Arab?
ARAB=>No.
TAWNY=>Okay.
SNOWBOY=>Snowboy. Chicago.
ANITA=>Anita Burcham. Sawtelle Gap, Kentucky.
RIFF=>Riff. Detroit.
TONY=>Tony DeHerrara. East L.A.
TAWNY=>And what's your name, honey?
ANGELA=>Maria. Maria Nicastro.
TAWNY=>And where are you from, Maria?
ANGELA=>All over. Right now New York.
TAWNY=>Wonderful. What great kids.
MARCIA=>That Tony's cute.
CINDY=>He's _Mexican_.
TAWNY=>Ironically, Camp New Horizons was formerly known as Camp Rolling Hills, where last year nineteen people were brutally slain by alleged psychopath Angela Baker. Baker, known as the "Angel of Death," was also allegedly responsible for another string of grisly murders seven years ago at nearby Camp Arawak, which has since closed down.
LILLY=>But things have changed here! We're under new ownership!
LILLY=>I thought we agreed you wouldn't talk about those murders.
TAWNY=>You gotta give the people what they want. Violence sells. See you Monday morning, boys.
TAWNY=>Stop tape. We're outta here.
TAWNY=>You look a little older than the others.
ANGELA=>Massive drugs.
TAWNY=>Speaking of - do you know where I could get some coke? I need about a half a gram. It's been a shit of a day - know what I mean?
ANGELA=>I'll be right back.
ANGELA=>One of the many dangers of being a drug addict is never really knowing if the stuff is pure.
TAWNY=>This is way too much.
ANGELA=>It's a gift. You're my favorite newscaster.
TAWNY=>Good stuff?
ANGELA=>It'll really clean your pipes.
TAWNY=>Happy camping!
ANGELA=>Thanks. Have a good life.
ANGELA=>What's left of it.
TAWNY=>Ready or not, here I come!
HERMAN=>It's just a firecracker. You city brats should be used to things like that!
MARCIA=>Can I sit here?
TONY=>It's not my table.
BOBBY=>Hi! Bobby Stark. Mind if I sit with you?
ARAB=>Drop dead, fag.
BOBBY=>Hi! Bobby Stark.
BOBBY=>This seat taken?
BOBBY=>Cool, man. No sweat, man.
BOBBY=>Hi. Bobby Stark. Want some company?
ANGELA=>Sure.
BOBBY=>Your name's Maria Nicastro, right?
ANGELA=>How'd you remember?
BOBBY=>I'm great with names. That's how I got to be Senior Class President of my high school!
ANGELA=>That's nice.
BOBBY=>So you're underprivileged, huh?
LILLY=>Okay, everybody! It's time to get started!
LILLY=>Do you think you could turn that off?
LILLY=>Please?
LILLY=>Thanks. Herman's going to hand out camp t-shirts for everyone to wear. That way we'll all look the same and we won't feel different.
LILLY=>As soon as out third counselor arrives, we'll be splitting up into three groups. Then we'll stay in the groups for three days. During that time each group will be camping out in the woods. And we'll get to know and understan each other as best we can.
CINDY=>Excuse me!
LILLY=>Yes, Cindy?
CINDY=>What do y'all mean by campin' out?
LILLY=>You know. Sleeping in tents, cooking our own food, hiking -
CINDY=>Where do we go to the bathroom and take showers?
LILLY=>There's outdoor toilets near our camping sites. And we'll be washing up in the lake.
CINDY=>You're kiddin.'
HERMAN=>No. We ain't.
RIFF=>What kinda food we gonna have?
LILLY=>Fish, mostly. We'll be catching them.
LILLY=>Fish are good for you. Besides,
SNOWBOY=>Yeah. Do the guys get to sleep with the girls?
LILLY=>No.
SNOWBOY=>Why not?
LILLY=>Because. You know.
SNOWBOY=>No. I don't. Tell me.
ARAB=>They're afraid we'll _fuck_.
LILLY=>Why don't we all loosen up with a good, old fashioned camp song. Does anyone know "The Happy Camper" song?
ANGELA=>I do!
LILLY=>That must be Barney.
ARAB=>_Barney_?
TONY=>Barney Rubble.
LILLY=>Everybody - I'd like you to meet our third counselor, Officer Barney Whitmore.
CINDY=>Are you a cop?
BARNEY=>Yep.
BARNEY=>Sorry I'm late. I guess I'll have to catch up on all your names later.
BARNEY=>That's one of the reasons I'm here. To make sure there's no trouble.
TONY=>Hey. You got a problem?
RIFF=>Suck my dick, spic.
RIFF=>You're dead, spic.
BARNEY=>Any more shit like this and I'll send your butt to jail so fast you won't know what happened. You got it?
BARNEY=>Anybody else carrying anything? Give it to me now. Cause the same goes for you that goes for him. Sit down and behave yourself.
BOBBY=>This is better than t.v.!
LILLY=>Hurry up, girls! We've got a lot to do!
ARAB=>Gimme a shirt, will ya?
ARAB=>How do ya get _that_ thing off? With a can opener?
MARSHA=>Hey - look at this.
MARSHA=>How weird. It's that girl who killed everybody. Angela Baker.
CINDY=>Yuck! These drawings are so gross!
ANITA (O.S.=>They should've told us about this.
ARAB=>You think anybody could come here if they did? Shit, you're dumber than you look.
ARAB=>How much did they charge _you_ to come here, rich girl?
CINDY=>I dunno. Three thousand bucks I think.
ARAB=>God. I bet the fucking government paid 'em at least that much for us. "An experiment in Sharing," my ass. We're here cause they can't get anybody else.
ARAB=>And we've got some crazy asshole named Angela Baker to thank for it.
BARNEY=>Hold it. I need to see some i.d.
BARNEY=>No offense, but you look like you've been through a lot in 17 years.
ANGELA=>I have.
ANGELA=>Thanks.
BARNEY=>I hope you have a good time here, Maria.
LILLY=>Here's your map.
LILLY=>Now pay attention! When you hear your name, go stand next to your counselor.
LILLY=>Arab, Bobby, Riff and Cindy will be with me.
LILLY=>Peter, Jan, Maria and Snowboy will be with Herman.
LILLY=>Maria -
LILLY=>That leaves Marsha, Tony, Anita and Greg with Barney.
LILLY=>I hope everybody learns a lot in the next three days. And when we come back together, I gaurantee it won't be the same.
BARNEY=>Here we are.
GREG=>Home sweet home!
BARNEY=>Why don't we put everything down and rest a second.
MARSHA=>I thought we'd never make it.
ANITA=>It wasn't so bad. Back home we've got hills like this all over.
GREG=>So do we. The Hollywood Hills. Right, Tony?
TONY=>I guess.
BARNEY=>Who's hungry?
BARNEY=>We're supposed to catch fish. And we will - maybe tommorow. But I thought you might enjoy something else tonight.
BARNEY=>I know I'm bending the rules a bit, but hey -
TONY=>You can do it. You're a cop.
BARNEY=>I'm doing it because when I had the chance to do it with my own son, I didn't.
GREG=>How old is he?
BARNEY=>Sean would have been seventeen. he was murdered here last year.
GREG=>God. I'm sorry.
BARNEY=>You didn't know.
TONY=>And I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.
BARNEY=>It's okay. I'm used to it. I'm a cop, remember?
BARNEY=>Who wants a soda?
HERMAN=>Where'd you learn to chop wood?
ANGELA=>I've never chopped wood before. But I've chopped other things.
JAN=>Let me know when you want these sticks, Mr. Miranda.
HERMAN=>Anytime now, sweatpea.
HERMAN=>And call me Herman.
HERMAN=>Where's Snowboy?
PETER=>I dunno.
HERMAN=>Snowboy!
HERMAN=>Time to go fishing!
JAN=>Do we have to?
HERMAN=>We gotta eat, don't we?
JAN=>I hate fish.
HERMAN=>Hey, that's no way to talk.
HERMAN=>You guys each grab a pole and some bait. I'll meet you at the lake in a few minutes.
HERMAN=>Come out, sweetpea. Daddy won't make you fish if you don't wanna.
ANGELA=>Here.
ANGELA=>You'll get used to it. After a while, it's kinda fun.
SNOWBOY=>Trip out.
ANGELA=>Herman should've been here by now. What's taking him so long?
SNOWBOY=>He's tryin' to get into that rich skank's pants.
ANGELA=>That's disgusting.
SNOWBOY=>I wouldn't mind havin' a piece of her myself.
ANGELA=>DON'T -
SNOWBOY=>Hey, dude. Lemme try.
JAN=>We've got company.
HERMAN=>Oh, shit.
HERMAN=>Hey, Maria - we can work something out can't we? My old lady just don't give it to me no more. You understand, don'tcha?
ANGELA=>Ready for a weenie roast?
ANGELA=>Put on a bra.
ANGELA=>You have a lousy sense of direction.
ANGELA=>Not for a long time. But before he left he said we should go to bed early. We've got a big day tomorrow.
ANGELA=>You brat.
ANGELA=>Snowboy! I need help.
SNOWBOY=>I'm busy.
ANGELA=>Doing what?
SNOWBOY=>Makin' art.
SNOWBOY=>And trip out on this -
PETER=>Bombs away!
PETER=>I warned you.
SNOWBOY PARTY ALL NIGHT! TEENAGE=>WASTELAND!
ANGELA=>Why'd I think this year would be any different?
ANITA=>This is one of the best burgers I ever ate!
BARNEY=>So's mine. Thanks for cooking, Tony.
TONY=>No problem.
MARSHA=>Excuse me a second. I've got to use the outhouse. And it has nothing to do with you burgers!
BARNEY=>Tony, go with her.
MARSHA=>I'll be all right.
BARNEY=>Maybe so. But I don't want you to go alone.
GREG=>I wanna go.
BARNEY=>Sorry. You get to start pitching the tents.
MARSHA=>That's so awful about Barney's son.
TONY=>God. I know.
MARSHA=>I never would have come here if I knew about all this. Would you?
TONY=>Probably not. But I'm glad I'm out of L.A.
TONY=>You hear that?
MARSHA=>What?
MARSHA=>No.
TONY=>Something in the woods.
TONY=>Give me the flashlight.
TONY=>Who's out there?
TONY=>Who is it? What do you want?
TONY=>Stop it!
ANGELA=>It's a good thing you're dead. In a couple of years, your breasts would've been sagging something terrible.
ANGELA=>Didn't anyone teach you that there's nothing "cool" about explosives?
SNOWBOY=>Hey, dude -
ANGELA=>Hey dude. Rad spraypaint. Mind if I try?
LILLY=>What are you doing here?
ANGELA=>I'm supposed to switch with someone from this group. Herman said so.
LILLY=>I wish he wouldn't do things like that.
ARAB=>So who's the lucky shithead you're supposed to switch with?
ANGELA=>You.
ARAB=>How old are you, anyway?
ANGELA=>Seventeen.
ACTION=>You look older.
ANGELA=>I know. When I was young, our town's water supply didn't have any fluoride.
ARAB=>You're one weird motherfucker.
ARAB=>Where's the other tent?
ANGELA=>It got sort of wrecked. We're all in one now.
ARAB=>All right!
ANGELA=>In fact, I think they're in there now.
ARAB=>Anybody home?
ARAB=>They're not here.
ARAB=>You bitch. That hurt!
ARAB=>Don't you ever -
LILLY=>Maria! Come join us!
LILLY=>I call this our "Sharing and Caring" time. For instance, what's your favorite movie?
ANGELA=>"E.T.".
LILLY=>How nice. How about- you, Riff?
RIFF=>Ones with tits and blood.
CINDY=>Why do we have to listen to those stupid rap tapes? I mean, who likes that stuff anymore?
RIFF=>Fuck you.
LILLY=>Now, Riff -
RIFF=>Rap is a helluva lot better than that country shit.
CINDY=>I never said I liked country. But I'd rather listen to that than a bunch of darkies who can't sing.
LILLY=>Riff!
CINDY=>You dirty nigger.
LILLY=>Riff! Stop it! Stop it right now or I'll get Officer Whitmore!
LILLY=>So, Maria, what's your favorite color?
MARSHA=>I think Tony scared the raccoon half to death! Come on. Scream again! I want to hear it!
TONY=>Barney, this rich white girl keeps giving me a hard timel
BARNEY=>Oh, poor babyl
BARNEY=>Nobody knows. There's no pictures of her since 7 years ago. Plus when she was 18 her juvenile records were destroyed. All we can go on are descriptions.
GREG=>But she was a counselor here last year. Didn't anyone take her picture?
BARNEY=>Nope. Supposedly nobody wanted to. She wasn't very popular.
MARSHA=>What does she look like?
BARNEY=>She's white. About 5 foot 7, 115 pounds. Brown eyes. Reddish brown hair. Twenty-one years old.
TONY=>What would you do if you saw her?
BARNEY=>I'd kill her.
LILLY=>All right, everyone. Let's put our differences aside and try to move on,
BOBBY=>Looks like we're partners.
RIFF=>Shut up.
BOBBY=>Cool, man. Right on.
LILLY=>One of you will be blindfolded and have your hands tied behind your back. Your partner will then lead you around. After fifteen minutes or so, you'll switch.
CINDY=>Oh, this'll be fun. You can go first.
CINDY=>How you doin', honey?
ANGELA=>Okay.
CINDY=>Good. I wish I could say the same. That nigger could've killed me.
CINDY=>I bet he would've liked that, too. He could brag to all his "homeboys" how he massacred some rich white girl. Those street
CINDY=>Be a good girl, and just stay there a second. I'll be right back.
ANGELA=>Hey -
CINDY=>What's wrong?
ANGELA=>Something was crawling on me!
CINDY=>I don't see anything.
ANGELA=>Get this blindfold off!
CINDY=>Honey, I'm sure it was nothin.' You city kids have just gotta get used to the country.
ANGELA=>Your turn.
CINDY=>Where are we?
ANGELA=>It's a surprise.
CINDY=>Well, I'm gettin' tired. And my feet hurt.
ANGELA=>I thought you country girls were used to this kind of stuff.
CINDY=>Hah. Hah.
ANGELA=>Are you a cheerleAder?
CINDY=>Yes.
CINDY=>No!
ANGELA=>Figures. Are you a virgin?
ANGELA=>Do you take drugs?
CINDY=>Doesn't everybody?
ANGELA=>Strike three.
CINDY=>It's about time we stopped. Take this stuff off me right now.
CINDY=>Did you hear me?
CINDY=>Oh, I get it. You're leavin' me now.
CINDY=>Help! Somethin's on Me!
CINDY=>Hey -
CINDY=>WHAT'S GOIN' ON? LET ME DOWN!
CINDY=>STOP IT!! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME??!
ANGELA=>Because you're a cheerleader, a fornicator, a drug-taker, and a nasty, snotty bigot. Besides that, you're real nice.
LILLY=>Where's Cindy?
ANGELA=>At the main camp. She's got a headache.
LILLY=>Why don't you be a dear and get her? While you're at it, grab that sack of garbage by my tent. There's a place to dump it behind the dining hall.
LILLY=>Oh - I'm just about out of tanning lotion. There's some in the pantry right next to the kitchen. The front door should be open.
ANGELA=>Did there used to be a cabin up here?
LILLY=>Yes. Right over there.
ANGELA=>Was that the cabin where all those bodies were found last year?
LILLY=>How'd you know about that?
ANGELA=>I guess I read about it.
LILLY=>Well, don't tell the others. They could get spooked.
LILLY=>And hurry back. It's almost time for lunch.
ANGELA=>Good morning, Campers!
CAMPERS=>Good morning, Angela!
ANGELA=>It's a wonderful day to be alive, isn't it?!
CAMPERS=>YES!
ANGELA AND CAMPERS=>Oh, I'm a Happy Camper! I love the summer sun, I love the trees and forests, I'm always having fun!
ANGELA=>As some of you know, I've gone through a lot of hard times in my life. I've been picked on.
ANGELA=>But that's what so terrific about places like this. We can learn to love one another.
ANGELA=>Thanks for being such great kids. You've made this camp so much fun. I love you all.
ANGELA=>You like me! You really, really like me!
LILLY=>Thanks, dear. Is Cindy coming?
ANGELA=>No. She's resting awhile in one of the cabins.
LILLY=>She's not supposed to. But, what can you do? Ready for another trust game?
ANGELA=>I thought it was time to eat.
LILLY=>It almost is. Bobby, come over here, dear!
LILLY=>I want you two to stand next to each other, side by side.
LILLY=>I'm going to be tying you two together. You'll have to coordinate your walking, your hand movements, everything.
LILLY=>Riff, since Cindy isn't feeling well, I think you and I will have to be partners.
RIFF=>No fucken way.
ANGELA=>How long do we have to do this?
LILLY=>Until you've caught enough fish for lunch and dinner. It'll test how well you can work together.
ANGELA=>But what about that steak you were cooking?
LILLY=>That was mine. I'm allergic' to fish.
BOBBY=>You're good at that.
ANGELA=>That's what everybody says. Okay, cast.
ANGELA=>Why'd you come here?
BOBBY=>It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Plus it looks great on my resume.
BOBBY=>Could you hold this a minute?
BOBBY=>You know something, Maria?
ANGELA=>Sure.
ANGELA=>What?
ANGELA=>Thanks.
BOBBY=>I think you're nice.
BOBBY=>Do you think I'm nice?
ANGELA=>Yeah. I guess.
BOBBY=>Good.
BOBBY=>Do you want to know something else?
ANGELA=>What?
BOBBY=>I like being tied up. Especially next to you. It turns me on.
BOBBY=>But I thought you wanted it. Your type always do.
ANGELA=>STOP IT!
ANGELA=>No!
ANGELA=>At least not now.
ANGELA=>Meet me by the dining hall right after dark.
BOBBY=>But how will we get away from Lilly?
ANGELA=>Don't worry. I'll handle it.
LILLY=>Good job! Why don't you put them down?
LILLY=>Riff! Since Maria and Bobby caught the fish, I think you should clean them.
LILLY=>Bobby, maybe you should clean them.
BOBBY=>But that's not fair. He doesn't do anything.
ANGELA=>Let me talk to him.
ANGELA=>Hi.
ANGELA=>We just spent two hours catching fish. It's only fair that you clean them.
ANGELA=>Please turn that down.
RIFF=>What?
RIFF=>What?
ANGELA=>You heard me the first time!
ANGELA=>Clean the fish, Bobby.
MARSHA=>This is easy. Make it harder.
TONY=>Okay.
MARSHA=>It's your turn.
TONY=>Huh uh.
MARSHA=>I'll tell!
MARSHA=>Stop it! I'm getting dizzy!
TONY=>Geez. I'm scared.
TONY=>So what's it like where you live?
TONY=>No. Don't tell me. You go to a little red brick school. And you're in the choir.
MARSHA=>It's orange brick. And I'm in the band.
TONY=>Same difference. You've got really nice parents. And your town has a park where every Fourth of July there's fireworks. Plus at Christmas there's a big parade when Santa Claus arrives. Am I right?
MARSHA=>Don't make fun of me!
TONY=>And what have you been doing to me this whole weekend?
MARSHA=>Are you in a gang?
TONY=>Yeah. Where I'm from, everybody is.
MARSHA=>What's it like?
TONY=>You don't want to hear about it. I wish I could get out. But the only way to do that is to move.
MARSHA=>Why don't you?
TONY=>Maybe I will. I'll come live with you. In Idaho.
MARSHA=>Ohio.
TONY AND MARSHA=>Same difference.
TONY=>Are you scared of me?
MARSHA=>No. But I was.
TONY=>You're very pretty.
MARSHA=>Thanks.
TONY=>Can I kiss you?
TONY=>What's wrong?
MARSHA=>Nothing.
MARSHA=>If we're gonna make love, you've gotta wear one of these.
TONY=>I'm moving to Ohio!
ANGELA=>Lilly- Let's do the blindfold game together.
ANGELA=>Please? I'll lead you back to camp. That way you can check up on Cindy.
LILLY=>Why not? I was getting a little worried about her anyway. Let me get a couple strips of cloth.
ANGELA=>I've got some.
ANGELA=>Are you planning a trip soon?
LILLY=>Yes. Herman and I are going to Europe. It'll be very expensive, but like Herman says, "we're worth it."
ANGELA=>You have cockroaches in the pantry. And I think I saw a mouse.
LILLY=>Really? We'll have to do something about that.
ANGELA=>Why do you bury your trash?
LILLY=>Because garbage companies charge an arm and a leg.
ANGELA=>They're not that expensive.
LILLY=>Every penny counts. It hasn't been easy taking this place over, let me tell you. Nobody wants to go to a camp where everyone's been slaughtered.
ANGELA=>Have you ordered your tickets to Europe yet?
LILLY=>No.
ANGELA=>Good. Your trip's been canceled.
LILLY=>WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET ME OUT OF HERE! THERE'S RATS DOWN HERE! THEY'LL EAT ME ALIVE!
ANGELA=>No they won't. They'll be suffocated soon.
ANGELA=>Oh, I'm a Happy Camper! I love the summer sun, I love the trees and forests, I'm always having fun! Oh, I'm a Happy Camper! I love the clear blue sky, And with the Grace of God, I'll camp until I die!
ANGELA=>Goodbye, Lilly.
ANGELA=>By the way, your husband fools around.
LILLY=>you can't leave me here! Come back! You're in big trouble
LILLY=>You little shit! Come back here
LILLY=>Did you hear me? GET ME OUT OF HERE!
LILLY=>NO!!!!!
BOBBY=>Guess who?
ANGELA=>Bobby.
BOBBY=>Yeah. How'd you know?
ANGELA=>Stand in front of the tree.
ANGELA=>So you like to be tied up, huh?
ANGELA=>My lips are sealed. Put your hands behind the tree.
BOBBY=>Shouldn't I take my clothes off first?
ANGELA=>No. It's more fun like this.
BOBBY=>Wow. This is like something in a dirty magazine. Wouldn't that be cool? Reading about this?
ANGELA=>It's more fun to live it.
BOBBY=>Yeah.
BOBBY=>I really appreciate this. It's not like I don't respect you or anything. I do. I think you're really a neat person.
BOBBY=>When do we screw?
BOBBY=>Whaddya doing?
ANGELA=>Thank the Lord there will be one less idiot in politics.
BOBBY=>Hey -
BOBBY=>NO!!!!!
RIFF=>What?
RIFF=>Fuckheads! I'll get you!
TONY=>Hello.
BARNEY=>Can we do something for you?
ANGELA=>Yeah. Herman wants me to be in this group. I'm supposed to switch. With Marsha.
MARSHA=>Our group was so good, too.
BARNEY=>Maybe, if I talk with Herman, you can stay. But it's not my camp, so we've got to do what he wants. Besides, we're all getting together tomorrow anyway.
MARSHA=>I know. But even so. Tonight was going to be special.
BARNEY=>With us? Or with Tony?
MARSHA=>Maria, look out -
MARSHA=>Are you all right?
ANGELA=>It hurts.
MARSHA=>What'll we do?
BARNEY=>Cut it off.
ANGELA=>NO!
BARNEY=>I'm joking.
BARNEY=>You're lucky we've got this. The first aid kit was pretty empty.
ANGELA=>What a surprise.
BARNEY=>It's not too bad. You'll just have to stay off of it as much as possible.
MARSHA=>Feel better?
ANGELA=>Yeah. Thanks a lot. I mean it.
BARNEY=>I'd better go find Herman.
ANGELA=>How well do you know him?
BARNEY=>Not very well.
ANGELA=>Good. Cause he's a terrible counselor. So's Lilly.
BARNEY=>They're not so bad.
ANGELA=>They eat steak while we eat fish. He fornicates with the campers. And Lilly's so lazy, she doesn't do anything. Just sits all day and sunbathes.
BARNEY=>How do you know?
ANGELA=>I have eyes.
BARNEY=>Did Herman really want Marsha to switch with you, or did you just make that up?
ANGELA=>I made it up. I want to be with you guys.
BARNEY=>Sorry, Maria. We've got to stick to the rules. You should get back to Herman.
ANGELA=>But I don't want to.
BARNEY=>It's only for another day. Come on. We'll help you walk there.
MARSHA=>Does Lilly really sunbathe all day?
ANGELA=>Yeah. In fact, she's out in the back right now.
MARSHA=>Really?
ANGELA=>Go look for yourself. But I'm warning you, it's not a pretty sight.
MARSHA=>Can I?
BARNEY=>Go ahead. But don't laugh in her face.
MARSHA=>I won't!
BARNEY=>What's wrong?
ANGELA=>It seems everytime I go to camp, somebody loses their head.
BARNEY=>Marsha get out of herel Run to the highway!
ANGELA=>No! Stay.
BARNEY=>GET OUT OF HERE!
ANGELA=>When you get mad you look just like your son.
BARNEY=>How many have you killed this time?
ANGELA=>I don't know. Lots. But I had no choice. They deserved it.
BARNEY=>You gonna kill me, too?
BARNEY=>So how you gonna do it? A knife? A drill? A chainsaw?
BARNEY=>Fire? Acid? or maybe you're going to boil me in water like you did that cook seven years ago. Come on, Angela. What's it gonna be?
ANGELA=>A gun.
MARSHA=>NO!
ANGELA=>We're gonna have so much fun together. Just wait.
ANGELA=>Don't make me hurt you.
TONY=>I think we should go look for them.
ANITA=>Me, too.
GREG=>But Barney told us to wait. Maybe it's some kind of a test.
TONY=>They left three hours ago, man.
ANGELA'S VOICE=>Hello.
ANGELA=>Barney wants to see all of us at the main camp. Marsha's there, too. We're supposed to play a trust game together.
GREG=>Where have you guys been?
ANGELA=>It's a long story.
TONY=>How come you don't have to be tied up?
ANGELA=>Cause Barney said so.
ANITA=>When's he getting here?
ANGELA=>I told you. Anytime now.
ANITA=>This is bullshit.
ANGELA=>Don't swear. It'll be fun.
GREG=>Says your mama.
ANGELA=>Good. All set.
ANGELA=>Here comes Barney now.
ANGELA=>I thought I saw him. Never mind.
ANGELA=>Is that him?
ANGELA=>Nope. Just my eyes playing tricks on me, I guess.
ANGELA=>Oh. There he is.
ANGELA=>Barney! Thanks for dropping in.
ANGELA=>Time to play. The object of this game is to stay alive. The rules are simple. Marsha is in one of the three cabins before you. Is she in Cabin Number One I Cabin Number Two, or Cabin Number Three? You have exactly two minutes to find out. If you try to run away, I'll kill you. if you don't find her, I'll kill you. And if you try to hurt me in anyway, I'll kill you. Any questions?
ANGELA=>Fine. Good luck!
ANGELA=>On your mark ... get set ... go!
ANGELA=>You think I'm joking?
ANGELA=>I'm dead serious. And you've just lost fifteen seconds.
TONY=>She'll kill us! Let's go!
TONY=>Marsha!
TONY=>Marsha!
ANGELA=>A minute and a half to go!
ANITA=>I can't take it! We've gotta stop!
TONY=>No!
ANGELA=>Two down. One to go. You've got forty seconds left.
TONY=>Marsha!
TONY=>Marsha!
MARSHA=>DON'T!
TONY=>NO!!!
ANGELA=>Congratulations. You made it. With seven seconds to go. You're both nice kids. If you ask me, the other two were kinda boring.
ANGELA=>I've got to be going. The phone lines have been cut. But there's a pay phone at a little store about three miles from here.
ANGELA=>I have to admit, I had a crush on you. But you and Marsha look good together. And as my aunt always said, "there's plenty of fish in the sea." Bye.
TONY=>Marsha -
TONY=>Stop it, Marsha! Stop it!
ANGELA=>You try to be nice to someone, and look what happens.
TONY=>You okay?
TONY=>You sure?

TONY=>I love you so much.
MARSHA=>Tony -

POLICEMAN=>Let's kill her. Nobody'll know.
PARAMEDIC=>I dunno...
POLICEMAN=>Come on. She doesn't deserve to live.
PARAMEDIC=>It'd be easy to do.
POLICEMAN=>It'd put a stop to all of this. It's gotta end sometime.
AMBULANCE DRIVER=>Hey! What's happening back there?
ANGELA=>Just taking care of business.
ANGELA'S VOICE=>Angels are pretty, Angels can fly, And here's an angel That can make you die. You've got no style, You've got no flair, All you do Is fight and swear. So say your prayers, And make amends, Cause your life story Is about to end.
