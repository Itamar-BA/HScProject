LENNY BRUCE=>Okay, let’s put it like this - if there was anything else in the entire world that I could possibly do to earn a living - I would. Anything. I’m talking dry cleaners to the Klan, crippled-kid portrait painter, slaughterhouse attendant... If someone said to me, Leonard - you can either eat a guy’s head or do two weeks at the Copa, I’d say pass the fucking salt. It’s a terrible, terrible job. It should not exist. Like cancer and God.
HONEY=>Sorry. I went to the Varick station instead.
