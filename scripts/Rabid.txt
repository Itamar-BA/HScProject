READ=>What've we got, Rose? Steak on a bun?
ROSE=>Tuna with lettuce and mayo. You gonna make trouble?
READ=>Yeah. Big trouble.
READ=>I want steak.
READ=>Steak.
WIFE=>We passed it.
MAN=>We didn't pass it. I remember that farm.
WIFE=>We passed it. That farm comes after concession road 12 and we were supposed to turn at concession road
KID=>I don't remember that farm, Dad.
MAN=>We didn't pass it. I very distinctly remember that farm.
WIFE=>If you would just stop this vehicle long enough to take a look at the map I will prove to you beyond any shadow of a doubt that we...
MAN=>All right!
MAN=>You're both right and I'm all wrong.
MAN=>We'll turn around and go all the way back.
MAN=>Goddamn thing! Shoulda never sold the goddamn station wagon.
KID=>The station wagon used to use too much gas, remember, Dad?
WIFE=>You keep quiet when your dad's in a sweat, Valerie.
MAN=>Goddamn thing. Shoulda never sold the wagon.
WIFE=>Oh, Christ, Bob!
MAN=>Huh? Oh, Christ!
WIFE=>Oh, my God! She's gonna burn! She's gonna die!
MAN=>Where's the kid's blanket? Where's the kid's goddamn blanket!?
JACKIE=>I don't believe it.
WALSH=>What is it? You spot a rare tufted tit-mouse or somethin'?
JACKIE=>There's a motorcycle burning in the middle of a field. I think there's somebody under it.
WALSH=>Yeah? Lemme have a look.
JACKIE=>See that column of smoke? Just follow it down to its source.
WALSH=>Wow. Lookit that!
JACKIE=>Where are you going?
WALSH=>Gonna tell the boys downstairs. It's right up their alley.
JACKIE=>Oh. Careful with my binoculars! They're very expensive!
CYPHER=>As far as I'm concerned these guys are completely legit. The bank is just as convinced as I am. They told me they're willing to go all the way with us. I'm telling you, Danny -- a franchise operation for plastic surgery resorts is one of those magnificent, inevitable ideas.
KELOID=>Banks are always quick to say that when everything's rolling easy. But you can take it from me -- first sign of heat from the medical association, first cries of professional outrage, and the bank'll call back its note and leave us hanging by our thumbs.
ROXANNE=>It's not the financing that's bothering you, Dan. Your voice has that edge to it.
KELOID=>I've never denied it. I sure as hell don't want to become the Colonel Sanders of plastic surgery.
CYPHER=>Why not? Sounds great to me.
KELOID=>I'll tell you why not. Because it's unprofessional, unmedical, and unsavory.
CYPHER=>You thought of it.
KELOID=>I was only kidding.
CYPHER=>You were not. Besides, you want me to go back and tell three of the largest investment groups in North America, 'Forget it. He was only kidding?'
KELOID=>Oh, God. It's all gotten out of hand. I can see it now: fifty enfranchised Keloid's Cosmetic Surgery Clinics flung across the face of North America like Holiday Inns. Next thing you know, Do-It-Yourself Facelift Kits.
CYPHER=>I like it. We could call it... we could call it Suture Self. No, I'm serious. I like that. There's got to be a way.
ROXANNE=>All right, boys. I think we're getting a bit silly...
STEVE=>Is Dr. Keloid there? It's urgent.
KELOID=>Yeah, what is it, Steve?
STEVE=>There's been a motorcycle accident a few minutes down the highway here. Looks like a couple of people have been hurt. Should I take the van and go get 'em?
KELOID=>Yeah, sure. Hey, wait a minute. Steve? You still there?
STEVE=>Yeah.
KELOID=>Hang on till I get there, OK? I'm coming with you. Meet you at the garage.
STEVE=>Roger.
ROXANNE=>Oh, now, Dan. We've got a lot of decisions to make...
KELOID=>You and Murray work it out, hon. Just make the pill easy for me to swallow, OK?
CYPHER=>Well, what do you think about facelift kits, Roxy? I mean, they've got abortion kits.
ROXANNE=>Let's just forget that anybody ever mentioned the idea, OK, Murray?
STEVE=>Well, we've got oxygen now, Dr. Keloid.
KELOID=>I think we're going to have to use this before we get close enough for the oxygen, Steve.
WIFE=>They're over there, Doctor! They were speeding!
MAN=>I tried to put it out. I couldn't get near it.
MAN=>There's another one over there. I saw him movin' around a minute ago.
KELOID=>Might as well go get him. We won't be ready to move her for a few minutes.
MAN=>Christ. I didn't know it was a girl. Is she dead?
KELOID=>This isn't embalming fluid I'm shooting into her. See if you can lift the machine off her. Use the blanket around your hands. It's hot.
MAN=>My God.
KELOID=>Roxanne? Yeah, listen. We're going to have to throw in everything we've got. I know, but let me tell you what we're looking at. The gas tank exploded over the girl's abdomen and I don't know what she's got left in there. The man's got a broken hand, separated shoulder, concussion, the usual. We can send him to the General. But it's definitely major surgery for her, and right now. I know we're not, but we've got no choice. I'd say she's got a half hour to live and it's three hours to the nearest serious hospital. It's us or nobody. Yeah. I hope I can remember too. Well, they say it's like riding a bicycle.
KELOID=>Get the guy in the van into observation and check him out. But take it easy -- concussion, separated shoulder, broken hand. OK, Louise? Maybe some Demerol when he becomes lucid.
LOUISE=>OK, Dr. Keloid.
JACKIE=>What a waste. She doesn't even need a nose job.
MAN=>Jesus wept! What's that all about?
WOMAN=>Somebody said something about an accident.
MAN=>Couldn't they throw a sheet over it or something? I'm starting to feel like I'm in a hospital.
KELOID=>OK, boys. Take her into pre-op and tell Dr. Karl to set her up for the works.
ROXANNE=>I don't buy it, Dan.
KELOID=>You haven't seen her.
ROXANNE=>I don't have to see her. Neutral field grafts have never been used internally. We could end up with a terminal cancer patient on our hands.
KELOID=>Aw, c'mon. We can monitor, Roxy. She's got nothing to lose. Literally. She doesn't have enough small intestine left to absorb nutrient. If we just close her up she'll have to be fed intravenously for the rest of her life, which will be a short and a dismal one. But if we graft neutral field tissue cones into the abdominal cavity, there's a chance that they'll read her condition by post-embryonic induction and develop into a new set of intestines.
ROXANNE=>Or run wild and make some very creative malignant tumors. Dan, the clinic doesn't need this. Let's play it safe.
READ=>Oh, no. Not the T-shirt. Rose gave me the T-shirt.
LOUISE=>I think you'd find it pretty painful trying to take if off the standard way.
READ=>No, look. I think I can... Ow! Oh! You're right. Cut the thing off. I'll put it up on the wall of my garage.
READ=>So when do I get to see Rose?
LOUISE=>Not for a while.
READ=>Why not?
READ=>I want to see her right now! Ow! Oh, God. I didn't kill her, did I?
LOUISE=>She's not dead.
READ=>What is that stuff? I don't want you to put me out.
LOUISE=>It's just Demerol. It'll ease the pain. All right?
READ=>Sure. Wonderful. Anything to ease the pain.
KELOID=>Now, I know everyone here is familiar with the standard techniques of skin grafting, but what we're going to do is a little out of the ordinary. I'll explain it as we go. We're removing full-thickness skin grafting material from the patient's thighs as per normal graft acquisition procedure. However, before these grafts are applied to the damaged areas of the patient's breasts, abdomen, and so on, they will be treated so that they become morphogenetically neutral. They are then called neutral field grafts.
KARL=>Can we treat the graft material here, Dr. Keloid?
KELOID=>No, Dr. Karl. The graft tissue will be frozen and sent to the Sperling Institute. We'll have to keep the patient in an operation-ready state until it comes back to us. That's going to be a bit trying for all of us, but it can't be helped.
RITA=>I don't understand the functional difference between neutral field and normal graft tissue, Doctor.
KELOID=>Well, when the thigh skin tissue is treated, Nurse Benedetto, it'll lose its specificity as both thigh tissue and skin tissue. For example, if it were grafted to a burned cheek, it wouldn't just be thigh skin with the color and texture of thigh skin -- it would actually develop as facial tissue. In other words, neutral field tissue has the same ability to form any part of the human body that the tissue of a human embryo has.
KARL=>Doctor, this patient has lost most of her absorptive intestinal mucosa. Could neutral field tissue reconstruct an organ as complex as the small intestine.
KELOID=>Yes, Dr. Karl. I think that under the right circumstances it could. I've done it myself using lab animals at the Sperling Institute.
KELOID=>Let me add that there is always a possibility that carcinomas will form when neutral field grafts are used internally. In this case, we're using a radical plastic-surgery technique to compensate for our lack of heavy medical hardware. We're doing it to save a life. It's the only trick we've got.
LOUISE=>Hi, Judy Glasberg. You back again?
JUDY=>Daddy didn't think the new nose was different enough, so I'm in for more alterations. I keep telling him it looks just like his, and he keeps saying, 'That's why I want you to change it.' I'm terrified to find out what it all means.
LOUISE=>Didn't you see the sign on the door, Mr Read? You're supposed to register with me before you come in here.
READ=>I saw it. I guess I consider myself qualified.
LOUISE=>What are you trying to do, give her pneumonia?
READ=>I'm trying to ease my guilt feelings by telling myself that Rose is getting better.
LOUISE=>I see. Is it working?
READ=>Is she getting better?
LOUISE=>You've been here often enough in the past two months to know as much as I do.
READ=>When do I get to see Dr. Keloid?
LOUISE=>You never tell me in advance when you're coming. How can I make an appointment for you?
READ=>I never know in advance when the next wave of guilt will hit me. I want to see him right now.
LOUISE=>He's in a meeting.
READ=>Tell him I forced you.
LOUISE=>All right. But please... no touching until she's conscious.
READ=>OK, Mom.
KELOID=>Well, as you've seen, Rose is still in some kind of coma, sort of half real coma, half normal deep sleep. Could be weeks before she's lucid.
READ=>You don't know for sure?
KELOID=>No. Her body is still in a state of total shock. She can't possibly be moved to a city hospital yet. Her grafts seem to be healing well. We've been monitoring the internal grafts electronically and there is definitely new tissue growth happening in the abdominal cavity. Whether this growth will mature into functioning intestinal mucosa we won't know for quite a while.
READ=>You mean if your grafts or whatever they are don't work, she'll never eat like a normal human being again. She'll have to be fed intravenously.
KELOID=>That's right. At the moment, she has only enough small intestine to digest the most basic nutrient material. See -- the longer the small intestine, the more complex the food that can be broken down and absorbed by the body as food. Cows have lots and lots of intestines so they can eat grass and other vegetable matter. We have medium-length intestines, so we can eat meat and a limited variety of vegetable matter. Vampire bats -- the real ones, I mean -- have short intestines, so they eat whole blood, which is very easy to break down and assimilate. Your girlfriend's in the same boat.
READ=>What about her brain?
KELOID=>Her helmet probably saved her from brain damage, but until she's fully conscious...
READ=>You won't know that either.
KELOID=>Hart, what can I tell you? There's no magic. Look, I've done my best. You're welcome to come here and keep your vigil by Rose's bedside any time the mood takes you, but please believe me, I will personally telephone you the instant Rose shows even the slightest signs of regaining consciousness.
WALSH=>Jeez, when I saw that thing burning, I never figured I'd be standing here talking to you a month later. How's your hand?
READ=>They're taking the cage off this afternoon. That's when I'll find out. The pin stays in my shoulder for another month, though. Doesn't seem to bother me except when it gets damp.
CYPHER=>Hi, Lloyd. How ya doin'?
WALSH=>Great.
CYPHER=>C'mon, Hart. I got a pack of hungry investors waiting for me.
CYPHER=>I hope you've got some friends who'll help you unload that pile of junk. I've got a bad back. What're you going to do with it? Use it for an ashtray?
READ=>Giving it to a friend for parts. I can hardly stand to look at it. Think I'll get back into go-karts.
WALSH=>Rosie, Rosie, sweetie, take it easy! You need that juice, sweetie. It's keeping you alive. Hey, easy, there. Easy. That's it. That's a girl.
ROSE=>Hart? What are you... what are you doing, Hart? Are we all right? Are we...
WALSH=>I'm not Hart, Rosie. Hart's back in Montreal waiting for you. I'm Lloyd. I'm a friend of yours.
ROSE=>Hart?
WALSH=>Back in Montreal. Waiting for you. He's fine. He's OK. I was just talking to him this afternoon.
ROSE=>Oh. I... I guess I was dreaming.
WALSH=>I don't think you were just dreaming. You and Hart were in a really spectacular motorcycle crash.
ROSE=>A crash? Was there fire? Was there... blood?
WALSH=>Yeah. Plenty of both. You're bleeding right now. I'd better get Dr. Keloid.
ROSE=>No! Not yet. I'm all right. But I'm freezing cold, and you're so warm. Hold me.
WALSH=>Look, I think I'd better...
ROSE=>Please hold me. I'm dying of the cold.
ROSE=>Oh, God, that feels so good.
WALSH=>Ah, look... you don't even know where you are, do you?
ROSE=>Sure I do. I'm here with you.
WALSH=>Look, this is really weird. Are you sure you know what you're... Ow!
WALSH=>Hey, I think I... I think I cut myself or something. You got something sharp in there with you? Ow! Oh, that hurts!
MISS OWEN=>Yes? Who is it?
MISS OWEN=>Oh, God save us!
WALSH=>I'm sick. I'm sick. Help me.
MISS OWEN=>Mr Walsh! What on earth has happened to you?
WALSH=>I don't know. I can't remember a thing.
KELOID=>Were you sleepwalking? Could you have fallen against something outside and then come back in without waking up?
WALSH=>I doubt it. Never done anything like that before.
KELOID=>Get me some stuffing, maybe a sponge or two as well. This wound isn't clotting at all. I think we're going to have to shoot in some coagulants to get a scab to form.
LOUISE=>Right away.
KELOID=>From what I can see, it's a very, very clean and precise wound. You haven't leaned on any picket fences, have you? Kind with those little spearheads?
WALSH=>No.
KELOID=>Does this hurt?
WALSH=>Can't feel a thing.
KELOID=>You can't?
WALSH=>My whole right side has no feeling in it. Just this aching kind of tingling.
KELOID=>Hm.
LOUISE=>Dr Keloid? Kenny Kwong would like to see you.
KELOID=>Right now?
LOUISE=>He says it's very important. He's waiting in the hall.
KELOID=>OK. Listen... our friend here may have had a stroke. I think the General's the best place for him. But before you plug him up I want 10 cc of blood drawn directly from that wound for tests. Then get Steve to drive him into the city in the ambulance. Tell him to take lots of plasma with him. We're going to have to forget about the coagulants until the General has a chance to do an ECG on him.
LOUISE=>Will do, Doctor.
KWONG=>Can you come with me, please, Dr. Keloid?
KELOID=>Sure, Kenny. What's up?
KWONG=>You told me to check around the grounds to see if I could find out how Mr. Walsh got hurt?
KWONG=>I couldn't find nothing outside. No blood, nothing. Then Nurse Rita call me. She find something. She tell me go get Dr. Keloid. You see it, then you tell us what happened.
KWONG=>Nurse Rita waiting for you in here.
RITA=>Watch your feet, Doctor. The police will probably want every little piece of glass and strip of gauze exactly the way we found it.
KELOID=>Why do you think the police would be interested in this, Rita?
RITA=>Why, it's perfectly obvious that that Walsh fellow attempted to molest the poor girl while she was still in a coma. I've seen things like that happen before. Maybe he was drunk.
KELOID=>Hm. Her grafts have taken amazing well. Probably won't even have to rebandage. Hm. I can't even see any scar tissue.
KELOID=>Wow. I'll have to have a closer look at that.
RITA=>Rejection problems?
KELOID=>Don't think so. Seems to be an extreme swelling of the lymph nodes under the arm. Could just be a local infection that's under attack, but it's quite a bump. And there's some kind of lesion there. Doesn't seen to be gangrenous, but...
KWONG=>Want me to clean up the mess now, Doctor?
KELOID=>What? Oh, yes. But save all the pieces and scrape some of the dried blood on to a slide. Maybe we'll find something out.
RITA=>But Dr. Keloid... Mr. Walsh, he may well be...
KELOID=>Rita, Lloyd Walsh wouldn't do something like that. He just wouldn't. And none of this explains how he got his wound. I think a quiet, thorough, and very private investigation is in order. Don't you?
JUDY=>Rose? Is that you? I thought everyone was asleep. They told me you were still in a coma.
ROSE=>Oh, no. I'm doing much better now, thank you.
JUDY=>It... it's really weird to meet you this way. I mean, I've never really talked to you before. But I sort of feel I know you, you've been around here for so long. And I saw them bring you in right after the accident.
ROSE=>Do you mind if I get in with you? I've been lying in bed for such a long time, my body aches all over.
JUDY=>Ah, well, I... does anybody know you're here? I mean, does Dr. Keloid know you... you've regained consciousness?
ROSE=>I don't think so. Everybody seemed to be asleep. It was a bit spooky waking up and finding myself all alone. I'm so glad I ran into you. Hey, know what? I think I can feel the warmth of your body radiating out to me through the water. I've never felt anything like that before.
JUDY=>I think I'd better get out now. I'm getting all wrinkly.
ROSE=>Oh, no. Not yet. You haven't even told me your name.
JUDY=>Judy Glasberg. Nice to meet you.
ROSE=>Mm. It's nice to meet you too.
JUDY=>Oh, now, c'mon. You're embarrassing me. Let me put some clothes on and we'll have a few drinks or something, OK?
JUDY=>Let me go, please! I want to get dressed. Listen, to tell you the truth, I think there's still something wrong with you. I think you ought to let... Ow! Oh! Something's cutting me! Oh! It hurts!
ROSE=>Oh, no! No!
VICTIM=>Hey, you can't leave yet, Lloyd. They haven't figured out how come you're bleeding all over the place.
WALSH=>Aw, it's slowed down to a trickle. No problem.
VICTIM=>How's your arm?
WALSH=>It's fine.
VICTIM=>If the night nurse comes around, I'll tell her you're in the can, how's that?
WALSH=>Terrific. Take care of yourself.
CAB DRIVER=>Hey, Mister, you wanna sleep? I can turn the radio off. It's a long way to Camelford.
CAB DRIVER=>Hey, Mister. You want me to turn the radio off? Or maybe if you want I can turn off the back speakers and just leave on the front ones...
KELOID=>Yeah. Yeah. No. No, you're kidding. Dead? Yeah. No, I would have absolutely no objections to an autopsy. It's definitely indicated. No, I've got nothing to add to my telephoned report. We never came up with anything else. Yeah. Right. OK. 'Bye.
ROXANNE=>What is it, Dan?
KELOID=>Lloyd Walsh is dead.
ROXANNE=>He's what?
KELOID=>He left the General about an hour ago. Told another patient he felt all right. He took a cab and the cab crashed on a highway. Both occupants dead.
ROXANNE=>Oh, God. Poor Lloyd. But you said something about an autopsy? Was the cab driver drinking?
KELOID=>No, it's Walsh. They're not happy with his corpse. Something about the eyes... I'm going to have to go over Walsh's file again. It just doesn't add up.
FARMER=>All right, you! Hold it right there! Oh. Whatta we got here? Hello, sweet honey pie. What're ya drinkin'? You come in to get outta the cold?
FARMER=>I got something ya can take a drink off of, an'it ain't no whisky, neither.
FARMER=>Hey, that's real nice, honey pie. You like me, don't ya? I kin tell ya do.
READ=>Hello? Rose? Is it really you? How come you're... I mean, the last time I saw you... Oh, God. Rose, are you all right?
ROSE=>Hart? Oh, Hart. No, no, I'm not all right. I'm in terrible trouble. I want you to help me.
READ=>What are you talking about? Rosie, calm down, I can hardly understand what you're saying.
ROSE=>Hart, can you hear me?
READ=>I can hear you, Rosie.
ROSE=>Hart, you've got to come and get me. You've got to come and get me as fast as you can.
READ=>Rose, don't panic. Whatever's wrong I'll be able to help you, understand? Now, I can be at the clinic first thing in the morning, OK? I'll get a lift from somebody, I'll take a cab if I have to. Rose? You still there?
ROSE=>I'm still here.
READ=>Rose, tell me what's wrong. Please. I'm going crazy here.
ROSE=>I can't talk now. See you soon.
READ=>Christ! What was the number of that place?
KELOID=>Hi, Rita. I couldn't sleep. I've been trying to figure out what there could possibly be in Walsh's blood that would cause...
RITA=>Doctor, I think you'd better come with me.
CYPHER=>Oh, no. I just don't believe it. OK, Jeffrey -- you're on your own for a second.
CYPHER=>No? You want in on the action? OK, let's go.
CYPHER=>What could you possibly want at this hour of the morning?
READ=>Murray, it's Hart Read. I hate like hell having to bother you like this, but I'm going out of my skull. It has to do with the clinic.
CYPHER=>Yeah, OK. I was up anyway with the baby. So what gives?
READ=>I got this phone call from the clinic. From Rose.
CYPHER=>From who?
READ=>From Rose. She's supposed to be in a coma. Keloid promised me he'd tell me the second she showed signs of consciousness and here I am getting a call from her at five in the morning.
CYPHER=>That is pretty weird. But maybe she came to in the middle of the night and didn't know where she was. Those things can happen. Jeffrey, don't eat the phone. You'll get indigestion.
READ=>But she said she was in trouble, Murray. She wants me to come and get her right now.
CYPHER=>Look, Hart -- she's confused and she's scared. Did you phone the clinic back and try to talk to Danny?
READ=>I did. I got to talk to a tape recorder. I left a message.
CYPHER=>OK. I'll phone Danny right now at his private number, and I'll make sure that he knows that your Rosie is making phone calls in the middle of the night. Then I'll pick you up at your place in an hour and we'll go up to the clinic together. How's that grab ya?
READ=>Great. Phone me right back if there's a problem.
CYPHER=>Absolutely.
READ=>OK, Murray. Thanks a hell of a lot.
KELOID=>Rose... I'm Dr. Keloid. Dan Keloid. I'm here to help you, sweetheart.
KELOID=>Rose, we won't talk about anything right now except how you're feeling, OK?
KELOID=>Good. First thing I want to do is to check out some of the skin grafts we did for you. Now, could you please just slip your arm out of your left shoulder strap and raise your arm over your head?
KELOID=>What's the matter, Rose? Are you in pain? Talk to me, Rose. It's the only way I can understand what's bothering you.
ROSE=>I'm hideous, Doctor. I'm crazy and I'm a monster.
KELOID=>C'mon, Rose. There's just about nothing we can't fix if we know what's wrong. Now, I don't want any more games. Do what I tell you.
KELOID=>Does that hurt?
ROSE=>No. It doesn't hurt.
KELOID=>As far as I can tell now, it'll take just a very minor operation to remove that growth from under your arm. It may be some kind of external intestinal tissue. The neutral field tissue graft we did has been trying to find a way to get food that you can digest into your body. I was hoping it would do that by providing you with a regular set of small intestines but it seems to have had something different in mind.
KELOID=>How long have you been conscious, Rose? Do you know?
ROSE=>Couple of days.
KELOID=>Do you feel weak?
ROSE=>I feel strong. I feel very strong.
KELOID=>Rita tells me you refused to let her attach you to your intravenous nutrient bottles. Why?
ROSE=>I don't need them. They make me feel sick.
KELOID=>I don't understand. They've got to be your only source of food.
ROSE=>They're not. They haven't been for a couple of days. Not since that man...
KELOID=>Man? What are you talking about?
ROSE=>I'll show you.
FARMER=>One bucket of your best for me and my dog there.
COUNTER GIRL=>Yes, sir.
COUNTER GIRL=>Yes, and will that be... Oh!
COUNTER GIRL=>Hey, Mister. Did you know you're bleeding?
FARMER=>It's nothin'.
TRUCKER=>Musta had a rough night, Buddy.
FARMER=>Think I got in a fight or somethin'. Can't remember too good.
KITCHEN MAN=>One bucket ready to go.
TRUCKER=>Hey, Buddy. I think that one's mine.
TRUCKER=>I said... I think that one's mine, Buddy.
FARMER=>I gotta eat. I gotta eat. I gotta eat...
TRUCKER=>Take those glasses off so I can see who I'm talkin' to.
TRUCKER=>What the hell...
ROXANNE=>You're sure you want to do this one, Dan? Louise and I could handle it with no trouble.
KELOID=>I'll be fine.
ROXANNE=>You were pretty groggy this morning. Cut yourself shaving?
KELOID=>I'll be fine.
NEWSCASTER=>...but there can be little doubt that the issue of police brutality will still be with us for some time to come. And speaking of brutality -- an incident of violence that took place over a Highway 11 fried chicken take-out counter ended in the death of one man and the wounding of an eighteen-year-old girl. We'll give you further details on that story as they become available.
NEWSCASTER=>The man, later identified as forty- three-year-old Fred Atkins of Camelford, went berserk this morning during an argument over who was to be served his bucket of chicken first and bit the counter girl on the arm. The man was subdued by an unidentified truck driver and the chicken place's cook, but died of unknown causes before police arrived. Local health authorities suspect that rabies might be involved and have vaccinated everyone concerned. The dead man's dog was destroyed on the spot. And now, a brief pause for station identification, after which we'll talk to a scientist who says that earthquakes may one day become a thing of the past...
CYPHER=>Hey, we're right there.
READ=>Huh?
CYPHER=>The place they were talking about on the radio. Wanna stop off for some fried chicken?
READ=>Not hungry, thanks.
ROXANNE=>Do you want me to complete the stitching, Dr. Keloid?
KELOID=>I need... I need something to cut with, Dr. Rushton.
ROXANNE=>You want the scissors now, Doctor?
KELOID=>Yes. The scissors now.
ROXANNE=>Scissors.
ROXANNE=>Dan...!
KARL=>Dan, don't be stupid! What's the matter with you? Are you crazy or something? Stop it! Stop it!
LOUISE=>I'm getting the police! I'm going to call the police!
LOUISE=>He's gone crazy, he's gone crazy! He's killing everybody! There's blood everywhere! We've got to do something! We've got to get the police!
READ=>Hey, look. What's going on there? The place is crawling with police.
CYPHER=>What? Hey, you're right.
READ=>Oh, Christ, no! It's Rose. It's got to be. Something's happened to Rose!
CYPHER=>Take it easy, Hart. They wouldn't need three cruisers for that. It's something else for sure.
CYPHER=>Where's Dr. Keloid? What's happening?
COP=>Who are you?
KARL=>Murray, thank God you're here. It's been a nightmare. This is Murray Cypher. He's one of the owners of the clinic.
CYPHER=>What's the story, Bill?
KARL=>It's Danny. He went berserk in the middle of an operation. I was there. He tried to kill Roxanne. He cut her. They had to take her away.
CYPHER=>Danny? You've got to be kidding.
READ=>Oh, God. Have you seen Rose? Has anything happened to her? Is she all right?
KARL=>Rose? You mean... no, no, this has nothing to do with her. She should be around somewhere.
COP=>OK, let's see if I've got this straight. You were in the middle of an operation, a routine facelift, did you say?
KARL=>That's right. That's what we do here. The operation was just about over... it was Dr. Keloid who was performing it, you see... This is so bizarre...
MISS OWEN=>...certainly they took her away. She was bleeding and she was completely hysterical. Couldn't make out a word she was saying.
READ=>Have you seen Rose? The young girl who was in the motorcycle accident?
MISS OWEN=>Do you mean the girl who was in here to have her nose fixed two times in a row...?
COP=>So you are in fact Dr. Keloid's business partner?
CYPHER=>I am.
COP=>Come with me, please.
KARL=>I can't, Murray. You go. I've seen it.
COP=>Couple of my men got bitten. Those rabies shots are killers. Think I'd rather take my chances on getting sick instead.
CYPHER=>Bitten? By what?
COP=>By that.
COP=>Can you confirm the identification of this man as Dr. Daniel Keloid?
CYPHER=>Oh, my God. My God.
READ=>Look... I'm trying to find my girlfriend. She's a patient here. She was here last night but nobody seems to have seen her.
SECOND COP=>We got a young girl downstairs. You wanna take a look at her?
READ=>Is her name Rose?
SECOND COP=>We don't know. We didn't ask her. C'mon. Tell the chief I'm downstairs gettin' an ID. Be back in a flash.
SECOND COP=>C'mere. Can't see anything from there.
SECOND COP=>Is that Rose?
READ=>No. No, that's not Rose.
TRUCKER=>Want this, Rose? Steak on a bun. Real good.
ROSE=>Um... wouldn't mind just one bite.
ROSE=>You're right. It's fabulous.
TRUCKER=>Last time I ever patronize that greasy spoon, I can promise you that. C'mon sweetheart. There's a girl. Get it all out.
TRUCKER=>You just put your arms around me and I'll lift you back in. We'll get you some coffee or some soup or something at the next stop, OK?
LADY=>Hi. Where are you going?
ROSE=>Montreal. Where are you going?
LADY=>Same place.
ROSE=>That's wonderful. Thanks. I was beginning to think I'd never get back home again.
OFFICER=>Something wrong?
TRUCKER=>Huh? Uh, no... nothing really wrong. I... I guess I musta dozed off. Yeah. That's it, I guess. Pulled over to have a nap.
OFFICER=>Well, that's good. We find too many of you boys taking pills to keep yourselves going all day and all night. Next time, though, try to pick a better spot to pull over. This road's kind of narrow.
TRUCKER=>Oh, yeah. Right. Will do, Officer.
OFFICER=>OK. Have a nice day.
TRUCKER=>Yeah. Thanks.
HEALTH OFFICIAL=>Claude Lapointe, Quebec Bureau of Health, official business. Sorry, boys. You can't go in unless you're willing to stay. The whole station's under quarantine. We think we've got an epidemic.
READ=>Hey, Mindy? You still there? Yeah, it's crazy here. I can hardly hear a thing. Yeah. Listen, I thought that Rose might try to get in touch with you. Yeah. She what? She called you? Oh, that's great. She's on her way over? That's incredible. You wouldn't believe what's been happening. It's crazy time. Yeah. Totally. Well, listen. When she gets there, tell her I'll be stuck in the Camelford cop shop for at least forty-eight hours. Camelford. It's a town you go through on the way to the clinic. That's right. The whole clinic was hit with rabies or something, they're not sure exactly. Yeah, the whole clinic. She might have to come in for tests or something. I'll find out. Yeah. You keep her there for me. As soon as I get out I'll come and get her. Yeah. OK, Mindy. Ciao.
DISPATCHER=>Hey, anybody here seen Eddy? He's got the lead truck and I can't find the son of a bitch. Hey, you seen Smooth Eddy?
LOADER=>I seen him climb into the box of his truck half an hour ago. He didn't look too good.
DISPATCHER=>Whaddya mean he didn't look too good? Smooth Eddy always looks good.
LOADER=>Naw, I mean he looked sick. Like, nauseous.
DISPATCHER=>What the fuck we runnin' here, a nursery?
DISPATCHER=>Eddy... Hey, Eddy, you in there?
DISPATCHER=>You in there, Eddy? We gotta get this rig movin'.
NEWSCASTER=>...and health officials have said they consider the outbreak of the new strain of rabies as being potentially 'the worst of this century.' At the police station in Camelford, Kathy Draper talked to Quebec Bureau of Health official Claude Lapointe.
LAPOINTE=>Certainly this is serious. This is not just a question of swine flu or something like that. We have already several deaths on our hands in this one small area alone, and the main problem is... we don't know what we're up against.
INTERVIEWER=>Are you saying that this is not an outbreak of rabies?
LAPOINTE=>I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that, exactly. But it must be a new strain of rabies, because there are symptoms involved which we and even the world health community do not seem to be familiar with.
INTERVIEWER=>What are these symptoms?
LAPOINTE=>Well, the period of incubation of this disease is very brief, maybe six to eight hours at the most. Now, that's quick, much quicker than normal rabies. Then the victim begins to sweat, to shake, to foam at the mouth. That's not so rare. What is rare is that the victim always with this new disease becomes violent and wants to bite somebody new. And this crazy phase is followed by a coma and then, in every case we know, by death. It's very strange.
INTERVIEWER=>What advice would you give to our viewers?
LAPOINTE=>The disease spreads through the saliva of the victim... the saliva is very contagious. It dribbles into open wounds and cuts and causes immediate infection.
INTERVIEWER=>So?
LAPOINTE=>So... don't let anybody bite you. And if somebody does, find a doctor who can give you rabies shots immediately. We are already setting up vaccination centers beginning right here and spreading out toward Montreal. If we don't keep the disease localized and out of large centers of population, well... I wouldn't like to say what it could be like.
INTERVIEWER=>I heard you mention the Black Plague of London just before we went on the air. Is that what you mean by...?
LAPOINTE=>We sometimes like to be dramatic about these things. It's more interesting than the usual paperwork and we get... you know... we get excited. It's a real challenge...
ROSE=>Surprise. I'm amongst the living.
READ=>Got anything in there I might want to read? I'm starting to go stir crazy already.
CYPHER=>It's actually pretty exciting stuff if you know how to interpret it.
READ=>I guess I'm just going on automatic pilot right now.
CYPHER=>I can't connect that creature I saw in the paddy wagon with Danny. I just can't believe they're all dead...
COP=>George, for God's sake! Can't you understand what I'm saying? Stay back! Sit on the floor and put your hands on your head.
READ=>What's going on?
COP=>Get into the cell and be ready to lock yourselves in. Do what I tell you!
VOICE=>Get out of the line of fire, Ted. We'll take him from here with the scatterguns.
COP=>Gimme a count of three, Joe! I'll be outta your way by three!
VOICE=>One...!
VOICE=>Two...!
COP=>Gimme room. I'm coming in quick.
VOICE=>Three...!
COP=>They gave him rabies shots. He got bitten up at that facelift place and they gave him his shots right away.
COP=>They didn't do him any damn good, did they?
MINDY=>What are you doing, Rose?
ROSE=>I think I have to go out for a while.
MINDY=>Rosie, I feel so stupid. I haven't been much of a hostess. Why don't you stay here? There must be something in the fridge I can tempt you with.
ROSE=>Thanks, Mindy, but it's not that. I just have to get out into the fresh air again. It's a real experience for me just to walk down a street.
MINDY=>I'll come with you.
ROSE=>No. You stay here and work. I won't be gone too long.
MINDY=>OK, Rosie. If you get dizzy or anything, call me.
BALDING MAN=>'Scuse me. I didn't mean to touch you.
BALDING MAN=>Well, pardon me for existing.
ROSE=>I thought you did it on purpose.
BALDING MAN=>No. Really. I was taking my jacket off and it brushed against you.
ROSE=>Oh, well, I'm sorry. I like seeing these movies but men are always bothering me. I guess I'm a little paranoid.
BALDING MAN=>Well, look. If I come and sit beside you everybody will think we're together and you'll be able to watch in peace. All I ask is a couple handfuls of popcorn.
ROSE=>OK. C'mon.
NEWSCASTER=>...decide that each municipality should take on the responsibility for setting up vaccination centers in community halls and health clinics. Police have criticized the City Hall decision, saying that evidence has come to light which indicates that normal rabies vaccine is completely ineffective against the new strain of the disease. They are asking instead for the organization of a series of militia-and army-controlled quarantine centers until such time as an effective vaccine is developed. Said one police spokesman: 'We are having trouble containing the known outbreaks of violence induced by the disease as it is. Imagine what will happen if it spreads through the city like a normal wave of the flu.'
MINDY=>I'm going, Rosie. I've left you some coffee on the stove. Turn it off if you go out, OK?
ROSE=>OK. 'Bye.
MINDY=>Aren't you going to wish me luck? Are you OK?
ROSE=>Brushing my teeth. Good luck.
MINDY=>Thanks. See you later.
LAPOINTE=>You'll pardon me, Mr. Stasiuk, but I think the mayor should be taking this epidemic more seriously than he is.
OFFICIAL=>A city is a complex machine, Mr. Lapointe. Every part needs constant attention. The mayor will listen to you, but you're not the only one. It takes time...
OFFICIAL=>Why have we stopped, Clark?
OFFICIAL=>Well, isn't there anyone around? Do we have to turn around?
OFFICIAL=>Clark... roll down your window and ask them why the road is blocked. It may be strike trouble. Be careful.
OFFICIAL=>Oh, Christ! Clark, let's get out quick! Quick, man!
LAPOINTE=>They've got the disease! Look at their eyes! Report that to your mayor!
YOUNG MAN=>Mind if I sit down?
ROSE=>No. I don't mind.
YOUNG MAN=>Nothing like Christmas, huh?
YOUNG MAN=>Ah... you smoke? You know... cigarettes? You smoke?
ROSE=>Yeah. Sure.
YOUNG MAN=>Great. Have one of mine.
YOUNG MAN=>No matches. You got a light?
YOUNG MAN=>Just a sec. I'll ask that guy over there for a light. OK? Be right back.
YOUNG MAN=>'Scuse me, Mac. Gotta light?
YOUNG COP=>Stand up! Stand up and put your hands behind your head!
YOUNG COP=>Outta the way! Get outta the way. He'll kill you! That man'll kill you!
YOUNG COP=>Oh, Christ... I didn't mean to hit the Santa Claus.
NEWSCASTER=>...and the crisis has now been officially granted epidemic status by officials of the World Health Organization. The Prime Minister was reluctant to officially declare a state of emergency, but as any citizen in the streets can tell you, martial law has come to Montreal. At an emergency vaccination center set up in the Atwater Metro Station, we spoke with a director of the World Health Organization who had just arrived from England to take charge of liaison with Health Bureaus in Western European countries.
GENTRY=>I don't think there's any question that martial law is needed in the city of Montreal at this point in time. It's a necessity. It has already been established that victims of the disease -- and it is not rabies, though it may be related to the rabies virus -- victims of the disease are beyond medical help once it has established itself to the degree of inducing violent behavior.
INTERVIEWER=>What you're saying, then, Dr. Gentry, is that...
GENTRY=>What I'm saying is very simple. It may not be very palatable for your viewers. Shooting down victims of the disease is as good a way of handling them as we've got. If we lock them up, they immediately go into a coma and die shortly afterwards. We've now got a vaccine that we think will work in a preventative way, but for those who are already incubating the disease... as far as we know, there's no hope for them.
NEWSCASTER=>All those receiving shots of the new vaccine are being issued plastic ID cards with a photo of the card holder. Viewers are urged not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary, and are reminded that if they do they must carry their vaccine cards with them. Police, army, and militia officers may demand to see them. Here is a list of vaccination centers in your area and the toll-free telephone number of our special emergency information center.
CYPHER=>Goodbye, Sergeant. You've been a wonderful host.
SERGEANT=>OK, Murray. Take it easy. You sure you don't want to stay out here with us? The city doesn't sound like a very appetizing place to be.
CYPHER=>I would, but my wife and kid... you know how it is.
READ=>C'mon, Murray. Rose is waitin' for me.
CYPHER=>OK, kid. Let's go.
OFFICER=>Remember to keep your windows up and your doors locked once you get into the city. Maybe the bug can't get you now, but that... ...that won't protect you from the crazies. Take care now.
MINDY=>Rose? Are you home?
MINDY=>Rose? Are you asleep?
MINDY=>Have you been out? Have you gotten your shot?
ROSE=>I... I've been afraid to go out. And, Mindy, I... I'm starving. I'm starving to death. And I don't want to eat. I don't want any more to eat.
MINDY=>Rosie, what's been going on? What's the matter with you? Poor kid. Well, don't worry any more. We're two tough ladies, you and me. We can handle anything we have to.
READ=>I can't believe it. It's like we were at war.
CYPHER=>Listen, Hart. We're going to my house first. I'm not going to relax until I know that everything there's OK. Once we're there, I'll give you the keys to the car and you can go get your girl.
READ=>OK. Thanks.
CYPHER=>Phone me when you get there, will you? Maybe you should bring Rose back here with you until this thing blows over.
READ=>Yeah. Listen, thanks for the car, Murray. I'll call you.
CYPHER=>Cecile? It's Murray, honey. I'm home.
CYPHER=>Cecile? I'm home, honey. Where are you?
MINDY=>That's it, Rosie. You just get as much sleep as you need. Don't think about anything. Let your mind drift.
GENTRY=>And so after using some rather elaborate tracking procedures and applying them to a map, we find that the disease does in fact seem to have a very specific place of origin.
INTERVIEWER=>Which is...?
GENTRY=>Which is the Keloid Clinic of Cosmetic Surgery, a few miles outside the town of Camelford. You can see with your own eyes how everything has spread out from there in geometrically increasing proportions. Now this pattern, in conjunction with some of our other statistics, indicates that there is a strong possibility that there is a special factor at work in the spread of the disease.
INTERVIEWER=>You mean a carrier.
GENTRY=>Well, at the risk of setting off a futile witch hunt... Yes. Someone like the infamous Typhoid Mary who incubates the disease and transmits it, but is herself immune to it.
INTERVIEWER=>What were they doing at the Keloid Clinic, Dr. Gentry?
GENTRY=>We've run into a certain amount of difficulty ascertaining what exactly was going on there. We know what it wasn't. It had nothing to do with germ warfare or the like... no secret government contracts...
MINDY=>Rose? Are you awake?
MINDY=>Oh, no. Rose! You can't! It's dangerous out there!
ROSE=>Mindy, Mindy. I don't want it to be you.
MINDY=>Of course it should be me. Who else but your best friend, Rose? I'll take care of you.
ROSE=>Oh, Mindy, I ache all over. I'm hurting from the inside out.
MINDY=>Well then, what you need is a nice, deep, hot bath. It'll seep in and relax you from the outside in.
ROSE=>It's not my fault. It's not my fault.
READ=>It's you. You're the one. It's been you all along.
ROSE=>What are you talking about?
READ=>You carry the plague. You've killed hundreds of people.
ROSE=>No... no... you don't know what you're talking about. I'm still me. I'm still Rose.
READ=>What did they do to you at the clinic? What did they turn you into?
ROSE=>I have to have blood. It's all I can eat. And it's your fault, not mine. It's your fault!
READ=>There must be some way to fix this... We'll go to the police... we'll go to the hospital...
READ=>Rose, I'm sorry... wait! Wait!
READ=>Rose, listen to me. You're right. We're in it together. We'll figure it all out together...
MUSTACHIOED MAN=>Can I help you? I've seen you around before, haven't I? I just moved out of this building. They keep sending my mail here.
ROSE=>I... yes, I'm a friend of Mindy Kent. I was supposed to meet her here, but she must have gone out.
MUSTACHIOED MAN=>Well, it's not safe to walk the streets these days, not for a while, anyway. Can I escort you somewhere? Have you been vaccinated? No? Me neither. My brother told me he had to line up for three hours. Who's got time?
ROSE=>Listen... I need a place to stay tonight. At least until Mindy shows up. Could I stay with you? For a little while?
MUSTACHIOED MAN=>I, ah... guess you could. I'm a single guy, you know. We'd be alone. That doesn't bother you?
MUSTACHIOED MAN=>I'm a nice guy, too. C'mon. My car's just down the street.
READ=>Hello?
ROSE=>It's me, Hart. I'm glad I managed to get you. Are you all right? Did I hurt you?
READ=>Rose, where are you? We should be together. Please, tell me where you are.
ROSE=>Well, what you said to me hurt me. It scared me. It scared me because I suddenly knew you might be right. And if you were right, about my being a carrier, I mean... then I... I murdered Mindy. I murdered a lot of people.
READ=>Rose, listen to me... No court of law would convict you...
ROSE=>So I decided to try a little experiment to prove that you were wrong about all that. You see? I'm being very positive, aren't I?
READ=>There's no reason for you to put yourself through anything like this...
ROSE=>So I found myself a partner for my experiment, a single guy, real normal and real healthy, and I took a little of his blood... just a bit... and I've locked myself in with him. And I'm going to stay here with him until I'm sure he's not going to get sick. And then I'll know that I'm not the one who started it all.
READ=>Rose, you've got to tell me where you are. You're committing suicide.
ROSE=>Hart, I just want you to be with me over the phone... just until I find out one way or the other. We can live together over the phone for a while. We can do that, can't we?
READ=>Oh, God. Rose, how long ago did you... take blood from the man you're with? How long ago?
ROSE=>Six hours. Maybe seven.
READ=>Rose, you've got to get out of there.
READ=>Please, Rose, just drop the phone and walk over to the door and run outta that place as fast as you can. You're not giving either of us a chance to think. We don't need this pressure... everything's so confused... We've got to just clear a space where we can be alone and sit down and talk about everything and figure out what to do... Rose? Get out of there, get out right now!
ROSE=>Hart... I'm afraid!
READ=>Rose! Rose!
