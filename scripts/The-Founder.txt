CARHOP GIRL=>Should be any minute.
DICK MCDONALD=>What’s that, Al? There’s a brand- new box in the storeroom!
CASHIER=>45 cents, please.
MAC MCDONALD=>Care for a little tour?
MAC MCDONALD=>First stop for every McDonald’s hamburger is the grill, manned by three cooks whose sole job is to grill those all-beef beauties to perfection.
DICK MCDONALD=>Turns out, quite a lot.
DICK MCDONALD=>Drive out the riff-raff.
DICK MCDONALD=>And a complete disaster.
MAC MCDONALD=>Millions of ‘em. Looked like something out of Exodus.
DICK MCDONALD=>Put Mac in the hospital.
ETHEL KROC=>I’m too old for this.
RAY KROC=>Ethel, this place--
RAY KROC=>One ticket, please.
MAC MCDONALD=>It’s your dream, Dick.
RAY KROC=>I don’t believe so.
HARVEY PELTZ=>Home telephone number?
EMPLOYEE=>Ray Kroc, line one.
DICK MCDONALD=>Unless we got violently disconnected.
JUNE MARTINO=>One moment, I’ll see if he’s in.
RAY KROC=>A second location?
RAY KROC=>Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers...
MAC MCDONALD=>I didn’t mean to leave the gate open...
RAY KROC=>What did they want?
RAY KROC=>All that ice cream.
JOAN SMITH=>A powdered milkshake. Costs a fraction of ice cream, no refrigeration necessary.
JOAN SMITH=>I think it’s a marvelous idea.
JOAN SMITH=>Chocolate or vanilla?
DICK MCDONALD=>And what would that be?
RAY KROC=>I’m being serious.
HARVEY PELTZ=>That’s quite alright.
RAY KROC=>Your point being...
RAY KROC=>It’s not a change.
RAY KROC=>I read about that.
JOAN SMITH=>Or before. Whenever.
RAY KROC=>You’d be surprised.
HARRY SONNEBORN=>That’s a fast-growing area.
HARRY SONNEBORN=>And cheaper. You’re talking a good 15 percent less per acre.
RAY KROC=>You heard me. Nah.
ETHEL KROC=>Please pass the salt.
DICK MCDONALD=>People will think it’s the whole company, not just the real-estate arm. Which I strongly suspect is what you hope.
MAC MCDONALD=>Do you understand that?
MAC MCDONALD=>Five, fourth letter E.
DICK MCDONALD=>And one percent of the company’s profits in perpetuity.
RAY KROC=>How many succeeded?
YOUNG MAN=>My name is Will Davis. I’m a reporter for the Los Angeles Times. I’m interested in doing a profile of you pegged to the opening of your hundredth location here.
LIMO DRIVER=>Comfortable, Mr. Kroc?
