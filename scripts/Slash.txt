KAREN=>Okay, Ray. I’m freezing. Get in the car.
CANDY=>Who’s Mama Cass?
CANDY=>They’ve gone darker. Bad vibes.
CARL=>Brace yourself.
JEREMIAH=>I’m just yankin’ your chain!
MAC=>I...pardon...?
JEREMIAH=>Just so you know. After your mother took you away, I wrote you. She returned every one of ’em.
SUZIE=>I’m talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We’ll be careful of the bed--
SUZIE=>We’re almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
JEREMIAH=>..As long as you’re stayin’...mind giving me a hand?
JEREMIAH=>May as well. They’re having a good time shooting tin cans.
KEITH=>Ow! Fuck. Ow!!
MAC=>Is that right?
KEITH=>And fuck you too. You’re just as crazy as all of ’em..."Macdonald."
KEITH=>MotherFUCKER!!!!
KEITH=>You should have asked the wizard for some brains, asshole.
IAN=>Are you crazy?
BILLY BOB=>You boys ...alright?
CANDY=>Aha. The Lovers.
JEREMIAH=>Hell, Gene, I’m just yanking your chain! Never saw ’em before in my life. You know kids. Probably smashed up daddy’s car, and now they’re too afraid to go home.
GENE=>Yeah. Could be.
GENE=>Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
SUZIE=>Dammit, Carl!!!!
IAN=>We’re here....
