MOVE IN=>on Max looking up at something as he reclines on a public bench.
MOVE IN=>on a tree branch - shaking gently in the wind.
MAX=>I'll find this structure, this order, this perfection.
MAX=>What are you doing?
MAX=>I didn't get to it.
SOL=>It's been a month.
MAX=>You found things...
AT GRAND STREET=>Max exits. He notices that the Skinny Man gets off - one car down - as well.
MARCY DAWSON=>I was just waiting for you. I thought you stood me up, so I was going to head home.
LENNY MEYER=>I gotta car, we can cruise over to my...

...THE MAIN ROOM=>where Devi leans over Max. Max's eyes are open while he continues to recite the number.
BLINDING WHITE VOID=>where Max continues to recite the number.
THE MAIN ROOM=>where Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her hand. We return to
THE BLINDING WHITE VOID=>where Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his fear filled eyes.
TIGHT ON=>a tree branch gently blowing in the wind.
