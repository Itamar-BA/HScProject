REED=>She said yes.
ROAD RAGER=>WILL YOU USE YOUR FREAKING TURN SIGNAL YOU FREAKING PANSY?
GUISEPPE=>That’s great news.
IN THE BACK=>Guiseppe - followed by Reed - goes deep into the refrigerator. Pulls out something in a LONG, BLACK CLOSED BOX.
REED=>What’s in it?
BACK OUT FRONT=>Reed, with the black box, and Guiseppe return. Kelvin approaches, smiles politely at Reed, then says to Guiseppe:
REED=>You’re welcome.
CLOSE ON: THE PHONE=>She has ONE NEW TEXT. From someone named ALEX. It reads:
“TODAY IS THE DAY!”=>She SMILES, somewhat shyly, as she reads this, then begins to type her response. EXT. LOYOLA HIGH SCHOOL - LACROSSE FIELD - MORNING The Loyola High School boys lacrosse practice is winding down. ALEX, 18, still in uniform, with helmet off, stands on the sideline watching the second string run some drills. His PHONE, which sits in his helmet on the ground, BUZZES. He picks it up, reads the return text from JANICE:
“YES!!!!!”=>He smiles in anticipation. EXT. APARTMENT - DAY A 1940s four-plex on Spaulding. The typical just-moved-to- L.A.-in-your-20s crash pad. INT. APARTMENT - SAME These apartments all have the same floor plan - all of the rooms off of a long, narrow hallway. In one of the bedrooms we find JASON and LIZ curled up under a sheet. The decor says 25 year old messy guy.
LIZ=>This, however, might start to draw attention...
DOWN THE HALLWAY=>Edgar and Estelle walk, both dressed now. She in her lipstick. He with slicked hair. Both adhering to the old ways of being “dressed” for the breakfast table. She leans into him. He links her arm into his. They stop in the doorway, watching Edison write out his Valentines. A sadness passes over Estelle.
IN THE KITCHEN=>Where Edison refers to his class list and starts addressing the rest when Edgar and Estelle walk in. They both kiss their grandson, when Estelle notices the empty cereal bowl.
ANCHOR=>His contract is up, and at 35, he’s not getting any younger. Do the Chargers want him back? If not, will he test the waters of free agency? Or will he make this easier on everyone and just retire?
ANCHOR=>We expect an answer to all these questions and more over the next few days...
SEAN=>It sounds fun.
KARA=>No it doesn’t. SEAN
SEAN=>Expecting a big turnout?
REED=>That’s bad?
OLIVIA=>This is for you.
ALEXANDRA=>What was that for? HARRISON
JULIA=>No they’re not.
JASON=>Shit. I didn’t even say Happy Valentine’s Day.
EDISON=>Only you didn’t say a word because you were afraid. EDGAR
EDISON=>You don’t have to come in. I can do this myself.
JANICE=>Sure - of course.
RECEPTIONIST=>They’ll be right down.
DREW=>They’ve decided not to pursue resigning you.
SEAN=>Kara, you get it, right?
REED=>I’m the owner.
REED=>I understand.
HARRISON=>No. Now, look. I thought we had an understanding.
ALEX=>It relaxes me.
ALEX=>No - the naked part came after I told her that.
KELVIN=>Has he seen it?
KELVIN=>Well, the press release just came off the wire... KARA
KELVIN=>Yeah right. I can’t wait for this day to be over.
FLORA VAN.=>He gets out and approaches the van - as ALPHONSO gets out of the driver side, not happy. Sean is instantly apologetic.
ALPHONSO=>Keep your eyes open friend.
THE DOORS OPEN AGAIN.=>SEVERAL flower arrangements fall out, hitting the ground in a kaleidoscope of glass and color. Cards hitting the pavement. We narrow in on one card: EDISON’S ENVELOPE with the simple red heart. EXT. LITTLE SANTA MONICA - BEVERLY HILLS - CONTINUOUS Alphonso pulls over quickly. Picks up his cell phone. EXT. SANTA MONICA BLVD. - BEVERLY HILLS - DAY Quickly, Reed and Alphonso are transferring all the floral arrangements from Alphonso’s bum van to Reed’s van. Reed is upset, thrown off his game.
REED=>Really? Why?
JULIA=>Now, please.
JULIA=>What? You said you liked spontaneous. REED
DANNY=>Girls love cemeteries on Valentine’s Day.
ALPHONSO=>Where are we going?
REED=>I know but -
REED=>Be right back.
AT THE FRONT DOOR=>Reed goes to the door, pulls out his keys. But as he tries to put them in, the door just SWINGS OPEN. Reed looks confused. Warily enters the house... INT. REED BENNETT’S HOUSE - SAME Reed looks around as he enters. Calls out:
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY=>Reed reaches the top of the stairs, still holding the black box, and turns into the: INT. BEDROOM - SAME Morley sits on the bed. REED
MORLEY=>I’m sorry Reed.
REED=>What feeling?
KARA=>Well, it is.
JULIA=>What about Dana?
KARA=>New boyfriend. JULIA
JULIA=>I’m really sorry honey.
WITH JANICE=>As she sits on the grassy hill. Her PHONE BUZZES. She looks at it: a NEW TEXT from Alex. It reads: LOOK BEHIND YOU. Janice turns around, but sees nothing but the beginning of a wooded area about 10 feet behind her. She texts back: WHAT? She watches Edison meander around the field for a second before she gets another text: LOOK CLOSER. She turns around again, this time scanning the wooded area. Then she sees Alex, standing at the tree line, waving her over. She looks quite confused. She checks on Edison, who’s still moping through his soccer game, then gets up and walks over to Alex.
ALEX=>So, you know how I said I’d figure something out?
JANICE=>You know - for a valedictorian you are a HUGE IDIOT!
OVERSIZED ITEMS CHECK-IN=>REED
REED=>He’s married. JULIA
UNITED GATE AGENT=>We are now boarding all sections. All sections, please come forward.
JULIA=>Why are you doing this?
JULIA=>What? What does that have to do with anything? REED
UNITED GATE AGENT=>Last call for all sections. Now boarding all sections on United Flight 954 to San Francisco.
HOLDEN=>You look pretty.
HOLDEN=>Are you nervous?
JANICE=>Tell me about it.
SUSAN=>Bullshit. You found what you wanted to find. Susan backs up, annoyed.
EVENING=>Julia, in her car, still in her black dress, flies out of the parking structure for the LA hospital. Letting us know now, she’s in Los Angeles, not San Francisco. Overnight bag in the seat beside her. She never got on the plane. EXT. LOS FELIZ HOME - NIGHT A simple triplex. Fenced in by chain link. Not a great neighborhood. When the Rita Flora Delivery Van pulls up. Reed is still driving. Alphonso is ASLEEP the passenger seat. INT. RITA FLORA DELIVERY VAN - LOS FELIZ - NIGHT Reed looks at Alphonso, totally PASSED OUT. He smiles, shakes him gently on the shoulder. Alphonso stirs.
ALEXANDRA=>Oh, is he just kicking, or are you having contractions?
ALEXANDRA=>Are you here alone?
JASON=>Sorry we had to wait so long. That was ridiculous.
LIZ=>No problem.
SEAN=>No, I got it. DREW
AT THE CURB=>Holden turns, looking for Kate. He finds her, standing in the long taxi line. Holden says to the Driver:
HOLDEN=>I’ve got a car -
IN THE KITCHEN=>Ten year old student RANI picks up more empty water glasses when her father, DEECHUM, Indian , stops her.
IN THE RESTAURANT=>Kara is now standing on the booth, back to us, aggressively tying off her home-printed banner -- I HATE VALENTINE’S DAY -- between the two columns of the booth. She takes a string of hearts, now cut in half, and hangs them framing the booth.
EDGAR=>Just one please.
JASON=>Not a good one. EDGAR
EDGAR=>That’s my girl.
JULIA=>Look, I just - I really don’t wanna talk about it.
JULIA=>Hi. I’m Julia.
JULIA=>So - Kelvin - how do you come to this sad affair? KELVIN
JULIA=>What the hell?
EDISON=>I know - I know - JANICE
REED=>Everything OK?
EDISON=>Thanks Mr. Flora.
ON THE CRYPT=>The film plays. And it’s Estelle. A young Estelle. Beautiful. A life barely lived. Rapturously kissing Rock Hudson when a BODY stands in front of the crypt, blocking the images for the entire audience. Who immediately shouts:
JANICE=>OK. This isn’t working.
AT THE FRONT DOOR=>Reed enters the restaurant. Takes a few steps in to watch Edison deliver his flowers. But then he sees who Edison is approaching - JULIA. Reed can’t believe his eyes.
WITH EDISON AND JULIA=>As Edison stops in front of Julia, box in hand. Now the whole party is watching. He holds it out to her.
EDISON=>This is for you. JULIA
EDISON=>Rani? But I don’t love her. She’s just my friend. JULIA
REED=>You are not a loser. You just - deserve better.
BEGIN MONTAGE:=>Music cue: This Will Be Our Year - The Zombies INT. KTLA NEWS ROOM - NIGHT Kelvin sits behind the news desk, doing his 10 o’clock report.
IN THE DOORWAY=>Stands Edgar and Estelle, in their pajamas, holding hands. They silently watch the reunion of their daughter and their grandson. Then quietly turn and give them space. INT. JANICE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT Janice sits up in her bed, which is still surrounded by the candles Alex brought. They are all lit. She’s paging through the YALE COURSE CATALOG. Her PHONE BUZZES. She picks it up - there’s a NEW TEXT
MESSAGE FROM ALEX:=>I’ll always love you. She smiles, closes her phone. Curls up in bed. INT. ALPHONSO’S HOUSE - NIGHT Alphonso and his WIFE are dead asleep, buffered by their kids - ALPHONSO JR. AND CARMEN who sleep between them.
SEAN=>I don’t care.
