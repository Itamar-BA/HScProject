LEON=>OK. Good. Now you can assemble your weapon.
LEON=>The rifle is the first weapon you learn to use, because you can keep far from the client. The more experience you have, the closer you get.
LEON=>No. Always take it off at the last moment, because of light reflexes. They'll see you in two seconds.
LEON=>Relax. You must feel at ease.
MATHILDA=>OK, I'm fine.
LEON=>Good.
LEON=>Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
MATHILDA=>Huh... 500 meters?
LEON=>130... 140...
MATHILDA=>How can you say it?
LEON=>Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters. When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot. Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss. A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5. You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
MATHILDA=>What, for example?
LEON=>Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
MATHILDA=>What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
LEON=>Rocket launcher.
MATHILDA=>Oh really? But can you miss the car?
MATHILDA=>Wow! It's brilliant!
LEON=>Yeah... Come on, have a little training.
MATHILDA=>Who'll I aim at?
LEON=>Whoever.
MATHILDA=>No women... No kids....
LEON=>Begin from a steady target. It's easier.
MATHILDA=>The fat man down there, on the bench.
LEON=>Perfect.
LEON=>Try again. The same.
LEON=>Wait...
LEON=>Bull's-eye.
LEON=>Come on, now a walking one.
LEON=>Good! First shot!
MATHILDA=>Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
LEON=>It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
MATHILDA=>OK.
LEON=>Now, try a running guy.
LEON=>OK.
MATHILDA=>Shit! It's hard when he runs!
LEON=>Don't lose him! Concentrate. There, reload. OK, keep calm. Calm, breathe deeply. Look at his movements. Imagine you're running with him. Breathe... Hold your breathe... His movements... Now...
MATHILDA=>Did you see? First shot! It's good, isn't it? Did I learn well?
LEON=>Codes!
LEON=>For codes, there are two solutions. You have to choose depending on your needs. First case: you have time. You need the code for a later time. So, you wait for night, you get a box with soot powder and blow a little on the keyboard. He does it and pulls out a screwdriver.
LEON=>Then you break the little lamp to be sure the client can't see anything. You wait for someone who gets inside, so you have just to see which numbers he touched. Once you know the four or five
LEON=>Here, wires need the code. Always four wires.
MAN=>May I...?
LEON=>Pardon. Let pass.
MAN=>Excuse me, but... What are you doing?
LEON=>I teach to the girl.
MAN=>Do you teach her how to break buildings' doors, don't you? Don't you give a shit about me? Get away before I call the Police! The man is very nervous, searches in a pocket, then pulls out an anti-aggression bomblet. He'll have no time to use it: Leon pulled out his silenced gun. A shot to the hand and the bomblet takes off. Shot's energy makes the man turn around. A second shot in the back makes the man get over the parapet and disappear in a decorative bush, almost without noise. Mathilda is immobilized. Leon looks around, then resumes.
LEON=>So... the wire which starts from the bottom of the metal part and then, you try the other three wires, one by one.
LEON=>Simple, isn't it?
LEON=>What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
MATHILDA=>Yes, yes...
MATHILDA=>It's incredible! How did you do it?
LEON=>What?
MATHILDA=>There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
MATHILDA=>It was brilliant.
LEON=>...Look! Even the wall, nothing stops him. The movement goes on. He uses everything: soil, wall, his rush, his weight. Life is movement, death is a part of it.
MATHILDA=>...It's brilliant.
TONY'S RESTAURANT=>Leon sits in front of Tony. From his position, he can see the window on the street.
TONY=>It's a long time, Leon. You missed two nice contracts, you know.
TONY=>...You moved too, didn't you?
LEON=>Yeah.
TONY=>Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
LEON=>...Not at all.
TONY=>It's better... You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf. I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
LEON=>Yes.
TONY=>At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
LEON=>Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
TONY=>That's what I later told myself! No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
LEON=>Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
TONY=>Do you need money?
LEON=>No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
TONY=>It's true, you're right... Did you meet a woman?
LEON=>No, no.
LEON=>Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
TONY=>Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
TONY=>Anyway, you can't have a bank account, so the discussion is finished.
LEON=>Why can't I have a bank account?
TONY=>I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu. That's why you can't have a bank account!
TONY=>But your money is there, Leon. When you want, you ask me. Take...
TONY=>Take...
LEON=>Well, I don't need them...
TONY=>Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
LEON=>Thanks.
LEON=>I've got a hit perfect for you. I kept it for you. To be made alone. That's what you like. Don't move, I get the file. Manolo! A glass of milk for Leon!
LEON=>Keep away. He looks suspicious. A bad guy, OK?
LEON=>Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
MATHILDA=>OK.
TONY=>I have to put on my glasses... My sight is worse and worse... I'm getting old... Here it is.
TONY=>Not easy. Armored car, isolated home, bodyguards all time. I don't know what
TONY=>I write client's data on the back. You have to be quick, he's going to quit the city at the end of the week. With the contracts on his head, I don't think we'll see him again.
LEON=>I come back later for details. I've got something to do and... I'm late.
LEON=>Come on, get down!
MATHILDA=>You were scared, weren't you?
LEON=>I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
MATHILDA=>I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
MATHILDA=>Let's go home!!!
MATHILDA=>We'd a nice walk!
MATHILDA=>Leon? I think I'm falling in love with you.
MATHILDA=>...Anyway, this impressed you!
MATHILDA=>It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
LEON=>How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
MATHILDA=>...Because I feel it.
MATHILDA=>Here... in my stomach... it's hot.
MATHILDA=>I always had a knot... No longer...
LEON=>Mathilda, I'm... I'm very happy you've got no more stomach ache, but... this doesn't mean anything. I'm late for work and I don't like being late for work.
LEON=>Mathilda? May I come in?
MATHILDA=>Yes.
MATHILDA=>Yes... You can come in.
LEON=>Take it, please.
LEON=>I... I've got a contract... I've got to go now. It's urgent. ...So, you stay here. You don't move. About telephone, I let it ring once then I call you back, else you don't answer, OK?
MATHILDA=>Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now. You said I learn very quickly.
LEON=>Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
LEON=>Go on learning like this... Then we'll see.
LEON=>No.
MATHILDA=>For musicals? That's part of the job!
LEON=>No, you can't go out.
LEON=>During my absence, you have to work on a very important thing you badly lack: patience.
LEON=>You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
MATHILDA=>I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
RECEPTIONIST=>Did you lose your key, Mister?
LEON=>No... I just thought if I'd lost anything...
RECEPTIONIST=>And did you forget anything?
LEON=>Yeah... But "forgotten" doesn't mean lost
RECEPTIONIST=>How are you, Miss?
MATHILDA=>Fine...
MATHILDA=>I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
RECEPTIONIST=>I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
MATHILDA=>Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
RECEPTIONIST=>Huh? That's smart!
MATHILDA=>I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music.
RECEPTIONIST=>Yeah, true. But what does your father exactly do for living?
MATHILDA=>...Composer.
RECEPTIONIST=>Huh, that's good!
MATHILDA=>Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
RECEPTIONIST=>Huh?
MATHILDA=>...No... he's my lover...
MATHILDA=>I'm going to have a walk... I'll come
MATHILDA'S OLD BUILDING=>Mathilda slowly gets to her floor. In front of the door, a thin yellow "no entry" police strip. A cop is distractedly guarding the hall; he's talking with a young black girl. Mathilda gets in her apartment unnoticed. She gets in her room, recovers her teddy bear and her Polaroid. Then, she gets in the devastated living room. There's dry blood almost everywhere. In the corridor, she raises one of parquet's boards. A big roll of 100$ bills is hidden beneath. There is a small check-book too. She carelessly puts everything away. Noise in the apartment. Mathilda crouches down. Stansfield gets in together with two more guys. Mathilda can see them without being seen. Stansfield is evidently not at ease, he's justifying his actions in front of upper-rank officers.
STANSFIELD=>So, the guy was there, he'd hidden a shotgun behind the tent, here. His woman was armed too.
MAN=>Where were the kids during first shots?
STANSFIELD=>I don't know... that was very fast. I didn't see him pulling out his weapon.
SECOND MAN=>Did you follow the procedure? Who got to the door?
MAN=>The fact you're a public officer doesn't give you the right to do whatever you want! The narcotic had been following this guy for two years. They had a lot of information about him. Your quick lonely action upset them. It's normal they asked for an inquiry.
MAN=>It's routine, why are you doing this to us?
IN THE STREET=>Stansfield gets on a car and departs. Mathilda stops a cab and gets on board.
MATHILDA=>May you follow that blue car, please?
DRIVER=>Do you also want music and skids at every turn?
MATHILDA=>No, I want you to drive smoothly, get your 100$ and tell me what the last question was.
MATHILDA=>What's that man's name?
COP=>Why do you want to know?
MATHILDA=>He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
COP=>Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little
MATHILDA=>Give me his name, I will mail him.
COP=>OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
MATHILDA=>...Office 2702.
COP=>Yeah... How do you know it?
MATHILDA=>...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
LEON=>...It's for you... It's a gift.
LEON=>Would you like me to open it? ...I open it! ...Do you like it?
LEON=>...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
MATHILDA=>...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
LEON=>Do you think you learnt patience today?!
LEON=>...You stayed home, not bad. A good start.
MATHILDA=>I've been out all the time, stupid!
MATHILDA=>I got home to get my stuff.
MATHILDA=>Here. Not 8000. They're 6800. I hope you will credit me for the missing 1200. Furthermore, I'm going to make your work easier: the guy is Norman Stansfield. Office 2702 at FBI, 5th Avenue, 68th Street.
LEON=>And... How do you know all this?
LEON=>Are you calmly telling me you spent the day at FBI?
MATHILDA=>No! I can't come in! I remained outside! And why do you mind this? You've got client's name, money's on the table: it's a good contract, isn't it?
LEON=>Not taken.
MATHILDA=>Why?
LEON=>Too heavy.
MATHILDA=>Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
LEON=>I never rent my gear.
LEON=>Mathilda, nothing is the same, after you kill someone. Your life changes forever. You'll can never cancel it, neither from your memory, nor from your criminal record... You'll never sleep again like before, Mathilda.
MATHILDA=>If you knew, Leon...! I killed one thousand in my head... And this never disturbed my sleep.
LEON=>OK... And if it's you who gets killed? ...Then? Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
LEON=>Painful, isn't it? You don't like talking about death because you're like everyone: you fear it...
LEON=>...Well, it's this fear that makes you
LEON=>...You can't pretend to make this job, until you get beyond this stage. The day you get free of this fear... Not before...
MATHILDA=>Leon... I have no fear... It's so.
LEON=>OK...
LEON=>One shot ahead... I start.
MATHILDA=>...Love or death. She gets the barrel in her mouth and looks at Leon. A tear drop on Leon's front. She pulls the trigger. Nothing. She puts down the gun. Leon stands up, turns around the table and embraces her. He holds her tight. She's surprised. She kindly pushes Leon back, to look at his eyes.
MATHILDA=>Am I ready?
MATHILDA=>What are you doing?
LEON=>I'm looking for chain's position. Sometimes you can't see it, but you can feel it... Here.
LEON=>I ring and you make him open, OK?
LEON=>Whatever you want.
MAN=>Yes?
MATHILDA=>Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
MATHILDA=>...I got lost, Mister.
MAN=>Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
MATHILDA=>It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
MATHILDA=>Mister... I'm scared.
MAN=>Huh? Don't move, baby.
LEON=>Open your mouth.
LEON=>Good... Safety, now. The second shot. Mathilda approaches the man and shoots again. Maybe too low: a squirt of blood on her dresses.
LEON=>Here it is! Look at your dresses, now! How can you walk in the street, now?
LEON=>Good.
LEON=>...Let's go.
LEON=>It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
MATHILDA=>And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
MATHILDA=>...Yes.
MATHILDA=>...I'm going to kiss you.
LEON=>Mathilda, stop, please!
MATHILDA=>Come on, let me do. Just a kiss.
LEON=>Stop. Everyone is looking.
MATHILDA=>Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
MATHILDA=>Tongue, please.
MATHILDA=>...You don't believe me, don't you?
LEON=>What?
MATHILDA=>When I say I love you.
LEON=>Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
MATHILDA ...OK.=>I love you anyway.
LEON=>Mathilda?!
MATHILDA=>OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
LEON=>...17.
MATHILDA=>Beat you!
LEON=>...Shit!! We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
MATHILDA=>What shall we do?
LEON=>I think.
LEON=>Where are you going?
MATHILDA=>Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
LEON=>...Why didn't he close the window?
LEON=>...Because he didn't get out!
MATHILDA=>It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
LEON=>There are better things. You see the importance of the "moment". Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it. This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
MATHILDA=>...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
LEON=>...Later.
MATHILDA=>OK... I like it. It gives me the rhythm.
MAN=>...Yes?
MATHILDA=>Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
MAN=>...One second.
MAN=>Come on, little stupid? Is it enough or want some more! Then? Come on, show me your face! Come!
MAN=>Did you think you could get me by such an old trick?! The gum trick, I played it before your birth, idiot! Come on, show me your little fucking face! The gum trick! Huh! I go.
MAN=>The ring trick? ...Come on, little idiot! Show me your famous trick. Come on, I'm waiting! Come!
MAN=>...Shit.
TONY'S RESTAURANT=>About 4pm. Restaurant is desert, apart from Dino, who's keeping books at his usual table. An elegantly dressed man gets inside. He's forced to put away his sunglasses because of the feeble interior light. He looks nervous. He sits in front of Tony. He's a little surprised.
TONY=>Tell me, there's nobody in the restaurant: you're not forced to sit at my table?
TONY=>Rinaldi... Rinaldi... What region do you come from?
RINALDI=>Messina.
TONY=>Emilio? Due grappe! ...Why the hell did you come here?
RINALDI=>Rightly... I came here to recover.
TONY=>But... He works for your same employer?
RINALDI=>Yeah, but I don't give a shit about. I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
TONY=>It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon. It really isn't the usual procedure...
RINALDI=>I know... But I'm a little pressed.
TONY=>...Who sent you?
RINALDI=>Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
TONY=>Is he still alive?
RINALDI=>Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.
TONY=>Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
RINALDI=>No... Dino's.
RINALDI=>He's dead, five years ago...
TONY=>Have you ever been in Messina, son?
RINALDI=>Yes... Twice.
TONY=>Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
RINALDI=>No...
TONY=>It's a specialty down there. It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
TONY=>A lookout above, one below, two fishers and a captain. A lot of people, for such a small boat like that. They depart to the sea, sometimes for days, never sure they'll get something.
RINALDI=>I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
TONY=>You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always. It's the only important thing in the world.
RINALDI=>...Yeah.
TONY=>Salute.
RINALDI=>Salute.
LEON=>Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
MATHILDA=>That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
LEON=>Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
LEON=>...I prefer apartments... Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
MATHILDA=>Friends? You're crazy! In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
LEON=>You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
MATHILDA=>A little...
LEON=>Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
MATHILDA=>Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
LEON=>Well, then watch television!
LEON=>...I won't be long, Mathilda, OK?
MATHILDA=>Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
MATHILDA=>Risky business, isn't it?
LEON=>...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out. You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
MATHILDA=>There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two!
LEON=>Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
MATHILDA=>Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
LEON=>...Nothing, I tell you! Everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid.
LEON=>No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
MATHILDA=>You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
LEON=>Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
MATHILDA=>I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
LEON=>I won't be long. Two days at most, promised.
MATHILDA=>...Good day, Madam, may I talk with Jenny, please?
JENNY=>Yes?
JENNY=>HEY!! But what did you do?! What happened?? It's months you've
JENNY=>Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you. But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
MATHILDA=>No?
JENNY=>She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
MATHILDA=>Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
JENNY=>Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
MATHILDA=>No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
JENNY=>YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
MATHILDA=>No.
JENNY=>Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
JENNY=>I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it! And did he pass your threshold or not?
MATHILDA=>...What?
JENNY=>Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
MATHILDA=>No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.
JENNY=>...Good... But what's special in him?
MATHILDA=>...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
MATHILDA=>I'll miss you, Jenny.
TONY'S RESTAURANT=>The old Tony at his usual table. Three little boys in front of him. Their hands on their eyes.
TONY=>Don't peep, OK? Attention...
TONY=>You can look!
STANSFIELD=>Happy birthday!
TONY=>You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you. Norman smiles.
STANSFIELD=>I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result. It's right this that makes me nervous, now. I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
TONY=>Then...
STANSFIELD=>Do you recognize him?
TONY=>...Even his mother wouldn't.
STANSFIELD=>You're right.
STANSFIELD=>I've got an offer for you: you keep your 12000$, you call back your shitful cleaner and you tell him the contract is cancelled. You see, the man to be killed is my boss, and I'd be really sorry with losing him because he's a good boss. He lets me work like I wish... It's fine. And 12000$ to do nothing aren't bad, aren't they?
TONY=>Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
STANSFIELD=>May we have this wolf's name and address?
TONY=>These guys have no place. They change virtually everyday. And his name... It's
STANSFIELD=>...Come on, I make you a favor. Tell me which is the one you love least. I'll kill him first.
TONY=>You know, boy, I know their parents very well; I think they won't appreciate your sense of humor.
STANSFIELD=>It's good he had no family. Come on, speak, now!
STANSFIELD=>Else, I'll have to ruin this birthday.
STANSFIELD=>Thanks Tony. Justice will be grateful for your precious collaboration.
STANSFIELD=>...Would you like me to call the police, for this little incident?
STANSFIELD=>Good!
NEW BUILDING=>Mathilda sits at stairways' end, in front of a long corridor and a small court. Five kids, about 13-year-old, play baseball in the corridor.
THE BOSS=>You're the new one at 5th?
THE BOSS=>Shall we explain her everything, ok? This will avoid misunderstandings.
THE BOSS=>You can't sit here like that.
MATHILDA=>Huh? Why?
THE BOSS=>Because you have to pay. It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
MATHILDA=>...And how much is it?
THE BOSS=>Ten dollars... A month.
MATHILDA=>Got the change for 100?
MATHILDA=>...It's not serious... It means I'll pay ten months in advance.
THE BOSS=>...OK... Good.
MATHILDA=>Can I sit on the stairways now?
THE BOSS=>Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
A KID=>...Would you like a cigarette?
MATHILDA=>Yes... Thanks.
THE KID=>A little draught?
MATHILDA=>No thanks... Never alcohol.
THE BOSS=>...Bitch! You're really nil! Come on,
THE BOSS=>You fear a ball?! I can't believe it!! Gals!... Come on, let's play, not a game for gals!
THE BOSS=>Good, let's have a break, five minutes. Poly? Cigarettes.
MATHILDA=>Look, the fearful's got a game for you.
MATHILDA=>...You can show me your balls! Russian roulette, you know?
LEON=>...I live in here...
COP=>No entry for the moment.
LEON=>I live in here.
COP=>When I say no entry, I mean "no entry".
IN THE APARTMENT=>A plain clothes detective sits in front of Mathilda, who's crying on her couch. Evidently, the cop's waiting for her to stop crying, for interrogation. He looks at his wristwatch.
LEON=>I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
MATHILDA=>I love you so much, Leon.
LEON=>I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
COP=>Can I have a word with you, Mister? Are you her father?
MATHILDA=>...Well... The kids. They didn't want me to play baseball. They said I'm a fearful gal.
LEON=>Poor darling, and then?
MATHILDA=>Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost.
LEON=>Don't cry, Mathilda, please. Take. Prepare your case and we get away for a while, OK? We change neighborhoods! Come on, go, I wait, OK?
LEON=>Come on, prepare your stuff, we move in a much calmer place, you'll see. Near the country.
STANSFIELD=>...I've been following the guy for a while.
COMMANDER=>May I know this typhoon's name?
STANSFIELD=>...Leon.
LEON=>Mathilda?
MATHILDA=>Yes... Alright.
LEON=>Mathilda?
LEON=>What's going on?
MATHILDA=>Of course! I'm fine! I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up... I tried to get beautiful! Don't you like it?
MATHILDA=>So say it!
MATHILDA=>...Don't you drink?
LEON=>I prefer waiting for a while... I feel it would go the wrong way.
LEON=>...No...
MATHILDA=>...Don't you like me?
MATHILDA=>You know, girls think about their first boyfriend for a long time... I imagined him with grizzled hair, elegant... A little like Georgia's father. Georgia is a classmate of mine... Kinda guy makes you feel sure! Cool, isn't it? Leon nods yes, without really knowing what he's saying "yes" to. My mates told me the first time they made love was awful. They had pain everywhere, afterward... But that's because they made it with men they didn't love. In fact, they did it just to show off, at the beginning. Later, they liked it. ...Like cigarettes.
MATHILDA=>How many girlfriends did you have?
LEON=>...I don't know.
MATHILDA=>Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
LEON=>...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
MATHILDA=>Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me? I won't get shocked.
LEON=>Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
MATHILDA=>I talk because you don't talk, Leon. I declare my love and you say nothing. That's why I'm nervous and I can't stop talking. Tell me you love me, or you don't love me, or you love someone else. ....But tell me something.
LEON=>...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago. Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids... Her father didn't want her to meet me. My family was not very respectable.
MATHILDA=>Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you? You met anyway?
LEON=>...He killed her, a bullet in her head...
MATHILDA=>...That's awful. I hope you killed, that asshole?
LEON=>...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony. ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city... And never had another girlfriend...
MATHILDA=>Leon, I don't know life very much... I just know I love you... And love is stronger than anything else.
LEON=>Maybe... Sure... But... I'm scared, Mathilda.
MATHILDA=>Don't fear, Leon. You mustn't fear love, when it's this beautiful.
MATHILDA=>...Because you deserve it, Leon...
MORNING=>A beautiful morning, like one wishes everyone to be. Leon in the bed. It's the first time one sees him in a bed and, furthermore, he sleeps. By his side, on a small table, a gun. You never know. On the other side, Mathilda looks at him, smiling, because he's almost nice while he sleeps. She starts
MATHILDA=>Did you sleep well?
LEON=>...I never really sleep.
MATHILDA=>Huh, yes? I forgot! ...When you fake sleeping, you'd better not snore!
MATHILDA=>Like a baby!
MATHILDA=>I go looking for some milk for breakfast... I come back. ...I love you, Leon.
LEON=>You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
MATHILDA=>Yes.
LEON=>Three times, then two times.
MATHILDA=>May I ask you a personal question?
LEON=>...Yes.
MATHILDA=>What do you do, with the money you earn?
LEON=>Nothing, for the moment.
LEON=>Yeah, what?
MATHILDA=>I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example... And forgetting all this...
MATHILDA=>I'm gonna buy a globe, you'll see. Bronx isn't even marked, so much the rest is big. ...Think...
INSIDE THE BUILDING=>Mathilda comes back with her milk. She gets out of the lift and a hand covers her mouth.
THE BOSS=>Is he alone?
THE BOSS=>Does he expect you?
THE BOSS=>Have you got apartment's keys?
THE BOSS=>Is there a code, a way to knock the door or something?
MAN=>Don't fear.
MATHILDA=>I have no fear.
MAN=>Shit! We need reinforcements! Maximum! Come on!
MATHILDA=>Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
LEON=>It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
MATHILDA=>I don't know... Five minutes.
LEON=>Good! Snipers can't be in position.
LEON=>...Ten minutes at least... Not five.
MATHILDA=>How shall we get out now, Leon?
LEON=>Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
MATHILDA=>But... Leon? You'll never get in it! It's nearly too small for me!?
MATHILDA=>No! I don't want to leave you!!
LEON=>Mathilda, listen!
MATHILDA=>No, no! I don't want to go! I don't want!
LEON=>Listen to me, shit! We've got no chance to get out together! Alone, I will get out! Trust me! I'm in perfect shape, Mathilda, now! I slept well! I love you! I'm happy! And I thought! I'll get all the money Tony keeps for me and we'll leave, OK? Together! We'll leave tomorrow.
MATHILDA=>You say it just to calm me!
LEON=>Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
LEON=>Come on, go! Don't let them find you! I finish this work and we meet at Tony's, OK? Spread your arms to do not fall too fast. So, good. At Tony's! One hour or two, OK? I love you, Mathilda!
MATHILDA=>I love you too, my darling.
APARTMENT=>A wounded cop, mask on his face, gets out of the apartment and out of the smoke cloud.
A BOSS=>Get downstairs, guy, get down!
DOCTOR=>It's deep. You'd better get down to the ambulance, they'll care you properly. A cop chief doesn't recognize Leon.
CHIEF=>3rd district? ...A mess up there, isn't it.
LEON=>Let me put my mask on. I breathe better with it.
DOCTOR=>Yeah, right. Get down and wait for ten minutes. I'll get to check you, OK?
LEON=>OK.
IN THE APARTMENT=>A cop's checking out the apartment, he pushes kitchen's door and a grenade falls to his feet. The explosion shakes the whole corridor. Cops crowd it. Below, Leon exploits the moment to stand up and discreetly walk downstairs. Floor after floor without problems.
RIGHT HAND=>It's alright! We got him! It's over!
CHIEF=>Shit! Never seen anything like this before!
ANOTHER=>He almost fucked me, furthermore!
STANSFIELD=>He killed Richmond, my boss, two days ago... And Rinaldi too! We've been on him for months.
CHIEF=>Nice shot.
