NICK:=>To do what?

CONFUSED. DAN:=>...but it's a woman's world out there.
DAN:=>And getting into a woman's psyche is not exactly your strong suit. You can get into their pants better than anybody on earth, but their psyche is a whole other ballgame.
DAN:=>I know she hasn't done it totally on her own yet, but somebody else was gonna grab her.
DAN O.S.:=>And she's smart, Nick.
NICK:=>You made her creative director?
DAN O.S.:=>I'm sorry, buddy.
DAN:=>This isn't easy for me. But I got the breathing down my neck. She's coming in this afternoon. You'll meet her. Come on, roll with this. Work with her. Because she's got what I need to keep this place afloat.

DAN O.S.:=>...as a leader in the field precedes her.
DAN O.S.:=>At B.B.D.&O....
TABLE FACING FG. DAN:=>...Darcy lead a creative team that snagged 500 million in new business wins. And that was just last year alone. Here at Sloane Curtis, we've always prided ourselves on our strategic thinking. Now it's time for us to step up and once again prove ourselves creatively in the marketplace.
TO ROLL HIS EYES. DAN O.S.:=>And I'm thrilled that Darcy has consented...
DAN:=>...to move across town, join our team and
APPLAUD. DARCY:=>Wow.
DARCY:=>Thank you, Dan. And thank you all for that warm welcome.
DARCY:=>Let me start off by saying that the feeling is mutual. I'm absolutely thrilled to be here.
DARCY O.S.:=>When I first started in this business, it was my dream...
DARCY:=>...to work at Sloane Curtis. In fact, I believe I even applied for a job here, twice.
DAN:=>Somebody call personnel.
DARCY:=>But, it was B.B.D.&O. that offered me a home. And what I learned there was, that any success I had was a direct result of the team of people that I work with. I know that two heads are better than one. I know that five heads are better than two.
DARCY O.S.:=>And I know that if we put our heads...
DARCY O.S.:=>...and our hearts into this company, we will deliver.
DARCY:=>Now, I love challenges, I love hard work. I look forward to sitting at this very table tossing ideas around until what I fear...
DARCY:=>...will be the wee hours of the morning, but most importantly, I want the work we do to say something about who we are...
HE'S MASTURBATING AND EJACULATES=>INTO NICK'S EYE WHO PLAYS ALONG WHICH

AND MORGAN RECOVERING. NICK:=>Excuse me.
DARCY:=>So, as our friends in Hollywood say, let's cut to the chase. How are we going to turn this company around? SHE LOOKS RIGHT AT NICK OS.
DARCY:=>When Sears decided to go after women in their advertising and said, "Come see the softer side of Sears", their revenues went up 30%.
DARCY:=>30%. That's huge.
DARCY O.S.:=>Female driven advertising...
DARCY:=>...totaled 40 billion dollars last year. And Sloane Curtis' share of that was...?
SHE LOOKS AROUND. DARCY:=>Zero.
OF TABLE L. DARCY:=>If you want to sell and anti-wrinkle cream or a Ford Mustang to a woman, forgive me... SHE TOUCHES DAN IN PASSING.
DARCY:=>...but this is the last place you're gonna bring your business. And we can't afford not to have a piece of a 40 billion dollar pie. So... SHE MOTIONS TO SOMEONE OSL.
DARCY O.S.:=>...I have put together a little kit...
DARCY:=>...for everybody. Nobody panic, this is supposed to be fun. SHE BEGINS UNLOADING BOXES.
DARCY O.S.:=>Every product in this box is looking for representation...

HE PUTS THEM DOWN. NICK:=>Okay, okay. I can do this. I'm a professional. HE COVERS HIS EYES AND REACHES INTO BOX PULLING OUT ITEM, THEN LOOKS.
NICK:=>Lipstick. All right. Lipstick on a guy's collar. No, no, women'll hate that. Lipstick on a guy's collar that won't rub off?
NICK:=>No, that's even worse. Okay, okay, okay. Think like a broad. All right. I'm a broad. I see lipstick and dark haired Tahitian beauty standing under a waterfall wearing nothing but a thong. Water cascading down her back...
HE CATCHES HIMSELF. NICK:=>I'm a lesbian. I got to change the music.
HE LOOKS AROUND. NICK:=>I wonder...I wonder... HE MOVES OSL.

NICK:=>No, no, that'd be north. And 1-2-3...
STUMBLES BACK SCREAMING AGAINST=>WALL.
NICK:=>Ow! Women are insane. Who would do that more than once?

ALEX:=>I can't believe you went through my stuff.
NICK:=>I was an emergency, I needed music. I was just sitting there.

POODLE :=>Monsieur, I need to poop!

ERIN :=>Oh, god! He nearly killed me. Too bad he missed.
HEARING HER LAST STATEMENT.=>HE PAUSES TO REFLECT BEFORE RUSHING OVER TO SECURITY KEYPAD ON WALL IN BG AND ENTERING CODE. HE THEN RUSHES THROUGH DOORS AND UP STEPS TO OFFICES IN BG.
TOWARDS HIM FROM BG. DINA:=>Morning.
DINA :=>Don't look up. He'll make me hear another disgusting joke. He's such a schmuck.
THIS REVELATION. NICK :=>She thinks I'm a schmuck?

NICK :=>Can't go. Can't go. Got to find a doctor. Need a cure. I can't go. Can't go.
MORGAN:=>You sound like the guy from "Shine". What's wrong with you?
NICK:=>Maybe I don't need a doctor. Maybe I need an exorcist. Under "X" no, under "E"?
NICK:=>...Loans...limos...locks...looms...
NICK O.S.:=>An exorcist expert, no..."E"...
MORGAN:=>There are no exorcists in the greater

ANNIE O.S.:=>By the way...

THOUGHTS. ANNIE O.S. :=>...to call my boyfriend in Israel.
ANNIE :=>For an hour.
NICK:=>Tell me you heard that.
MORGAN:=>Your hair looks really good. So what?
NICK:=>The other thing! The what she was thinking thing! 3AB -
NICK:=>I'll have you know she went to an Ivy League school, pal.
MORGAN:=>Doubt that.
NICK:=>Look, the other thing she said about the boyfriend, calling him in Israel, you heard that? Yes? No? HE COLLAPSES INTO HIS CHAIR AS MORGAN APPROACHES FROM AROUND DESK.
MORGAN:=>Dude, I didn't hear it because she didn't say it.
MORGAN:=>Now let's pull it together. We're gonna be late for our sorority meeting, okay? HE STARES OS AT NICK.
AROUND NERVOUSLY. NICK:=>Look, in case I maybe die today...
MORGAN:=>Can we walk and talk? 'Cause in case you live, I don't wanna be late, okay?
NICK O.S.:=>Okay, okay.
NICK:=>Here's what happened just in case the coroner asks, okay?
MORGAN:=>Uh-huh.
NICK:=>I got a little drunk last night and tried on all the products from the pink box.
MORGAN:=>You did not!
NICK:=>I put on all the products, okay? Nail polish, pantyhose, everything.
MORGAN:=>You tried on the pantyhose?
NICK:=>Yes! Yes! Okay, anyway, I was drying my hair and I fell over and tripped and fell into the bathtub and electrocuted myself and blacked out. And when I woke up, I could hear what every woman around me was thinking.
MORGAN GIVES HIM LOOK. MORGAN:=>Uh-huh? THEY PAUSE A MOMENT.
NICK:=>I'm talking personal, private stuff. The stuff that nobody on earth is supposed to hear, I hear tha stuff! You know what I'm saying, man? I can hear what women think.
MORGAN:=>Can you? Good, 'cause that's not a talent a lot of guys have these days.
NICK:=>Oh, you don't believe me, huh? You want me to prove it?
APPROACHING. NICK O.S.:=>See this attorney coming toward us?
MORGAN O.S.:=>Yeah.

MORGAN:=>Okay, okay. Just so we're on the same page here, I need you to know. HE MOVES AROUND IN FRONT OF NICK TO FACE HIM.
MORGAN:=>You sound insane.
MORGAN:=>You're freaked out over losing the job, which I understand...
MORGAN:=>...but if you tell anybody else that you can hear the inner most thoughts of a French poodle...
MORGAN INTO FG. ERIN O.S. :=>What if I just jumped out the window?
HER PASS INTO BG. ERIN :=>Would they notice? Probably not if I didn't get glass on anybody. HE TURNS BACK TO MORGAN IN OSFG.
NICK:=>The girl with the fruit's kinda funny. Suicidal, but she's funny.
MORGAN:=>Nick, what girl with the fruit?
DARCY :=>Last one to arrive. Wants me to know I'm not his boss.
DARCY :=>Okay, you're a star. I get the message.
NICK:=>She thinks I'm late because I want her to know she's not my boss, what is she talking about?
MORGAN PATS HIS HAND. MORGAN:=>Put a lid on it, buddy. I'm begging you.
DARCY SITTING IN BG. DARCY :=>Oh, I can't believe I have butterflies...
DARCY :=>...in my stomach. Fells like the first day of school.
DARCY IN BG. DARCY:=>Okay, so let's see how we did. SHE LOOKS AROUND AT GROUP.
DARCY :=>Nobody wants to go first. SHE LOOKS OSR.
ALSO AVOIDING EYE CONTACT. DARCY O.S. :=>Everyone's avoiding me.
SHE LOOKS AT CAMERA. DARCY :=>Except Nick Marshall.
DARCY :=>Unbelievable, the only one with good eye contact.

DARCY :=>...and not down my blouse.
INTO CAMERA. DARCY:=>So, Nick. What did you come up with?
NICK:=>Me?
DARCY O.S.:=>Mm-hmm.
HE NERVOUSLY SQUEEZES SQUISHY TOY. NICK:=>What did I come up with? Well...
ENERGY. DARCY :=>He's so wired.
RELAX. NICK:=>Mostly I thought about the moisturizing lipstick. Um...never having worn lipstick myself... HE GLANCES JOKINGLY OSR AT MORGAN.
NICK O.S.:=>...I tried to imagine...
NICK:=>...what I'd want from a lipstick you know, if I were a woman.
DINA :=>Urgh! Spare me. PAN L TO MCU ON DARCY NODDING.
DARCY :=>Okay, he's trying to be honest.
NICK:=>You know, to be perfectly honest, the first thing I thought of was a Tahitian beauty bathing under a waterfall...
NICK:=>...but, ah...you know, I'm working on it. Um, it's evolving. I don't suppose anybody's interested...
NICK O.S.:=>...in an idea involving the...
NICK:=>...Swedish bikini team. I do know them all personally. EVERYBODY CHUCKLES.
DINA :=>Of course you do. Oh, what an idiot.
HIM AND POINTING. GIRL :=>Grow up already.
TRUE THOUGHTS. WOMEN O.S. :=>- What a pig. - You are so foul.
WORRIED. DARCY :=>I should have asked for more money.
DARCY O.S.:=>Dina?
BEGINS HER IDEAS. DINA:=>I spent the night trying to figure out how to sell Advil...
DINA O.S.:=>...just to women.
SUE O.S. :=>You know what? We should sell it to women like me. HE PERKS UP AND FOCUSES ON HER.
DAYDREAMING. SUE :=>I take it every time I need to fake a headache. Works like a charm.
NICK:=>I got a great one!
DISCUSSING AS HE INTERRUPTS. NICK O.S.:=>It just came to me.
NICK:=>Do you mind if I interrupt, Dina?
DINA:=>No, sure. Go ahead.
DINA :=>I hate that you've seen me naked.
HER COMMENT BEFORE STANDING. NICK:=>All right.
NICK O.S.:=>So, we're in a bedroom, the lights are out, there's a woman in bed...
ROOM. NICK:=>...and she's taking an Advil. Her husband turns over and suggestively rubs her back...
NICK O.S.:=>...and we say...
NICK:=>..."Advil, so mild and gentle, you can take it even when you're faking a headache." EVERYONE CHUCKLES.
ON HER FACE. NICK O.S.:=>And then the woman turns to her husband and she says...
NICK:=>..."Oh, not tonight, dear, I need an Advil."
MORGAN :=>He's back.
NICK:=>What? Come on, that doesn't reach women on a personal level?
DISGUSTED. DINA:=>No.
NICK:=>Well, woman do that, don't they?
EMPHATICALLY RESPOND. WOMAN O.S. :=>- I don't do that! - Not me! - No.
NICK:=>Sue Cranston.
NICK O.S.:=>You've done that, haven't you?
HER. NICK:=>I mean, faked a headache to...you know... HE ROLLS HIS EYES SUGGESTIVELY.
SUE:=>No, Nick I haven't. But thanks for asking. SHE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY.
NICK:=>No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Be honest now. I mean, you've been married what, ten...
NICK O.S.:=>...twelve years? You've never in all...
NICK O.S.:=>...that time faked a headache?
NICK:=>It doesn't work like a charm?
SUE:=>No, Nick, I haven't. I mean...no. It doesn't okay? Jeeze!
HEEL INTO HIS SHOE. SUE O.S. :=>What an asshole.
NICK:=>Okay, I guess I'm way off base here.
IN FG. DARCY:=>Um, what's good about your idea...
DARCY O.S.:=>...is that you're looking at Advil from a woman's point of view. MORGAN NODS LIKE HE ACTUALLY CARES.
DARCY:=>Um, I don't think Advil will go for it and I'm pretty sure every woman in America will hate it. Other than that, I thought it was great. So you're on the right track. Hang in there.
TO DINA R. DARCY:=>Go ahead.
WHISPERS TO HIM. MORGAN:=>Great antenna there, babe. The poodle give you that one?
HERSELF TOGETHER. ALEX:=>What are you doing home so early?
NICK:=>I have my first migraine.
ALEX :=>This is hideous! My boyfriend feeling me up in front of my father!

CAMERON:=>Come on, man, relax.
NICK:=>How old are you?
CAMERON:=>I just turned 18.
NICK:=>Well, she's 15. She was 10 five years ago. You know what I'm saying, stud? Now get out.
ALEX:=>Dad!
ALEX :=>We're going to the prom. Don't ruin it.
NICK:=>You're not going to the prom with this punk.
ALEX:=>How did you know about the prom?
NICK:=>Look, I don't know. Mom told me, all right? But it's not gonna happen because he's too old for you and I know what boys his age want and he's not getting it from my daughter. Door. HE POINTS TO DOOR IN BG.
ALEX:=>Your daughter?
ALEX:=>Suddenly I'm your daughter?
ALEX :=>How am I related to this asshole?

NICK :=>You couldn't possibly do me a favor and think of your favorite color or TV program could you?
OPERATOR :=>For what city please? HE HANGS UP REALIZING IT'S A RECORDING.
NICK:=>Flo? Hey, Flo? Flo? HE LOOKS AROUND STREETS.
NICK:=>I can't believe this. I need a woman.
CLERK O.S.:=>Try this one.
FEMALE SHOPPER O.S.:=>Oh, I love this. This is fantastic. NICK RELUCTANTLY TURNS TO LOOK OSR.
FEMALE SHOPPER:=>Oh, it's my mother's birthday next week, so I need two gift sets...
WOMAN:=>...I appreciate it. Do you have a Kleenex back there so I can wipe that off?
CONFIDENT. CLERK O.S.:=>I'm sure she'll like it. It's one of our best sellers. HE TURNS TO LOOK.

DOORWAY. NICK:=>Doctor Perkins!
DR. PERKINS :=>Oh, Christ. Not him.
NICK:=>Oh good, you remember me.
NICK:=>I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I don't know who to turn to. I'm desperate.
NICK:=>I'm afraid to go to work. I'm afraid of my doorwoman. I'm afraid to get a cup of coffee.
HE SITS ON SOFA. DR. PERKINS:=>Mr. Marshall, please slow down.
NICK:=>Yes.
DR. PERKINS:=>Slow down. Let me make sure I completely understand what you're saying.
NICK:=>All right. All right. HE TURNS TO HER IN OSFG.
NICK:=>I hear what women think.
DR. PERKINS:=>Yeah, you know, Mr. Marshall, this kind of imaginary displacement scenario...
DR. PERKINS O.S.:=>...really isn't my thing.
NICK:=>I'm not imagining...
DR. PERKINS:=>I do however, have a very good friend over at University Hospital who specializes...
DR. PERKINS O.S.:=>...in male menopause and testosterone depletion...
DR. PERKINS:=>She's fabulous. I think what I'll do is just give her a ring and send you over
SHE SMILES WHILE WAITING. DR. PERKINS :=>Why did I answer my door? I was so into buying that lamp on Ebay.
NICK:=>How much was it going for?
DR. PERKINS:=>How much was what going for?
NICK:=>The lamp on Ebay.
DR. PERKINS:=>Oh, I see. That's good. Very clever.

NICK:=>No, go on. Pick a number. Give it a whirl. Any number. HE LAYS BACK ON SOFA.
DR. PERKINS:=>Okay, a number between one and...

NICK:=>Oh, you can say that again.
MOUTH. DR. PERKINS:=>I didn't say anything.
NICK O.S.:=>I know.
NICK:=>But that does not mean I didn't hear it!
MOVING TO FG. DR. PERKINS:=>Okay. Okay. Let's say I do believe you.
NICK:=>Yeah.
FG. DR. PERKINS:=>That you are...that you can hear what women think.

DR. PERKINS:=>But this is phenomenal! That you can hear inside my head!
NICK:=>Yeah.
DR. PERKINS:=>Why would you want to get rid of such a gift?
NICK:=>Well, for starters, almost every woman I know thinks I'm an asshole.
DR. PERKINS :=>That's what I thought when I first met you.
NICK:=>Doc, could you please give me a break here?
DR. PERKINS:=>Mr. Marshall, you might find this a little unorthodox, but would you mind if I smoked?
NICK:=>No, no, no. I understand.
DR. PERKINS:=>Let's try and look at the upside of this, shall we? You know, Freud died at age 83 still asking one question. What do women want? Wouldn't it be strange and wonderful If you were the one man on earth finally able to answer that question?
DR. PERKINS O.S.:=>Listen to me, Nick. Something extraordinary and miraculous has happened to you.
DR. PERKINS:=>My advice is...
DR. PERKINS O.S.:=>...you must learn from this.
SITS UP. DR. PERKINS:=>You know, there isn't a single woman that I treat that doesn't wish her ma understood her better. If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, than you speak Venusian.
DR. PERKINS O.S.:=>The world can be yours.
DR. PERKINS O.S.:=>I don't know how this happened to you or why, but you just may be the luckiest man

LOLA :=>Just don't hurt me, Nick. I've been hurt too many times.
NICK:=>I know how hard it is to go out with someone new.
NICK:=>I mean, there's always that fear of...
NICK:=>...well, getting hurt.
NICK:=>Well, at least that's how I feel inside.
LOLA:=>You do? Really?
NICK:=>All the time.
LOLA:=>Me too, all the time.
NICK:=>So...
NICK:=>...let's just take it slow and see how it goes.
LOLA:=>Slow is good. Slow is really good.
FEMALE LAWYER WALKING TOGETHER THROUGH OFFICES TO FG. MORGAN:=>So you don't think I'm gay. You're saying you never said that?

ANNIE O.S.:=>...some water? Or any kind of beverage?
NICK:=>No, but thank you. If I'm thirsty, I know where the coffee room is. HE TURNS AND MOVES TO STAIRS IN BG. ERIN IS KNEELING ON GROUND AT FOOT OF STAIRS PICKING UP SPILLED PAPERS AS GROUP OF MEN STROLL BY IGNORING HER AS NICK ARRIVES.
ERIN :=>That's right, guys, don't help. Just walk right past me. Why don't you just step on my hands you big... NICK HANDS HER ITEM FROM OSR.

DARCY:=>You're so right. How do you know that?
NICK:=>Well, you know, even I had a mother.

FROM WRITING. NICK:=>What?
DARCY:=>Ah...well, can I be honest with you?
NICK:=>Please do.
DARCY:=>Before I came here, I heard that you
NICK:=>well, I didn't know you were gonna be
DARCY:=>Sorry.
NICK:=>No, that's fine.
DARCY:=>Sorry...I...
NICK:=>Really...
NICK:=>...that's okay. You must have looked so forward to meeting me.
DARCY:=>I was dreading it. I had this whole
NICK:=>Well, since we're sharing. I heard a few things about you too.
DARCY:=>Oh, yes I'm sure. I'm the "Man eating
NICK:=>Ah...verbatim.
DARCY:=>Really? All right. Well, nice to meet
DARCY :=>But that's not who I am at all.

DARCY:=>Thank you. I appreciate that. See, no games equals embarrassing moment.

NICK:=>Yeah, I'm not buying it. What's going on?
DARCY:=>Well, I have an early meeting tomorrow with Dan and I wanted to make it later in the week so that I could be more prepared, but then I heard that you slipped in there and took the only time he had left, which left me with 8:15 tomorrow morning. It's fine, I'm just not as ready as I wish I was.
NICK:=>Sorry.
DARCY:=>Oh, listen, you didn't do it on purpose. I just don't want him to be disappointed. SHE COUGHS AND SIPS HER TEA.

DARCY:=>Really?
NICK:=>I insist. Unless you're too tired or something?
SHE YAWNS. DARCY:=>I'm not tired.
NICK:=>Yeah, I can see that.
DARCY:=>It's just so far beyond tired at this point. I've basically stopped sleeping ever since I took this job.
NICK:=>You have?
DARCY:=>Yeah. It's weird. I um...
DARCY :=>How do I say this?
NICK:=>You don't quite feel like yourself here, do you?
DARCY:=>No, I don't.
DARCY:=>Not yet anyway. Boy.
SHE BEGINS COLLECTING KLEENEXES. DARCY:=>Plus I'm mad that I'm getting sick. I never ever get sick. In fact, you don't have to sit so close to me if you don't want to. HE PULLS HER CHAIR CLOSER TO HIM.
NICK:=>Oh, come here. I'll brave it.
NICK:=>So, where do we kick off? Control-top panty hose. What do you say?
DARCY:=>Okay.
NICK:=>Personally, I think they do the trick.
DARCY:=>You've worn control-top pantyhose?
NICK:=>Did you put a pair in the pink box?
DARCY:=>Seriously?
NICK:=>Oh, yeah.
DARCY:=>You are full of surprises.
NICK:=>Yeah.
DARCY:=>No, no, no. I mean that as a compliment. I love that.

ALEX :=>Okay, this is it. Let me take a look. Yes,
ALEX O.S. :=>...I need boobs.
ALEX :=>Oh, I'll buy a padded bra when he's not around. Oh, I can't believe this is what I'll be wearing the last night I'm a virgin.
ALEX :=>Or should I say, what I'll be taking off. SHE TURNS BACK TO CAMERA TO LOOK.
NICK:=>Alex, I want to talk to you about something that's pretty important. I've never talked to you about this before but...
ALEX :=>Oh, God. He's actually gonna try to be a dad. This should be hilarious.
NICK:=>I realize I haven't been the perfect dad.

NICK O.S.:=>...to talk to you about, about... ALEX : About?
NICK O.S.:=>All right.
NICK:=>You're a young woman now and you may be flirting with the idea of...of...
ALEX:=>Having sex?
WAITER IN OSFG. ALEX:=>Um, can I get a lemonade please?
NICK:=>Well you know, boys and girls think very differently about sex. And my hunch is, that girls just want guys to hang out with them and like them.
NICK O.S.:=>Where as guys...
NICK:=>...and not all guys, all right? But most guys, they just pretty much want to have sex.
NICK:=>Okay.
NICK:=>What I'm trying to say here is, I don't want you to feel pressured...
NICK O.S.:=>...just because your boyfriend's older than you.
ALEX:=>Please. Save it.
ALEX O.S.:=>Mom had this talk with me when I was...
ALEX:=>...like eleven. I know you're supposed to have sex when you're in love and when it's special. I know everything. And mom knows me for real and knows my friends and knows Cameron, so let's leave the parental talks up to her, okay?
ALEX :=>Plus I promised Cameron...
ALEX O.S. :=>...I'd do it prom night.
NICK:=>Oh, jeeze.
ALEX:=>And also, let's not make me part of this Nick make-over, or whatever this new thing you're into is, okay?
NICK:=>What new thing?
ALEX:=>What new thing?
ALEX:=>This ridiculous new guy you're trying to be. Clowning around with me all of a sudden? Asking if we can make a salad together? Watch "Friends" together? I mean, it's nuts after fifteen years of no relating. I mean, come on. Who are you to
ALEX :=>'Cause you've never had a real relationship with anyone in your entire life.
ALEX O.S. :=>Look, I'm supposed to meet my friends.
ALEX:=>So, I'm gonna go, okay?

NICK :=>I..I just sensed it.
DARCY :=>Shit! I'm such an idiot. I didn't think he'd be there!
NICK :=>Excuse me?
DARCY :=>I didn't mean to really call you. I had your number here and I was thinking of you.
NICK :=>Oh, no that's all right. I was thinking about you too.
DARCY :=>Thinking of calling you.
DARCY :=>Obviously I did call you.
DARCY:=>Well, here's to another great idea.
NICK:=>What do you mean, let's meet for a drink?
DARCY:=>Yes. That's exactly what I wanted to say. Sometimes I think you're a bit of a mind reader.
NICK:=>But I don't have to be a mind reader with you because you always say what you think.
DARCY:=>I know, it's a curse.
NICK:=>What, are you kidding? It's a relief. An enormous relief. Do you know how rare that Is, to actually say what you think?
DARCY:=>Do you have any idea how rare it is for someone to actually like that about me? Trust me, this has not been a great thing in my life. My ex-husband didn't love me, let's put it that way.
NICK:=>He didn't love you?
DARCY :=>Did I just say that?
SHE COVERS HER FACE. DARCY:=>Oh, God! Um...I meant to say, it. He didn't love it.
DARCY:=>That I spoke my mind.
DARCY:=>If you want to know the truth, I'm not really sure he ever did really love, me.
NICK:=>Ooh.
DARCY:=>Yes, there's a conversation starter. God, a smart person would just get so very drunk now. THEY TOAST.
NICK:=>How long were you married?
DARCY:=>A little less than a year. I've been divorced about nine months now. We worked together, you know that, right?
NICK:=>Oh, yeah. I knew that. I heard it.
DARCY:=>Hmm.
NICK:=>What was that like?
DARCY:=>It was great in the beginning.
DARCY:=>Then it changed, became competitive.
DARCY:=>Suddenly, the better I did, the worse we did. The price I pay for being me. I know that now.
NICK:=>Oh...
DARCY:=>No, no, truly. No, no, it's true.
DARCY:=>Do you wanna know all this about me?
NICK:=>Keep going.
DARCY:=>Well, that's why I needed to get out there on my own, as scary as it was.

AROUND EXPLAINING TO HER. NICK:=>Yeah. The real reason I'm here is because...
NICK:=>I just sensed it.
NICK:=>...well, here's the thing, Erin. The real reason I'm here is because, as you know, we have the Nike account and we have a job opening in our team. And Darcy McGuire and I, we were just discussing, you know, really spitballing on who could be great enough to fill that void and suddenly your

DARCY:=>Okay.
AND PAUSE FACING. NICK:=>Thanks. So, you sleep here now?
DARCY:=>Well, I thought I might as well give it a try before I have to sell the place.
NICK:=>Sell it? You're not selling this place.
DARCY:=>Can't afford to keep it. I don't have a job.
NICK:=>You know, you ought to try returning some of your phone calls. You got your job back.
DARCY:=>Oh, do I? You're a real riot, you know that?
NICK:=>It's true. Dan told me so himself.
DARCY:=>Why would he tell you to do that? I didn't do the job that he hired me to do. Even I don't blame him for firing me.
DARCY:=>Look, I'm ah...well come on in. I don't have
NICK:=>What if I told you that you did everything that you were hired to do, but that someone was sabotaging you. Picking your brain, swiping your ideas and you never even know what hit you.
DARCY:=>How is that possible?
NICK:=>Oh, trust me. It's possible.
DARCY:=>Well, who would do such an awful thing?
NICK:=>I would.
NICK:=>I was a dope with...
NICK:=>... a corner office and when you came with the job I was supposed to have, I mean, it didn't matter that you were better at it than me, or you earned it more than I did. As Far as I was concerned, it was mine and I was gonna do anything I could to get it back. And so, I took advantage of you in the worst possible way.
NICK:=>Have you ever done that?
NICK:=>Taken the wrong road. No, of course you haven't. You wouldn't do that. It's just somebody like me does that. And ah, the problem with that was, that while I was digging a hole under you...
NICK:=>...I found out all about you.
NICK:=>And the more I found out, the more you dazzled me. I mean, shook my world, changed my life, dazzled me. And guys like your ex-husband of yours, I mean, he made you feel that the price that you pay for being you, is that you don't get to have love.
NICK:=>Isn't that what you were trying to say the other night? That you weren't complete. That you weren't really a winner like that?
NICK:=>Everything about you, how smart you are, how good you are, everything just makes me want you even more. Oh, boy. It sort of looks like I'm here at one in the morning being all heroic trying to rescue you, but the truth is, I'm the one that needs to be rescued here.
NICK:=>Sure wish I could read your mind .
DARCY:=>Well, I was thinking that um...if everything that you're saying is true, if I have my job back, then I think you're fired.
NICK:=>Well, I never really thought about it from that angle. Well, not that I don't deserve It. I...I...do. I'm stuttering.
TO LEAVE. NICK:=>Now I feel kind of embarrassed that I told you that I needed to be rescued. That's fine. THEY JUST STARE AT EACH OTHER.
STAIRS. DARCY O.S.:=>That's it? HE STOPS AND TURNS BACK TO LOOK.
NICK:=>I don't want that to be it. I don't want that to be it at all.
STAIRS. DARCY:=>Then don't let a little thing like me firing you stand in your way.
DARCY:=>I didn't know what to react to first. Hey, newsflash, I took the wrong road.
TOGETHER. DARCY:=>What kind of knight in shining armor would I be if the man I love needs rescuing and I just let him walk out my door?
KISS. NICK:=>My hero.
