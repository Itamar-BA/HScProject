JOHNNY=>Sorry!
MAN=>'Morning, Mr. Mason.
JOHNNY=>Good morning!
YOUNG LADY=>Hello, Johnny.
JOHNNY=>Lovely morning!
YOUNG MAN=>Hi, Johnny!
JOHNNY=>Beautiful morning!
STARTER=>'Morning, Mr. Mason.
JOHNNY=>Harry, it's a marvelous morning!
STARTER=>Have a good trip?
JOHNNY=>Sensational!
STARTER=>Great city, Boston!
JOHNNY=>Terrific!
EMPLOYEES=>Happy Bridegroom, yoo-hoo! Happy Bridegroom, yoo-hoo! Happy Bridegroom, Happy Bridegroom, Happy Bridegroom, yoo-hoo!
AD LIB=>A business trip. Huh?... Where's the little woman, Johnny -- why didn't you bring her along?... Is she one of the Lodges or one of the Cabots?... What's she got that I haven't got?... You'd better be careful with your expense account -- no extras now!... That's what you get for going out of town!... You old bluebeard, you!... I'm going to sue you for breach of promise!... Today our Johnny is a man!...
STENOGRAPHER=>Johnny, what's she like?
JOHNNY=>Now wait a minute! I can't describe her -- nobody could. But it just so happens I've got a picture of her.
CARTER=>Well, well, well!
JOHNNY=>Hello, Carter.
CARTER=>So you combined pleasure with business! Wait till Judge Doolittle hears about this, my boy!
JOHNNY=>Hears about what?
CARTER=>About your getting married on his time -- and without his consent -- Or his daughter's.
JOHNNY=>Well, what's she got to do about it?
CARTER=>Well, now, my boy -- the favorite topic of conversation around these parts has been that you and Miss Doolittle --
JOHNNY=>Aw, Malarkey! Office talk, Carter. Isn't a word of truth in it!
CARTER=>Judge Doolittle may not think so.
JOHNNY=>Is that so? Well, if he doesn't like it, he can lump it.
AD LIB=>You never asked me for my picture, Johnny. When's the next train leave for Boston?... Aren't I as pretty as that?... Johnny, has she got a sister?... No wonder we couldn't compete... I want one of them too!... I wish the boss'd send me out of town!... Never knew you had it in you, Johnny!...
DOOLITTLE'S VOICE=>Mason!
JOHNNY=>Oh, good morning, Judge Doolittle!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What's all this mess?
JOHNNY=>Ah -- Well, it seems everybody around here found out that I -- er -- I -- while I was in Boston --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What were you doing in Boston?
JOHNNY=>Why, you sent me sir. Don't you remember you sent me up there to get a deposition on the Higgins versus Higgins case!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Did you get it?
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Well, what's all this? What's all this horseplay about?
JOHNNY=>Well, while I was in Boston, after I got the deposition I had a few hours to spare and so I -- just a few hours -- and I --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Go on! Go on!
JOHNNY=>I got married!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>You WHAT?
JOHNNY=>I got married.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>You got married?
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir. I got married.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Come into my office!
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Where's the deposition?
JOHNNY=>There you are, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What's this?
JOHNNY=>Oh, that's -- that's just sort of a letter.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>So you got married?
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>I imagine this will be a surprise to some people.
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir! No, sir! I mean -- well -- I don't know. It all happened rather suddenly. You see, we met on Boston Common the night I arrived, and I'd had a bite at Thompson's Spa -- and then I took a little stroll around the Common and -- and I saw her standing there -- she was just standing there -- she had a cinder in her eye.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Where?
JOHNNY=>In her eye.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Whose eye?
JOHNNY=>Jane -- Mrs. Mason -- my wife.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Oh.
JOHNNY=>Of course, she wasn't my wife then -- she's my wife now, though. And I got the cinder out of her eye and --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>And you married her.
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Quick work, wasn't it?
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir. Oh Judge, we knew -- we knew the minute we looked at each other -- we knew -- we knew the minute we looked at each other.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>You did!
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Last year there were nearly a half a million divorces in this country. Congratulations, Mason!
JOHNNY=>Thank you very much, sir.
OFFICE BOY=>Mr. Hutch would like your opinion on this, sir. Oh, this is for you, Mr. Mason... special messenger. It's marked "Rush - Important."
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Rush? Important? What is it?
JOHNNY=>Oh, it's nothing.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What is it?
JOHNNY=>Oh -- it's a letter from my wife.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Your wife? What did you do -- leave her in Boston?
JOHNNY=>Oh, no. She's right here, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Here -- in town?
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>If your wife's in town, why did she write you a letter?
JOHNNY=>Well, she likes to write letters, Judge. Yes, it's a sort of little custom we have. She wrote me a letter the first day she met me, right as soon as she got home. She's written to me every day since. Even coming down on the train together she wrote me. You see, when I get a letter from her, it's sort of like a sort of visit, you see.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Hm -- mmm.
JOHNNY=>Judge -- we -- when two people get married, they usually go on a honeymoon.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>I didn't. I don't approve of honeymoons -- waste of time!
JOHNNY=>Uh -- huh. Well, you know how women are, and Mrs. Mason and I --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What about Higgins against Higgins? You're the only one in the office who knows this case and it's on the calendar for next week.
JOHNNY=>If I could get a continuance --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Opposing counsel wouldn't consent.
JOHNNY=>But I talked to Mr. Hornblow this morning and he agreed to a continuance.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Well, all right -- take a week.
JOHNNY=>A week! Well, Judge, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to make it in a week.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What?
JOHNNY=>We couldn't make it in a week!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Make what?
JOHNNY=>My wife and I had sort of planned a trip to Europe on the Normandie.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Oh, well -- take two weeks then.
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>And after I got the cinder out of Jane's eye we talked for a little while and then we took a little walk around the Common.
MRS. MASON=>Yes?
JOHNNY=>And -- er -- We walked for quite some time. And then we went over to Thompson's Spa for a bite --
MRS. MASON=>Yes?
JOHNNY=>And we had a bite.
MRS. MASON=>Well! Rather an unconventional meeting, wasn't it?
JANE=>These cookies are delicious!
MRS. MASON=>They're made with sour cream.
JOHNNY=>I'm crazy about Jane!
MRS. MASON=>John's so young and impulsive...
JOHNNY=>Oh, now Mother, wait a minute. This is different.
MRS. MASON=>Are you visiting relatives here in New York, my dear?
JOHNNY=>Well, yes and no. We -- Not exactly.
JANE=>I came over with Johnny.
MRS. MASON=>From Boston? Together? Last night?
JOHNNY=>Why, yes, Mother, we thought that as long as we were engaged --
MRS. MASON=>Engaged!
JANE=>Oh, I know how upset you must be, Mrs. Mason. You know so little about me -- and it all happened so suddenly --
MRS. MASON=>Well I should think it was sudden! What did your family have to say about it?
JANE=>I have no family.
MRS. MASON=>Oh. Didn't John say something about your taking a course in journalism?
JANE=>Yes, but I gave it up after I met Johnny.
JOHNNY=>Yes -- I'm sort of a post graduate course.
MRS. MASON=>Oh -- My dear, if you have a talent for writing -- Take my advice and develop it while you're young. One needs all one's time and energy for a career.
JANE=>Don't you think marriage is a career in itself?
MRS. MASON=>Oh, indeed! Emphatically! That's why one mustn't rush into it pell-mell. Marriage is a business -- a very serious business. A partnership in the strictest sense of the word. One must prepare for it. There are so many things to learn.
JOHNNY=>Well, Jane'll learn all of those -- after we're married.
MRS. MASON=>I hope and pray that that day will not come for many years!
JOHNNY=>Well, Mother -- What do you mean -- do you mean we shouldn't --
MRS. MASON=>Emphatically not! There's no reason for Jane to develop into a little household drudge. Oh, I hope you understand I have nothing against Jane. In fact, I like her -- I like her very much.
JOHNNY=>Well, I'm glad you do, Mother, because... You remember a little while ago you asked Jane whether she'd come to New York to visit relatives?
JOHNNY=>Well, as a matter of fact, she has come to New York to visit relatives. She's visiting some right now -- you see --
JANE=>We're married.
MRS. MASON=>Ohhhh --
JOHNNY=>Now, Mother -- everybody gets married sooner or later --
JANE=>Johnny, get the smelling salts!
JOHNNY=>What do they look like? Mother, where are the smelling salts?
MRS. MASON=>Ohhhh... What's done is done. You'll have children of your own, I suppose.
MRS. MASON=>And you'll love them and devote your life to them, and then they'll grow up and leave you and you'll say to yourself, it's all right, that's the way it is, you've served your purpose.
JOHNNY=>Oh, Mother, don't excite yourself any more.
MRS. MASON=>Oh, I'm all right now.
MRS. MASON=>I wish you every possible happiness and joy. I think perhaps I'd better go to bed. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'll find a place to live, of course.
JOHNNY=>Some place to live! Well, of course not Mother, you'll stay with us. We're, well, we're going to find a new apartment. We've talked this over and Jane'll insist. Won't you, darling?
JANE=>Why, we couldn't think of anything else.
MRS. MASON=>Well, we'll see.
JOHNNY=>Well, you see, I told you it would be all right.
JANE=>Oh, Johnny, maybe we shouldn't have gotten married. Maybe we shouldn't have gotten married at all.
STEWARD=>All visitors ashore, please! All visitors ashore, please!
MRS. MASON=>Don't let him eat too many strawberries.
JANE=>I won't.
MRS. MASON=>He gets rashes. And don't forget to make him wear his raincoat in London.
JANE=>I won't.
MRS. MASON=>He had pneumonia once.
JOHNNY=>Oh, Mother, that was twelve years ago. I feel fine now.
MRS. MASON=>And take good care of yourself, too.
JANE=>Goodbye, Mrs. Mason.
MRS. MASON=>Take good care of him.
JOHNNY=>Goodbye, Mother. Aw now, Mother -- it's only two weeks, you know.
MRS. MASON=>I know -- Goodbye.
JOHNNY=>Goodbye.
MRS. MASON=>Oh.
JOHNNY=>What's this?
MRS. MASON=>The heating pad. You forgot to pack it.
JOHNNY=>Here it is.
JOHNNY=>Ah, what do you think of it?
JANE=>Well, it's -- it's cozy.
JOHNNY=>It's the only one they had left. I think we can do better after the boat sails.
JANE=>Oh, what for? I love it. It's so intimate.
JANE=>What's this?
JOHNNY=>Oh that! -- that's nothing --
JANE=>Is it something somebody gave you? Oh, I know it's for me. Let me see it!
JOHNNY=>Oh, no -- no, it isn't.
JANE=>It is too. Let me see it!
JOHNNY=>But it's just something I forgot to pack.
JANE=>Well, what are you being so mysterious about? Let me see it.
JOHNNY=>It's nothing...
JANE=>I bet it's a going away present.
JANE'S VOICE=>Oh, Johnny, you shouldn't have done this.
JANE=>Oh, Johnny, you fool!
JOHNNY=>Well, gee whizz, I couldn't leave it in the office!
JOHNNY=>Jane --
JANE=>What?
JOHNNY=>You know, when I was in school I was taught that two things can't occupy the same place at the same time.
JANE=>What? Oh.
JANE=>Well, we'll get the steward to get us a bigger bed.
JOHNNY=>You couldn't get a bigger bed in here though.
JANE=>Oh, I think it's big enough.
JOHNNY=>Wait till you try to turn around. Is it all right?
JANE=>Sure it is.
JOHNNY=>Let's see. That's not so bad. Why there's oceans of room here.
JANE=>Johnny, this is the first time in my life I've ever been away from America.
JOHNNY=>Me, too.
JANE=>Isn't it just beautiful?
JOHNNY=>Yeh, yeh, I guess so -- Jane...
JANE=>What, Johnny?
JOHNNY=>Do you remember that cinder I took out of your eye in Boston?
JANE=>I'll never forget it.
JOHNNY=>Do you know that I threw it away? I shouldn't have done that. I should have kept that cinder -- put it in a locket or something. If it hadn't been for that cinder, maybe we'd never have met...
JANE=>Don't say that, Johnny -- we had to meet.
JOHNNY=>Yeh, yeh, I guess you're right. But still... if it hadn't been for that cinder --
JANE=>Oh, Johnny -- isn't it just beautiful?
JANE=>Bon voyage, darling.
JOHNNY=>Bon voyage.
CARTER'S VOICE=>Where is stateroom 504?
STEWARD=>First room to your left, sir.
JOHNNY=>Come in.
JOHNNY=>Well, hello, Carter. Nice of you to come down.
CARTER=>Judge Doolittle sent me.
JOHNNY=>He did?
JOHNNY=>Carter, this is Miss -- Mrs. -- This is my wife. Darling, this is Mr. Carter from the office.
JANE=>How do you do?
CARTER=>Happy to know you. It's a good thing I got here in time. You've got just ten minutes.
JOHNNY=>Ten minutes for what?
CARTER=>To get off the boat.
JOHNNY=>To get off the -- What're you talking about?
CARTER=>Higgins against Higgins.
JOHNNY=>What about Higgins against Higgins?
CARTER=>Higgins against Higgins goes on the calendar for next week.
JOHNNY=>Oh, no, no. That's where you're mistaken. I got a continuance for a whole month.
CARTER=>You think you did.
JOHNNY=>I did! Why didn't you ask Hornblow about it? He gave me his word of honor.
CARTER=>Well, you know Hornblow.
JANE=>Johnny, they can't do this to you!
JOHNNY=>No, they can't do this to me!
JANE=>What does Doolittle think he is -- a puppet?
JOHNNY=>What does he think I am -- a puppet or something?
JANE=>Some kind of a pawn he can push around any way he likes?
JOHNNY=>Yes -- push all over the place?
CARTER=>Is that what you want me to tell Doolittle?
JANE=>Yes!
JOHNNY=>Oh, Carter, wait a minute! Are you sure that Higgins case is going on next week?
CARTER=>Monday morning at nine o'clock.
JOHNNY=>Will you excuse us a minute? -- Jane --
JANE=>I'm glad you said that, Johnny.
JOHNNY=>Yeah -- yeah - Jane, look -- This Higgins versus Higgins is a pretty important case.
JANE=>I don't care if it's the most important case in the world -- it isn't as important as our honeymoon, is it?
JOHNNY=>Oh, no -- of course not, darling. But what's the matter?
JANE=>You've got lipstick all over your mouth.
JOHNNY=>A lawyer is sort of like a doctor or a soldier -- you -- you've got to disregard your own convenience.
JANE=>Convenience! You don't call this a convenience!
JOHNNY=>No, no darling -- now listen, darling, believe me I'd tell Doolittle to jump in the lake -- even at the risk of losing my job, but if I win this case -- I have a chance to get into the firm. And -- And a firm like this --
JOHNNY=>But it's my honeymoon! And Doolittle knows it's my honeymoon!
JOHNNY=>There are just some things a man just can't do. There are some things a man just can't do!
JANE=>That Carter thought it was funny! He laughed! Oh, I hate that -- that liver-pill!
JOHNNY=>If they ever try pulling anything like this again, I...
JANE=>And I hate that Judge Do-nothing. I -- I wish someone would step on that ear-thing of his.
JOHNNY=>Well, we still have the tickets here...
JANE=>And I hope Higgins beats Higgins! Oh, Johnny --
MRS. MASON=>The alligator pears, Annie.
JANE'S VOICE=>Johnny!
ANNIE=>It's your mother-in-law.
JANE'S VOICE=>Oh, hello, dear!
JANE'S VOICE=>Oh, would you mind fixing the place cards for me? I'm so late. They're right in there on the desk.
MRS. MASON=>Certainly, dear.
JANE'S VOICE=>That girl took so long to fix my hair, I didn't get out of the place till half past six. It's still sopping wet.
MRS. MASON=>You should have made an earlier appointment.
JANE=>Yes, I should. I thought I'd put Judge Doolittle on my right, of course.
MRS. MASON=>Naturally.
JANE=>And Mr. Carter -- I suppose I'll have to have him on my left.
MRS. MASON=>You seem to think I've never done this before.
JANE=>No, no dear. It's just that I never have.
MRS. MASON=>You have the wine glasses on the wrong side, Annie.
ANNIE=>The left side was the right side where I worked before.
MRS. MASON=>The right side was the water glasses, Annie.
JANE=>How do you think the table looks?
MRS. MASON=>Isn't it a little crowded?
JANE=>Oh, that girl will drive me crazy!
JANE=>The things that pop up at the last minute! I had to borrow some finger bowls from the woman downstairs because we only had four. Oh -- are you at Johnny's right?
MRS. MASON=>I always have been.
JANE=>I thought tonight I'd put Miss Doolittle there.
MRS. MASON=>Oh well, of course, it's your party, my dear.
JANE=>Just this once. Do you mind?
MRS. MASON=>Certainly not. You know, I thought at one time that John and Eunice Doolittle --
JANE=>Yes?
MRS. MASON=>But there was nothing in it... But a lovely girl!
JANE=>Would you be a dear and see if Annie has the appetizers fixed?
MRS. MASON=>Of course, dear.
MRS. MASON=>I think you have too many on the plate, Annie. And shouldn't they be garnished? Where's the silver tray -- the one I gave them?
ANNIE=>I don't know how many hands they expect you to have in this place! There's just so much a body can do! I'm only human.
MRS. MASON=>I'll fix the canapes for you, Annie, since you seem to have so much to do. A little too much vinegar in your salad dressing, Annie, I'm afraid.
ANNIE=>I'm only human.
MRS. MASON=>Oh, your potatoes aren't going to burn, are they? I'm afraid you put them on too early.
ANNIE=>I'm leavin'.
JANE=>You're WHAT?
ANNIE=>Right now. You can stand just so much. I'm only human.
JANE=>But you can't do that! What's the matter?
ANNIE=>I can't please everybody.
JANE=>Oh... But, Annie -- my guests will be here any minute!
ANNIE=>Well, I'll see you through dinner, but I'm leaving at nine o'clock sharp to catch the nine-thirty fairy boat to Staten Island -- an' nobody's goin' to stop me!
ANNIE=>I'm only human.
MRS. MASON=>Watch the potatoes, Annie!
JANE=>Dear, Annie has so much to do -- the extra guests and everything -- Don't you think we'd better humor her tonight -- sort of leave her alone...
MRS. MASON=>You asked me to see about the canapes --
JANE=>I know -- but it's a great deal for one person to do. And too many of us telling her what to do only upsets her.
MRS. MASON=>Well -- I was only trying to help.
JANE=>There's Johnny!
JANE=>I bet you forgot the wine!
JOHNNY=>Old Granite Puss's favorite brand! I called up Doolittle's club and found out -- Pretty nice, huh? It's Burgundy and it sparkles! Tell Annie to chill it, Mother. They'll be here any minute! You'd better get dressed!
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>How's everything going?
JANE=>Everything's lovely! An ultimatum from Annie and this one's final!
JANE=>She's through tonight.
JOHNNY=>Tonight!
JANE=>It's all right. She'll see us through dinner.
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>I don't see why you have so much trouble with servants. Down at the office we get all the help we want.
JANE=>I'd like to change places with you for just one day.
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>Jane, for Pete's sake, what did you do with the witch hazel?
JANE=>I didn't have it. Look on the third shelf back of the eye wash.
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>Always putting things behind things...
JANE=>That was a brilliant idea of yours, asking Eunice Doolittle at the last minute!
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>She and the judge are like corned beef and cabbage. They're always together.
JANE=>And that impossible twirp, Carter -- I suppose you had to ask him, too!
JOHNNY=>Eunice had some sort of date with Carter. What could I do? I not only do all that guy's work, for him, but feed him as well. It's all going to be different when my name goes up on that door.
JANE=>Oh, Johnny -- do you really think so?
JOHNNY=>It's practically up there now. What's for dinner tonight?
JANE=>Roast beef.
JOHNNY=>Roast beef! Doolittle's delight.
JANE=>You know, I tried to have Annie make Yorkshire pudding -- but she never heard of it.
JOHNNY=>Oh, that's all right. Between roast beef and Higgins against Higgins how can we lose? Yes, sir, that's going to be all right -- my name up there on the door.
JOHNNY=>Doolittle --
JANE=>Messerschmidt --
JOHNNY=>Doolittle --
JANE=>Hutch --
JOHNNY=>and Mason!
JANE=>Oh, Johnny!
JOHNNY=>Well, didn't I win my motion for a new trial in Higgins against Higgins? I had a memo from Doolittle today.
JANE=>Oh, you did. What did he say?
JOHNNY=>He said he couldn't have handled it better himself. And when he eats from your table tonight, he'll eat out of my hand. And will I tell Carter!
JANE=>And will we hop the Normandie!
JOHNNY=>And will we go places!
JANE=>And will we do things! Darling, I don't like that tie. Wear the blue one.
JOHNNY=>Holy Mackerel.
JANE=>Johnny, does your name have to be last?
JOHNNY=>Well, for the time being anyway. You know what it means to a man to get into a firm like that?
JANE=>You know what it means to a firm to get a man like you in it? Here, hook me up.
JOHNNY=>Pretty nice neck you've got there.
JANE=>As nice as Eunice Doolittle's?
JOHNNY=>What do I know about Eunice Doolittle's neck? I never even noticed she had one. Hey, do you know what time it is? Get dressed, will you?
JANE=>I am dressed.
JOHNNY=>Come on then! Old Granite Puss will be here any minute.
DOOLITTLE'S VOICE=>Good evening.
JOHNNY=>Good evening, Judge. I've got great news for you tonight, Judge. We're having roast beef. Roast beef for dinner, yeah.
JANE=>Would you care for some more wine, Judge Doolittle?
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Yes. Thank you.
JANE=>Annie -- more wine for Judge Doolittle.
ANNIE=>There ain't any more.
JANE=>A salad fork for Judge Doolittle, Annie!
ANNIE=>I put one there.
JANE=>Funniest thing happened to me the other day, Judge Doolittle -- I ran across the year book of my husband's class at college, and in the class prophecy he was picked out as the one most likely to succeed.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What's that?
JANE=>The other day I ran across the year book of my husband's class at college, and in the class prophecy --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Oh, yes, yes -- yes.
JANE=>Higgins against Higgins was quite an important case, wasn't it, Judge Doolittle?
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>We like to think all our cases are important. The little client of today may be the big client of tomorrow.
CARTER=>Oh, you're so right, Judge.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>For instance, we got a client the other day...
JANE=>Oh dear -- What happened to your ice cream, Annie?
ANNIE=>I told you to have the ice box fixed.
JANE=>Annie, give this note to Mr. Mason.
JANE=>Is it true, Judge Doolittle, something new is going to happen in the firm this week?
JOHNNY=>Excuse me.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What?
JOHNNY=>Excuse me, please?
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Oh yes -- we're going to have a blood transfusion... I'm only speaking metaphorically of course. What I mean is we're getting some new blood into the firm -- appointing a junior partner.
JANE=>Oh!
JOHNNY=>You couldn't stay and serve the coffee, could you Annie?
ANNIE=>No!
JOHNNY=>Here's seven dollars -- and I'll send you --
ANNIE=>I want my twelve dollars now!
JOHNNY=>All right, Annie -- all right. I'll get it for you. I'll get it -- maybe.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>That's how to keep an old firm young. I've been doing this every five years and it's quite a job to pick the right man.
JANE=>Johnny --
JOHNNY=>Excuse me --
MRS. MASON=>I shouldn't think so. Surely it's a question of merit --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>As a rule I always trust my own judgment, but when it comes to picking men --
JANE=>Johnny --
JOHNNY=>Excuse me --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>...I think there's nothing like a woman's intuition.
CARTER=>Oh, you're so right, Judge.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Of course, Eunice doesn't know much about law -- but she's traveled all over the world and she does know people. Five years ago it was at her suggestion that I took Mr. Hutch into the firm. It worked out so well...
JOHNNY=>I beg your pardon -- I'm very sorry...
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>...that this year I have again consulted my daughter. And now a new name moves up on the door of our offices. Beginning next Monday, the name of the firm will be -- Doolittle --
DOOLITTLE'S VOICE=>Messerschmidt -- Doolittle -- Hutch -- and Carter.
JOHNNY=>Well, Carter -- Congratulations! It's wonderful. I always knew you had it in you... I'd like to propose a toast to the new partner -- only -- we -- seem to have run out of -- wine. There isn't any more wine.
JANE=>May I have some paper and an envelope, please?
NURSE=>Certainly.
JANE=>Thank you.
NURSE=>Would you like a stamp?
JANE=>No thank you.
JANE=>Could I have a safety pin, please?
NURSE'S VOICE=>Surely.
JANE=>Thank you.
JOHNNY=>And I tell you, gentlemen of the jury, the defendant Higgins, with unbrotherly venom and motivated solely by a desire maliciously and hatefully to interfere with his brother's rights and privileges --
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>-- deliberately and improperly diverted the waters of the stream --
JOHNNY=>Well, gentlemen, I leave the determination of these matters in your hands, confident that your verdict will bring justice to my client, the plaintiff in this action.
JUDGE=>Gentlemen of the jury --
JUDGE'S VOICE=>You will now retire to arrive at a verdict.
JANE=>I came in just as you started your summation, Johnny -- it was wonderful!
JOHNNY=>You should have been here when I cross-examined Higgins.
JANE=>Your Higgins?
JOHNNY=>No -- the other one.
MAN=>You skinned him alive.
JOHNNY=>I tore him apart! I really cut him up --
JANE=>Johnny --
JOHNNY=>Jane!
FIRST MAN=>Congratulations, Mason!
SECOND MAN=>Good work!
THIRD MAN=>You did a swell job!
JOHNNY=>Is it -- happening?
NURSE=>It's happening.
JOHNNY=>Why didn't they wake me? I want to be with her -- I've got a right to be with my wife, haven't I?
NURSE=>All right. Wait a minute. You can't go in there until you put this on.
OBSTETRICIAN=>Come on -- you can do better than that.
OBSTETRICIAN'S VOICE=>Atta boy!
CASHIER'S VOICE=>Now he's all yours, Mr. Mason.
JOHNNY=>All mine.
CASHIER=>Come in again some time.
JOHNNY=>Thank you -- I will. I mean I -- yeah.
COP=>Hey! What do you think you're doing holding up traffic?
COP=>Oh... What is it, boy or girl?
JANE=>What do you think?
COP=>Hey, cut that out! Do you want to wake that baby! All right -- get going.
JANE=>Johnny?
JOHNNY=>Uh huh --
JANE=>Like him?
JOHNNY=>Sort of.
JANE=>Don't you think he's... he's just beautiful?
JOHNNY=>He... he looks old, don't you think?
JANE=>Old? What do you mean, old?
JOHNNY=>I mean... he looks as though he were six months old -- or a year -- at least.
JANE=>Oh, Johnny, you're silly... but don't you think he's just beautiful?
JOHNNY=>I hope he grows up to look like you.
JANE=>How can he? He has all your features.
JOHNNY=>I don't see how you can tell that by looking at that face.
JANE'S VOICE=>Just look at the way his eyes crinkle... Just the way yours do when you're happy.
JOHNNY=>He doesn't look happy. He looks kind of bored.
JANE=>Well, you'd be bored too, if you'd been through what he has... But don't you think he's just beautiful?
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>Boy, what a grip!
JANE=>But don't you think he's just beautiful!
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>Well, fella, how do you like your first bath?
MRS. MASON=>Be sure you soap his head thoroughly. It prevents cradle-cap.
JANE=>Yes, Mother. I know.
MRS. MASON=>Ittie Johnny doesn't want nasty old cradle-cap, does oo?
JOHNNY=>Look at those shoulders! Can I do something Jane? Please!
JANE=>Now look what you've done! I almost dropped him! Do move over, Johnny -- please!
MRS. MASON=>If you'd let me show you how --
JANE=>I know how. They showed me at the hospital.
MRS. MASON=>You don't rub the baby dry. You just pat him.
JANE=>I am patting him.
MRS. MASON=>He looks red. Maybe the water was too hot.
JANE=>No, Mother. It was just right. I tested it.
MRS. MASON=>Was its 'ittle water too hot for ittie Johnny?
JANE=>Johnny, will you hand me his shirt?
JANE=>Not that one! This one.
JOHNNY=>Look at the chest on him! Can't I help?
MRS. MASON=>Be careful of his little head, my dear.
JANE=>I will, Mother. Johnny, you'd better go in the kitchen and warm his milk.
MRS. MASON=>Not too hot, John!
JANE=>Hallelujah! He's bathed!
MRS. MASON=>A touch of colic.
JANE=>No, Mother, he's just hungry.
MRS. MASON=>I'm sorry, my dear, but it's colic... He's been crying for five minutes.
JANE=>Johnny! Where's that bottle!
JOHNNY=>Here, fella -- the feed bag!
JANE=>They don't eat with their hands, you dope!
JANE=>You see Mother, he was hungry.
MRS. MASON=>If he were fed on time he wouldn't cry.
JANE=>As soon as we're organized...
MRS. MASON=>Too bad he has to be fed on a bottle.
JANE=>I haven't heard the baby complain yet.
MRS. MASON=>John never saw a bottle till he was six months old.
JANE=>I won't say anything. I won't say anything. I won't say anything...
MRS. MASON'S VOICE=>What's that, my dear?
JOHNNY=>What do you think? It's a present from old Granite Puss...
JANE=>I'll bet it's a summons.
JOHNNY=>No -- it's a bank book.
JOHNNY=>He's deposited Ten Dollars.
JOHNNY=>Say -- that's a lot of money for the little guy.
JANE=>I hope it doesn't plunge Doolittle into bankruptcy.
JOHNNY=>After that hospital bill he's got more cash in the bank than I have.
MRS. MASON=>I think it's very considerate of Judge Doolittle to think about the baby's future.
JANE=>I'm not worried about his future -- It's the present that bothers me... Where are we going to put him?
JOHNNY=>Why can't he stay in our room?
JANE=>You know he kept you awake last night.
MRS. MASON=>You should have taken that into consideration, my dear, before you rented this apartment.
JANE=>I know. I should have.
MRS. MASON=>If my own room weren't so small --
JANE=>Oh, I wouldn't think of it, dear.
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>We could keep him in our room days and in the living room nights.
JANE'S VOICE=>That's too far from the bedroom.
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>Well, in the dining room, then.
JANE'S VOICE=>It's too near the kitchen -- but I suppose we'll have to.
HILDA=>Mrs. --
JANE'S VOICE=>Yes, Hilda?
HILDA=>Could I please see you a minute?
JANE=>What is it, Hilda?
HILDA=>Your mother-in-law hired me when you was away -- but she didn't say why you was away --
JANE=>You mean you don't approve of my having a baby?
HILDA=>That's your business. You can have as many babies as you like.
JANE=>Thank you. That's big of you.
HILDA=>But my business is cooking. You get somebody else to wash the diapers.
JANE=>You're -- you're fired!
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>Don't you worry, Johnny --
JANE=>I wish I could go back to the hospital.
JOHNNY=>As soon as the lease is up we'll get a house in the country with a room all your own -- and a garden to ride your bicycle in, and -- Look! Mother! Jane! Look -- the baby! He's smiling -- he's smiling at me!
MRS. MASON=>That's gas!
JANE=>How was it, Johnny?
JOHNNY=>Oh, swell.
JANE=>Who was there?
JOHNNY=>Oh, just the same old crowd, only ten years older.
JANE=>Who spoke, Johnny?
JOHNNY=>Ed O'Malley made quite a speech -- all about how he bought that seat on the stock exchange. And then Joe Kendall -- just got back from opening up a London office --
JANE=>Did you make a speech?
JOHNNY=>Yeah.
JANE=>What did you say?
JOHNNY=>You know -- the things you have to say at a reunion. Nothing much.
JANE=>What did you say, Johnny?
JOHNNY=>Well, my speech was pretty short. What would I have to say? The man most likely to succeed.
JANE=>Well, I think you have and I bet your speech was swell. Did you tell them that funny story you told me yesterday?
JOHNNY=>No -- no, I didn't think of it. All I could think of was my achievements -- What I've accomplished and how far I've gone. I suppose I should have told them how I used your money -- all of it -- to buy the furniture for this apartment.
JANE=>Now, that's silly. Your money -- my money -- what's the difference? It wasn't much anyway.
JOHNNY=>I should have told them how the baby has to sleep in the dining room --
JANE=>Well, what of it? And it's only temporary -- till we get a new apartment --
JOHNNY=>-- because I can't afford to get you a decent place to live --
JANE=>Stop it! Don't say those things! Sometimes I get so mad at you I can't see straight.
JOHNNY=>Sometimes I get so mad at myself I can't see at all!
JANE=>I know what happened -- the dinner disagreed with you. What did you have?
JOHNNY=>I don't know -- I didn't eat any of it.
JANE=>Now I know what's wrong -- you're hungry! C'mon, honey, I'll get you something out of the ice box.
JANE=>Now let's see. Here's some cheese you like. And a whole cold chicken staring us right in the face. Which?
JOHNNY=>Chicken.
JANE=>The trouble with you is you let people step on you! You do all the work in that office... Coffee?
JOHNNY=>No. Milk.
JANE=>You've forgotten more about law than Carter'll ever know. How do you expect people to recognize your value if you don't recognize it yourself?... White or rye?
JOHNNY=>Rye.
JANE=>They couldn't get along without you for one minute -- and you know it! Everybody knows it!
JOHNNY=>Everybody but Doolittle.
JANE=>He knows it too! But he takes advantage of you. I told you when he promoted Carter over your head that you should have quit -- walk right out on him!
JOHNNY=>Now, Jane, how could I? What about --
JANE=>I know -- your mother and I. I wish you'd forget about us.
JOHNNY=>If I lost my job --
JANE=>But you wouldn't! They'd never let you go! You're far too valuable! If you left, Doolittle would crawl to you on his hands and knees and beg you to come back.
JOHNNY=>On his hands and knees! You don't know Doolittle.
JANE=>I know you! All you've got to do is speak up -- stand right up to Doolittle! Don't ask for your rights -- demand them!
JOHNNY=>Remember the day in Boston when I got you this ring -- I promised to get you a better one later?
JANE=>I don't want a better one later.
JOHNNY=>You liked the platinum one with the diamonds.
JANE=>That can wait.
JOHNNY=>And the mink coat can wait too, I suppose. Probably in about three hundred years I can afford to buy you one.
JANE=>What are you -- a man or a mouse?
JOHNNY=>A mouse!
JANE=>John Mason, you know what's the matter with you? You're too modest. You don't appreciate yourself... I do want that platinum ring! And I want a fur coat -- not the mink -- but a fur coat! And I want a honeymoon on the Normandie! And I want an apartment that's big enough for your mother and the baby -- so the baby wouldn't have to sleep in the dining room! You can get them for me! You can get everything I want -- everything that's coming to me! But first you've got to get what's coming to you!
JOHNNY=>If I only knew how to go about it --
JANE=>It's easy.
JOHNNY=>You think it's easy.
JANE=>You just walk right into the office and you say --
JOHNNY=>Jane, you don't walk into Judge Doolittle's office. He sends for you.
JANE=>Well, this time you walk in. You go right up to him and you say: "Judge Doolittle, there's something I've got to say to you right now."
JOHNNY=>You can't talk to him like that though.
JANE=>Have you ever tried?
JOHNNY=>Now Jane, you don't understand. If I barged in there like that he'd -- he'd --
JANE=>He'd say -- "What is it Mason? Sit down."
JOHNNY=>He never asked me to sit down in his life.
JANE=>Well then stand up. But don't let him interrupt you. Speak your piece.
JOHNNY=>Yeah -- well now that -- speak your piece. It's easy to do here in the kitchen. You get downtown...
JANE=>Well, downtown or uptown, what difference does it make? You're not asking a favor of him. You're demanding your rights. He'll listen. Make him listen.
JOHNNY=>All right -- okay -- all right -- what'll I say?
JANE=>You'll say --
JANE=>"Judge Doolittle, I've been working for you now for five years and I've given you everything that's in me -- every ounce."
JOHNNY=>Well, all right -- what'll he say?
JANE=>There's no doubt about it, Mason. I've never questioned your ability or your loyalty --
JOHNNY=>And I'll say --
JANE=>Judge Doolittle -- what're you going to do about it?
JOHNNY=>I hate to think what he'll say!
JANE=>He'll say: Mason, what do you expect me to do? And you'll say: The right thing, Judge Doolittle... I want more money and I want to be taken into the firm! And he'll say:
JOHNNY=>He'll say plenty!
JANE=>No matter what he'll say -- you'll say:
JANE=>Judge Doolittle, I either get a raise and a junior partnership or else -- Or else you can accept my resignation, effective immediately.
JOHNNY=>Effective immediately. That's all right, Jane. That's a good idea. I'm going through with it -- one of these days.
JANE=>One of these days is tomorrow.
JOHNNY=>Tomorrow?
JANE=>Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.
JOHNNY=>Well -- if you think I should!
JANE=>There's no time like the present.
JOHNNY=>Let's start at the beginning, Jane. I'll walk into his office and I'll say --
JANE=>Judge Doolittle, there's something I've got to say to you right now!
JOHNNY=>Judge Doolittle, there's something I've got to say to you right now!
JANE=>Either I get a raise and a junior partnership --
JOHNNY=>Either I get a raise and a junior partnership --
JANE=>Or you can accept my resignation --
JOHNNY=>Or you can accept my resignation -- Effective immediately.
JANE=>Effective immediately!
JOHNNY=>Not bad.
JOHNNY=>I've been working in this office for the last five years and there's something I want to tell you right now -- Either I get a raise and a junior partnership -- Or else...
JANE=>Or else --
JOHNNY=>...a raise and a junior partnership -- or else...
BOOKKEEPER=>Judge Doolittle is in.
JOHNNY=>Okay!
JOHNNY=>-- Or else you can accept my resignation -- effective immediately.
CARTER=>What is it, a jury case?
JOHNNY=>Now, never mind. I'm thinking.
CARTER=>Here are the papers in City against Consolidated.
CARTER=>I want you to drop over to Consolidated and see their accountants.
JOHNNY=>Okay.
OFFICE BOY=>Pssst! He just got in.
JOHNNY=>Okay -- okay.
DOOLITTLE'S VOICE=>Come in!
JOHNNY=>Judge Doolittle, there's something I've got to say to you right now --
JOHNNY=>Judge Doolittle -- I've been working in this office --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Oh, it's you! You're just the one I wanted to see. Sit down.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Mason --
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir?
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>You've been doing mighty good work lately.
JOHNNY=>Thank you, Judge.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>You've been capable, dependable and loyal -- right from the start!
JOHNNY=>That's mighty nice of you, Judge!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>But, Mason -- these are extraordinary times -- For all of us!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Some of our biggest clients are affected. They all complain they're practically working for the Government.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Most of them claim it'll be all they can do to stay in business till the next election. So they're cutting expenses right and left -- and we're the first to feel it. Naturally we have to do something about it.
JOHNNY=>Naturally.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What?
JOHNNY=>Naturally!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>I don't want to cut down the personnel of my staff if I can possibly help it. -- Wouldn't be constructive. So the only way out -- as I can see it -- is to tighten our belts. I'm asking everyone to take a twenty-five percent cut. I'm starting by taking a substantial cut in my own personal drawing account. It's a sacrifice, but it hits all of us. These are days of sacrifice!
JOHNNY=>I know, Judge, but I --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>These are times when we all have to put our shoulders to the wheel -- if we're to survive!
JOHNNY=>Yes, sir, our shoulders to the wheel -- Only I --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>I'm glad you understand, Mason -- I appreciate your cooperation.
JOHNNY=>Thank you, sir.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Hello -- Excuse me, Mason.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Hello, Commissioner. -- You know that little piece of property on Park Avenue? Well -- if the price is right --
LILY=>Did you want something, Mister Mason?
JOHNNY=>No thank you, Lily.
JOHNNY=>Well?
JANE=>Good morning, Johnny.
JOHNNY=>Good morning.
JANE=>How do you feel?
JOHNNY=>I feel fine!
JANE=>What time is it?
JOHNNY=>Three o'clock! Four o'clock! Five o'clock! High noon!
JANE=>It's just two, isn't it?
JOHNNY=>If you know the time why do you ask me? What difference does it make what time it is? I feel fine.
JANE=>Feel better now?
JOHNNY=>I feel fine!
JANE=>Are you comfortable?
JOHNNY=>Plenty comfortable.
JANE'S VOICE=>Are you sure you're comfortable?
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>Certainly I'm sure I'm comfortable!
JANE=>Don't you think you'd be more comfortable if you took off your shoes?
JANE=>Can I help you?
JOHNNY=>I don't need any help! I feel fine!
JOHNNY=>What time is it? Am I comfortable? How do I feel? You'd think I committed some sort of crime! You'd think I was on the witness stand! A man comes home looking for a little peace and quiet, and what happens? Blah-blah- blah! Why didn't I call you back? Why didn't I come home for supper? A million questions just because a man --
JANE=>I ran into Judge Doolittle this afternoon -- after you saw him.
JANE=>Oh, Johnny -- you fool! What does it matter if you get a raise or a partnership -- or anything!
JOHNNY=>Oh, Jane -- I let you down! I'll always let you down! I'm no good!
JANE=>Johnny, don't say that! It was my fault for interfering. I made you do it and I'm terribly sorry... I'll never do it again... never. We don't need anything -- we've got each other and the baby -- our beautiful baby -- You're all I have and all I want -- -- and please -- if you feel bad I'll die!
JANE=>Johnny, Johnny, look at me and tell me you don't feel bad!
JOHNNY=>Jane -- I don't feel bad.
JOHNNY=>Jane -- I don't feel bad. I feel fine -- honest I do.
JANE=>Johnny, the next time you go out and get tight... you'd better take me... along with you... or I'll... I'll get a divorce...
JOHNNY=>You'd better get a good lawyer.
JANE=>I've got a good lawyer.
LILY'S VOICE=>Keep coming -- Come on, keep coming -- Come on now.
LILY=>If you want something you gotta go get it.
LILY'S VOICE=>That's it -- come on now! Come on!
LILY=>Mis' Mason -- you should have seen him travel!
LILY=>Is you tired?
JANE=>I've been all over town. My head's splitting.
LILY=>Lean back, and let Lily rub the back of your neck.
LILY=>Been visitin' 'round, Mis' Mason?
JANE=>Uh-huh.
LILY=>Does Mr. Mason knows you's lookin' for a job?
JANE=>Who says I'm looking for a job?
JANE=>Lily, it isn't nice to go prying into other people's business.
LILY=>'Scuse me, Mis' Mason.
JANE=>Lily, you must be the fifteenth woman I've had working for me since I've been married, and you're too good to be true. You're worth your weight in gold.
LILY=>That's a lot of gold.
JANE=>You're the best woman I've ever had in the house -- just simply perfect -- and that's why it just breaks my heart to have to tell you --
LILY=>Never you mind, honey. I knows I'm a luxury.
JANE=>I'd never let you go -- never -- only I --
LILY=>Shucks, honey, you ain't gettin' rid of me -- you're just gittin' me off the budget. Is the head better?
JANE=>Much better... I'll make such a mess of things without you.
LILY=>No you won't -- you'll step right in and do the job. And it's a pretty good job, too -- a whole lot better'n you can get on the outside. Takin' care of a nice young man an' a sweet lil' baby an' a old lady that's jes' a little persnickety -- that's 'cause she's gittin' along an' don't have nothin' to do.
JANE=>I wish it were as simple as that.
LILY=>Lily's a lot older than you are, honey. She's done a lot o' livin' an' she's learned one thing: Never let the seeds stop you from enjoyin' de watermelon!
JANE=>That's all right if you've got watermelon.
LILY=>Don't say dat, Mis' Mason. You got your watermelon. But you're chokin' up on all dem li'l seeds. All I say is "Spit 'em out! Spit 'em out, before they spoils your taste for the melon!
JANE=>Spit 'em out...
JOHNNY=>Bless you.
JANE=>Bless you. Are you sure Carter has our telephone number?
JOHNNY=>If he hasn't he certainly has a telephone book.
JANE=>Then why do you suppose he hasn't at least called up?
MRS. MASON=>Perhaps he forgot all about it.
JOHNNY=>Mother, a man doesn't invite you to a New Year's Eve party and then just forget about it.
JANE=>Maybe we ought to go join him at the party.
JOHNNY=>Jane, I told you I don't know where the party is. He said he'd call for us here in his car at nine o'clock sharp.
JANE=>Well, it's almost eleven now.
MRS. MASON=>Isn't the party also to announce his engagement to Eunice Doolittle?
JOHNNY=>Something like that.
MRS. MASON=>Well, perhaps he thought it might be a little awkward to have you and Jane at his engagement party.
JOHNNY=>Now, Mother! How could it be awkward?
JANE=>Awkward or not awkward -- are we going to sit here all night waiting for him? Let's call him up!
MRS. MASON=>All the same it might be awkward.
JANE=>Why should it be awkward?
JOHNNY=>They say at Carter's house he left two hours ago. We'd better forget it.
JANE=>The baby definitely has the sniffles.
MRS. MASON=>All babies have sniffles this time of the year.
JOHNNY=>He caught his cold from you, Mother.
MRS. MASON=>That's simply ridiculous! Matter of fact, I caught my cold from the baby. He's had sniffles all day. When I took his temperature --
JOHNNY=>That's when he caught your cold.
MRS. MASON=>He certainly didn't! He had no temperature.
JANE=>It's all right, Johnny -- it's just the sniffles!
MRS. MASON=>I suppose I ought to stay in my room all day!
JANE=>Now, Mother, that's silly. You don't have to do anything of the kind!
MRS. MASON=>Heaven knows I try to earn my room and board by being as helpful as I can!
JANE=>Oh, Mother, please -- it's New Year's Eve!
MRS. MASON=>It's just like any other day as far as I'm concerned. You're both perfectly willing to leave me all alone to wait for the New Year, when perhaps it's the last New Year I'll ever see.
JOHNNY=>Mother -- why do you keep saying things like that?
JANE=>It's Carter!
LILY=>Evenin', Mister Mason!
JOHNNY=>Hello, Lily.
JANE=>Happy New Year, Lily.
LILY=>Happy New Year, Mis' Mason. I want to leave this with you.
JANE=>Lily, you sweet old thing!
LILY=>It's nothin' at all. I had the day off so I cooked up the chicken and the place where I work gimme de wine.
LILY=>Happy New Year to you all!
JOHNNY=>Happy New Year to you!
JANE=>Happy New Year, Lily. Have a good time.
LILY=>All right -- goodbye.
JOHNNY=>That solves everything -- now we won't have to go out! We'll stay right here and celebrate.
JANE=>We'll open up the wine now and at midnight we'll have a grand feast on Lily's chicken! Come on -- it's New Year's Eve -- let's have fun!
MRS. MASON=>You know I get indigestion if I eat just before I go to bed. Maybe there'll be some left over for me tomorrow. I never did approve of Lily -- she's much too forward -- but I do miss her cooking!
JANE=>That doesn't say much for mine.
MRS. MASON=>Oh, you'll learn, my dear. It takes time of course.
JANE=>I won't say anything.
MRS. MASON=>Times are different now. When I was married, every well brought up girl knew something about cooking.
MRS. MASON=>Why, Jane -- what is it?
JANE=>I can't cook!... I can't keep house!... I don't know how to bring up a baby!...
JOHNNY=>Now Jane, please --
MRS. MASON=>I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about!
JANE=>Oh yes you do! You've resented me from the first moment you saw me! You resented me because you wanted Johnny to marry Eunice Doolittle!
MRS. MASON=>My dear, I never said anything like that!
JANE=>You've hinted it often enough!
MRS. MASON=>I've done nothing of the sort! But they were engaged.
JOHNNY=>Mother, I never was engaged to Eunice Doolittle.
MRS. MASON=>Not what you'd call engaged, perhaps --
JOHNNY=>And even if I were, you shouldn't keep mentioning it to Jane all the time.
MRS. MASON=>I can't understand why she's so touchy about it.
JANE=>Touchy! That's why you hate me!
JOHNNY=>Jane -- will you please --
MRS. MASON=>No -- let her go on. She can say anything she likes -- I know my place here. I'm only a guest -- an unwelcome guest.
JOHNNY=>For crying out loud! What's the matter with you two?
JANE=>Nothing's the matter with me!
MRS. MASON=>It's her house!
JOHNNY=>Please, Mother --
JANE=>It's not my house!
JOHNNY=>Now, Jane -- please --
MRS. MASON=>I do the best I can to help!
JOHNNY=>Now, listen.
JANE=>I'm the stranger around here! Everything I say is wrong! Everything I do is wrong!
JOHNNY=>Jane -- will you --
MRS. MASON=>Just because I happened to mention that John and Eunice Doolittle --
JOHNNY=>Now stop it! BOTH of you!
JOHNNY=>There! You see what you made me say to Mother!
JANE=>You said it to me too! Don't I count?
JOHNNY=>Of course you count, darling -- only Mother's an old lady -- she won't be with us for very long. Why can't you get along with her?
JANE=>Why can't she get along with me? Because she hates me! You don't know how it is -- you're at the office all day. Between taking care of the baby and the house and cooking and listening to her criticize everything I do -- I can't stand it any more!
JANE=>You can only spit out so many seeds!
JANE=>Johnny! Johnny!
JANE=>JOHNNY!
JANE=>Johnny!
JOHNNY=>What?
JANE=>Where are you going?
JOHNNY=>Oh, I don't know. Anywhere to get away from that wrangling.
JANE=>Wait a minute! Don't you want me to go with you?
JOHNNY=>Well -- can't you understand a man wants to be alone once in a while?
JANE=>I'm sorry, Johnny -- really I am.
JOHNNY=>You don't have to apologize.
JANE=>Would you rather I didn't come with you?
JANE=>All right, Johnny. I don't mind. You go along and have a good time.
JOHNNY=>Oh -- Come on along if you want to.
JANE=>You're sure you don't mind?
JOHNNY=>Certainly I don't mind...
JANE=>We'll have a wonderful time -- you just wait and see...
JANE=>Oh, Johnny, what's happened to us?
JOHNNY=>I don't know. Maybe I pulled a dirty trick on you when I took that cinder out of your eye up in Boston.
JANE=>What do you mean?
JOHNNY=>I mean -- maybe the whole thing's been a mistake.
JANE=>What -- whole -- thing?
JOHNNY=>Our marriage.
JANE=>Oh, Johnny.
JOHNNY=>I've gotten into debt -- I've gotten nowhere at the office and I've made a household drudge out of you, just as Mother said. Jane, it hasn't worked out -- it just hasn't worked out!
JANE=>But we've never had any real trouble. Maybe a few silly little things -- things that everybody has to meet when they get married.
JOHNNY=>Maybe we shouldn't have had the baby --
JANE=>Oh, Johnny -- you can't be sorry about the baby?
JOHNNY=>I'm crazy about him!... And about you too! I'd die for either of you. Jane, everybody that passes this table stops and looks at you. It's because you're young and so beautiful -- your whole life ahead of you --
JANE=>Ahead of us --
JOHNNY=>No -- not when you're dragged down by a guy who just can't make the grade. No, I'm not going to hold you to that kind of a contract.
JANE=>Well -- you ought to know all about contracts. Well, anyway, I suppose this is what you'd call starting the New Year right!
JANE=>At least we've finally got something we can celebrate. Well -- Happy New Year --
JOHNNY=>Happy New Year.
JANE=>Want to dance, darling?
JANE=>I think I'll go phone the house and wish the baby a Happy New Year.
JOHNNY=>Jane -- I'll --
WOMAN=>Crying Jag!
DRUNK=>Happy New Year, Blondie!
MAN=>Hey Sister -- Wait a minute ---
ANOTHER MAN=>Hurry back, Honey!
BLONDE=>Hey, Lonely Heart -- what's the matter?
JOHNNY=>Happy New Year!
BLONDE=>All alone? C'mon over and join our party.
JOHNNY=>Happy New Year!
BLONDE=>Why're you so mad -- don't you feel good?
JOHNNY=>I feel fine.
BLONDE=>C'mon, han'some, we got champagne! Look what I found! A poor little lamb lost in the storm -- alone and neglected.
JANE=>Johnny! Come quick! The baby!
JANE=>Something's the matter with the baby!
JANE=>Mother! The baby! Was that --?
JOHNNY=>Doctor Healy, what is it?
DOCTOR HEALY=>Pneumonia!
JANE=>Oh...
JOHNNY=>Doctor Healy --
DOCTOR HEALY=>Come into the office a minute.
DOCTOR HEALY=>Sit down, my boy.
DOCTOR HEALY=>You'd better get your wife.
JOHNNY=>Now, Doctor, if it's bad news I don't want her to know about it. She just couldn't stand it -- but you can tell me, Doctor.
DOCTOR HEALY=>Your baby has type nine Pneumoccocus with a streptoccocus complication. And I'm sorry to say that the congestion is increasing. Now, there's a serum -- a new one -- it's worked out in some cases. Without it, we don't stand a chance. With it, well, perhaps we have a ghost of a chance. We must get some of that serum as soon as possible. Every hour counts. I don't know whether we can locate any of it in the city or not. I'm going to check up on that right away.
JOHNNY=>Doctor -- please don't tell my wife --
DOCTOR HEALY=>I won't. Give me the City Health Department.
PHARMACIST=>All the type 9 serum has been sent to Salt Lake. Why don't you try Johns Hopkins in Baltimore?
WOMAN=>Sorry -- we shipped all we had for the epidemic in Salt Lake City.
MAN=>Yes, the epidemic is under control here in Salt Lake, and we can spare six 20 c.c. vials, but how are you going to get it out of here in this storm?
JOHNNY=>I've got to see Judge Doolittle right away!
SIMON=>At this hour of the morning?
JOHNNY=>You'll have to wake him up!
SIMON=>Oh -- I couldn't do that.
JOHNNY=>You've got to! He knows me -- I work for him. I've got to see him!
SIMON=>I'm sorry, but Judge Doolittle would never allow me to --
SIMON=>Say, there!... Wait! Wait!... You mustn't do that!... Where're you going?
SIMON'S VOICE=>You mustn't do this!... This is outrageous!
JOHNNY=>Judge Doolittle --
JOHNNY=>Judge Doolittle!
JOHNNY=>Come on -- wake up! WAKE UP!
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>Judge, I'm sorry to wake you like this --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What... what is this?
JOHNNY=>I've got to talk to you right now --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Are you drunk?
JOHNNY=>My kid's in the hospital -- he's got pneumonia --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>You must be drunk waking me up in the middle of the night like this -- it's outrageous! Never heard of such a thing!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Mason, if this is your way of celebrating the New Year --
JOHNNY=>Put it on!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Now Mason, you listen to me --
JOHNNY=>No! -- You listen to me! When you asked me to take a cut I took it -- but I shouldn't have. Because that's the reason the baby has to sleep in the dining room and --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What're you talking about?
JOHNNY=>My baby's in the hospital, dying of pneumonia!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What?
JOHNNY=>Dying!... Dying!... Can't you understand that?
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Dying?
JOHNNY=>Yes, my baby!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Your baby? Well, Why didn't you get in touch with me sooner? I'm terribly sorry.
JOHNNY=>I don't need sympathy -- I need serum! There isn't any in New York -- and there's none anywhere near here -- and they finally located some in Salt Lake City -- and that's two thousand miles away and every hour counts!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Now, Mason -- be calm --
JOHNNY=>I can't be calm -- I'll never be calm till I get the serum. And the only way to get it here is to fly it --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Certainly!... Fly it!... Of course!
JOHNNY=>But there's a terrific storm over Utah -- all planes are grounded -- if there's just one thing we could do --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Now, Mason -- get hold of yourself!... I know how you feel, but get hold of yourself! Suppose the planes are grounded -- Why can't you put it on one of the fast trains?
JOHNNY=>But we can't. I told you hours count -- every minute counts. It'd be too late. We need a plane from Salt Lake and we've got one but the pilot wants five thousand dollars to fly it to New York -- And Judge, I didn't have anyone else to turn to --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>SIMON! Well, what're you standing there for?
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>My check book!... Get me my check book!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>And get me a pen! Quick! One that will write! And find out where the nearest telegraph office is!
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>You should have gotten in touch with me sooner -- but don't you worry about that serum; we'll have it here and in plenty of time too!
HATTON=>Yeah, Mr. Mason -- the serum's here and the money's here too -- and I could certainly use the dough. But the weather's gotten so bad it's impossible to take off -- What can I do? --
HATTON=>I know how you feel -- I'm married myself and I've got a couple of kids -- but I got to think of them too. My wife won't let me -- she says if I go she won't be here when I get back -- if I get back. What do you do with a guy like that?
CONWAY=>Let me talk to him. Now listen you -- what do you think this is -- a suicide club? You can't expect anybody in his right mind to fly a plane on a night like this -- especially an old crate with whiskers. Why don't you -- Sure... That's tough... we'd certainly like to help you -- ain't there no other place you could get some of the stuff? Maybe in a few hours, when the weather clears up -- Gee, the guy's crying -- Now wait a minute, buddy... take it easy... Suppose we -- maybe I -- hold the wire! He just won't take No for an answer. Jim, could I borrow your plane?
HATTON=>Are you nuts?
CONWAY=>You know how it is -- you've got kids of your own. Suppose you was in his place --
HATTON=>I can't let you have my plane. I've got no insurance on it -- I couldn't get any --
CONWAY=>Hold it a minute -- keep your shirt on -- I'll give you half the money if you'll loan me the crate.
HATTON=>Suppose you crack it up --
CONWAY=>Then you can keep the whole five -- I won't need it.
HATTON=>I think you're crazy. But, all right -- if you want to.
CONWAY=>Okay, buddy -- relax.
COLLINS=>Do you think he'll ever get off the ground with all that gas?
HATTON=>Well, I did -- going to Honolulu --
HATTON=>I can't say I like that kind of money -- but it looks like I'll be in five grand before morning.
DR. HEALY=>He's all right -- he's holding his own nicely.
JANE=>May I go in and see him?
DR. HEALY=>I don't think you'd better -- not just now.
JANE=>Why, doctor? Why don't you want me to see him?
DR. HEALY=>Now, don't worry -- it's just that --
JANE=>Then why don't you want me to see him?
JANE=>You're lying to me, Doctor! The baby's worse; that's why you ordered the oxygen.
MRS. MASON=>Jane, dear -- Jane -- please...
DR. HEALY=>The oxygen's only to help him till the serum gets here.
JANE=>You're lying to me!
DR. HEALY=>I want you to lie down and rest -- I'll give you something to make you sleep. Will you do that for me?
JANE=>Oh, Doctor Healy -- I couldn't! Please don't make me!
JANE=>I'm sorry, Doctor -- I'm all right now. When can I see him?
DR. HEALY=>In a little while.
JANE=>If my baby dies, I want to die, too.
MRS. MASON=>I know, dear, I know... But you mustn't feel that way. You mustn't let John know you feel that way... He loves the baby too... Almost as much as he loves you.
JANE=>Poor Johnny... He'll be so lonely if the baby --
MRS. MASON=>He'll have you, Jane... And you'll have him... And you can't be lonely... either of you... as long as you have each other... Do you know when you're really lonely? It's when you have no one to share things with... not even a loss...
JANE=>Oh, Mother -- you're lonely... aren't you?
MRS. MASON=>I wasn't -- always -- a bitter old woman... I wasn't always a pest and a nuisance... ...not when I had someone to share things with.
MRS. MASON=>And now the baby... Oh, my baby's baby...
JANE=>Oh, Mother, Mother...
OPERATOR=>Denver calling Commercial NC 24. Come in, Conway.
DENVER OPERATOR'S VOICE=>Still can't contact Conway. Storm increasing over the Rockies. Denver.
NEWARK SUPERINTENDENT=>Send out an emergency to all stations. Stand by to contact Conway.
NORTH PLATTE OPERATOR=>North Platte, Nebraska calling Conway -- Commercial NC 24. Do you read me?
OMAHA OPERATOR=>Conway NC 24. This is Omaha. Do you read me, Conway?
CHICAGO OPERATOR=>Chicago calling Commercial NC 24... Conway can you read me? Can't you answer, Conway?
RANGER=>No, we haven't seen or heard a plane all day. Sorry, but there's no use sending searching parties out in this blizzard.
JANE=>Oh, if there was just something I could do... If there was just something...
SISTER MADELAINE=>There is... Come with me.
JANE=>Sister Madelaine, I'm not a Catholic --
SISTER MADELAINE=>That doesn't matter.
JANE=>You know how much he means to Johnny and me... we've only had him such a little while... Oh God, dear, dear God, please... We do want to see him grow up and be a man. Please help our little baby... we love him so... he's so small and helpless... he can't do anything for himself... and we can't seem to do anything... for him... Please -- Please -- Please...
NURSE=>Shall I order another tank of oxygen, Doctor?
DR. HEALY=>If the serum isn't here in a couple of hours...
JANE=>Hello, Johnny.
JOHNNY=>Hello, Jane.
JOHNNY=>We'll always be together, Jane -- no matter what happens -- like this, always.
FARMER=>Who are you? What do you want?
CONWAY=>I'm hurt. Will you help me?
FARMER'S WIFE=>Mercy sakes alive.
FARMER=>What is it -- what's happened?
CONWAY=>Never mind that -- what place is this?
FARMER=>Liberty Corners.
CONWAY=>Where's that?
FARMER=>Thirty-five miles from New York.
FARMER'S WIFE=>Well, for mercy sakes alive.
FARMER=>St. Francis Hospital, New York City. Rush.
FARMER=>Hello -- hello -- operator, I want the St. Francis Hospital, New York City. And reverse the charges.
JOHNNY=>Happy New Year, darling.
JANE=>Happy New Year -- Happy New Year --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Well, gentlemen, I guess four's about enough on a business day.
CONWAY=>That's all very well, Joe -- but isn't it about time you bought one?
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>What's that?
CONWAY=>Conway calling Doolittle...
JOHNNY'S VOICE=>And there are certain things, gentlemen, that I want distinctly understood.
JOHNNY=>Now, I called this meeting of all the partners in order to make my position clear once and for all. That before I accept your offer of partnership in the firm of --
JOHNNY=>-- Doolittle -- Messerschmidt -- Doolittle -- Hutch -- and Carter, you must know that I consider the methods of this firm at the present time old-fashioned, self-satisfied, high-handed and thoroughly inefficient.
CARTER=>It seems to me --
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Quiet!
JOHNNY=>And I demand that they be changed -- effective immediately.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Come in!
JANE=>Excuse me, I hope we haven't interrupted anything important --
JOHNNY=>Now, Jane --
JANE=>Johnny, I know Judge Doolittle won't mind --
JANE=>We just couldn't wait --
MRS. MASON=>We had to rush down the minute it happened!
JOHNNY=>What happened?
JANE=>The baby can TALK!
JANE=>They don't believe us! Come on, darling -- we'll prove it to them!
JANE'S VOICE=>Show them, darling! Don't be afraid -- speak up -- say Daddy! Say Daddy -- please, darling -- say Daddy!
JOHNNY=>Say Daddy! D--D--D -- Daddy.
JUDGE DOOLITTLE=>Say Daddy -- say Daddy --
JANE=>Come on, Johnny. Say Daddy -- Say Daddy --
BABY=>Ma-ma.
DOOLITTLE BROTHERS=>What?
