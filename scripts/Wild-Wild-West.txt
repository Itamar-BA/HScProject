GORDON/DORA=>'And tell them I tried... And tell them I cried...'
GORDON/DORA=>Oh really. One can hardly notice...
GORDON=>
LOVELESS=>... the welcome wagon.
PRESIDENT GRANT=>I hear you let General McGrath get away?
PRESIDENT GRANT=>Of course I know him, he's the best marshal I've got! He's a genius.
PRESIDENT GRANT=>... And you, West -- not every situation calls for your patented approach of shoot first, shoot later, shoot again -- then when they're all dead, try to ask a question or two.

GORDON=>Morton's last image!
WEST=>Now touch yourself.
GORDON=>
GORDON=>I am so embarrassed.
MUNITIA=>Nitro this time, sire.
LOVELESS=>Other than a lack of wheelchair access, I find it a most comfortable way to pass the long miles from here to my laboratory in Spider Canyon...
MISS LIPPENREIDER=>West. How do you know it's not just bullshit? Gordon. Step over the fence and find out. Rita and I will put flowers on your grave every year.
GORDON=>Head for that gully!
WEST=>You won't have to!
WEST=>I did not do shit!
GORDON=>Apologies, apologies.
WEST=>Gordon, let's ride!
GORDON=>You know him, sir...
LOVELESS=>
PRESIDENT GRANT=>Never will I sign that paper, never will the United States ever surrender!
WEST=>Avant...! Avant!!!
GORDON=>
PRESIDENT GRANT=>Keep that surrender handy. I think you're going to need it!
GORDON=>Ravishing, a vision.
RITA=>I didn't think so.
