WOMAN'S VOICE=>Murderer.
FEMALE FACE=>Howard --
MALE FACE=>I forgot my glasses.
MALE FACE=>You know how blind I am without them.
THE THREE OF THEM=>Murderer.
ANDERTON=>Okay, Jad, what's coming?
JAD=>Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female. Killer's male, white, 40's.
JAD=>We need confirmation on the time frame. Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
ANDERTON=>Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks. My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
ANDERTON=>Have the witnesses previewed and validated #1108?
POLLARD=>Affirmative. Validated.
JAMES=>Go get him.
ANDERTON=>Stand by...
ANDERTON=>Alright, Howard, where are you...
A WOMEN'S VOICE=>Breakfast!
VOICE=>For score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this, um...
SARAH=>Continent...
SON=>Continent. A new nation, conceived in liberty...
SARAH=>Howard?! Breakfast!
JAD=>I show eight "Howard Marks" inside the District. Sorting by race and age.
ANDERTON=>Let's see if we can get lucky...
ANDERTON=>Come on...
VOICE=>Morning, Mr. Marks.
JAD=>We can't grab it...
ANDERTON=>Run the subscription list...
ANDERTON=>I've got north facing shadows out the window of the building behind. I need trig and image analysis...
JAD=>Workin' it.
ANDERTON=>Morning, detectives.
SARAH=>Breakfast, honey.
HOWARD=>He looks familiar.
SARAH=>Who?
HOWARD=>The man across the street. I've seen him before...
SARAH=>How can you even tell? You know how blind you are without your glasses.
JAD=>Got him in the Foxhall. 4421 Gainsborough.
ANDERTON=>Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route. What's our confirmed time?
JAD=>From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
FLETCHER=>Seventeen minutes.
ANDERTON=>Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
KNOTT=>Hey, Steadman, wanna lose those ten ugly pounds like right now?
PETROTTA=>Touch me with that puke-pole, asshole, you're gonna wear the fuckin' risoto I had for dinner last night along with the two chilidogs I had for breakfast.
JAD=>Chief, we got a problem with our location --
JAD=>It's no longer there.
ANDERTON=>Where we going, Agatha? Talk to me.
FLETCHER=>Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
ANDERTON=>You're kidding, that's today?
FLETCHER=>I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
ANDERTON=>All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now. Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded. See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
FLETCHER=>Uh, sir...
ANDERTON=>Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
VOICE=>I've got coffee, thank you.
WITWER=>Danny Witwer. The "Twink from the Fed". Gum?
JAD=>The Marks moved two weeks ago. No one knows where. Still searching for family and employer.
MECHANICAL VOICE=>Time horizon: 12 minutes...
ANDERTON=>I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
WITWER=>Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
ANDERTON=>Original running bond brick pattern, streamlined early Georgian Details...
FLETCHER=>What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
ANDERTON=>The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars. I show composite mouldings with dentils. Someone took care in the renovation. Let's find the architect...
FLETCHER=>Victims are pronounced here. Killers here. We never touch anything.
ANDERTON=>I show a cop on horseback.
JAD=>Somewhere near the capital?
ANDERTON=>No maglev system.
JAD=>The mall?
ANDERTON=>Georgetown.
FLETCHER=>This is Evanna, the team pilot.
WITWER=>Nice to meet you. Gum?
EVANNA=>Oh, thank you...
WITWER=>She's cute.
FLETCHER=>Filtered, the Precogs can see outward up to four days with a sensory range of 200 miles.
WITWER=>So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
FLETCHER=>Not after the vote next week. Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
JAD=>Two Howard Markses EYEdented in the sprawl. Neither show married --
ANDERTON=>I show a match for Dwight Kingsley. Nineteenth century architect. He did two dozen houses in D.C....
MECHANICAL VOICE=>Time Horizon, ten minutes...
WITWER=>Can't they shut that off?
FLETCHER=>That's the Red Ball Alarm.
FLETCHER=>Crime of passion. No premeditation. They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one. We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
WITWER=>People have gotten the message. Gum?
SON=>... the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here...
HOWARD=>I was thinking, maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today.
SARAH=>What about your meeting?
HOWARD=>I'll reschedule. I've been working too much anyway.
SON=>... that these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave us they gave the last full measure of devotion...
HOWARD=>We could have lunch together.
SARAH=>I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
HOWARD=>Ah. That must be why you look so nice.
SARAH=>Raincheck?
HOWARD=>Sure. Raincheck.
SON=>... that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain...
SARAH=>Your ride's here. Get your stuff.
JAD=>Director. Line three.
BURGESS=>Tell me not to worry, John.
ANDERTON=>Don't worry, Lamar.
BURGESS=>The nation votes this week...
BURGESS=>Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
ANDERTON=>Uh-huh...
BURGESS=>Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
ANDERTON=>Hang on, Lamar --
ANDERTON=>Look at the kid. In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
JAD=>Yeah? So?
ANDERTON=>Now look at him...
ANDERTON=>It's a park.
SARAH=>Come on...
FLETCHER=>There's only sixteen of those old merry-go-rounds left in the city. Two of which are in Georgetown. One in Barnaby woods, the other Woodley.
ANDERTON=>Woodley's all Victorian. It's gotta be Barnaby Woods. I want two cameras: one Spyder, one floater.
WITWER=>As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
ANDERTON=>They did. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be back in an hour.
WITWER=>You mind if I tag along?
ANDERTON=>I'd love to take you along, Inspector, but there's no room on the ship.
EVANNA=>Time Horizon six minutes.
MECHANICAL VOICE=>Time Horizon. One minute.
EVANNA=>Chief, we're catching up to the future.
ANDERTON=>Jad?
JAD=>Go ahead.
ANDERTON=>Did he close the front door?
JAD=>What?
ANDERTON=>Did Marks close the front door?!
JAD=>Negative -- front door is open! The front door is open!!
MECHANICAL VOICE=>Time Horizon, thirty seconds --
EVANNA=>Hold on!
SARAH=>Howard --
HOWARD=>I forgot my glasses.
HOWARD=>You know how blind I am without them.
HOWARD=>What --
ANDERTON=>Mr. Marks, you're under arrest for --
ANDERTON=>Knott --
ANDERTON=>Positive for Howard Marks --
ANDERTON=>By mandate of the District of Columbia Precrime division, I'm placing you under arrest for the future murder of Sarah Marks and Donald Doobin that was to take place today, April 22, at oh-eight hundred hours, four minutes --
SARAH=>What?
HOWARD=>I didn't do anything! Sarah!
ANDERTON=>Give the man his hat.
HOWARD=>Oh, God. Don't put the halo on me!
HOWARD=>I wasn't going to do it! I wasn't going to hurt her! I just wanted to scare her!
WITWER=>I thought they stopped the murder --
JAD=>That's just an echo. Precog Deja Vu. Some of the really bad ones, the Precogs see over and over again.
VOICE OVER=>Precrime: It works!
VOICES PRECRIME: IT WORKS!=>IT WORKS IT WORKS IT WORKS...
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN=>I used to worry about my children going to the playground...
POLICEMAN=>My partner was murdered...
VARIOUS PEOPLE=>My sister was murdered... My brother was killed... I was attacked in the stairwell... My teacher was stabbed... My neighbor was shot... My child was murdered...
A DEEP VOICE=>In a world where we look to science for answers, they were a gift...
VARIOUS PEOPLE=>I was going to be killed in my apartment... He was going to rape me and then stab me... It was going to happen in a parking lot... We were having marital problems, I had no idea he would try and...
THE DEEP VOICE=>And now, Precrime is coming to your state, allowing you to sleep as well as we do in the District of Columbia.
THE DEEP VOICE=>On April 30, vote Yes on the National Precrime Referendum and make murder a thing of the past.
CHILDREN=>Precrime: It works!
ANDERTON=>Lycon?
A VOICE=>What's the matter, can't sleep?
ANDERTON=>I just need a little clarity.
LYCON=>True that. You want the customary, or the new and improved?
ANDERTON=>I'll try the new stuff.
LYCON=>Sweet dreams, Chief.
LYCON=>Oh, don't worry none, your secret's safe with me. After all, you gonna be The Big Boss soon enough, be nice to have a little juice on my side.
ANDERTON=>What makes you say I'm gonna be the boss?
LYCON=>You're the perfect man for the job. It's like my Daddy used to say, "In the land of the blind..."
LYCON=>"The one eyed-man is King".
SEAN=>Daddy!
SEAN=>Catch!
SEAN=>Hi, Daddy...
ANDERTON=>Hi, Sean. How was your day?
SEAN=>I scored a goal!
ANDERTON=>That's great.
SEAN=>I raced mommy!
SEAN=>I won!
ANDERTON=>What a big boy. How old are you?
SEAN=>I want pizza!
ANDERTON=>How old are you, Sean?
ANDERTON=>Four. Wow. What a big boy. I love you, Sean.
SEAN=>I love you, too! I love you daddy. Love ya, dad.
VINCENT NASH=>On the eve of a national referendum that will make all of our citizens safe from violent crime...
NASH=>... it's the responsibility of the Justice Department to fully review and inspect the Precrime system.
ANDERTON=>Shit --
SYNTH VOICE=>You have twelve messages.
BURGESS' VOICE=>John? Where the hell are you?
BURGESS=>Speaking on behalf of Precrime, I'd just like to say that we welcome any review by Attorney General Nash and his team, although I must say I'm somewhat baffled by their timing.
BURGESS=>In the six years we've been conducting our little experiment there hasn't been a single murder in the District.
BURGESS=>So I'm sure I speak for Chief Anderton who's on assignment, that we plan to do everything we can to help our good friends and colleagues at the Justice Department...
BURGESS=>Those bastards at Justice want to take it all away from us.
BURGESS=>And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
ANDERTON=>Lamar, I'm sorry. I don't know what --
BURGESS=>Don't apologize, John.
BURGESS=>You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
ANDERTON=>I understand. Sir.
BURGESS=>I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
ANDERTON=>Yes, sir.
BURGESS=>You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him. If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
ANDERTON=>I understand. What's the other thing?
BURGESS=>Tuck in your shirt.
FLETCHER=>The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood. And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
WITWER=>I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
KNOTT=>Here we go again...
WITWER=>Look, I'm not with the ACLU on this Jeff. But let's not kid ourselves, we are arresting individuals who've broken no law.
JAD=>But they will.
FLETCHER=>The commission of the crime itself is absolute metaphysics. The Precogs see the future. And they're never wrong.
WITWER=>But it's not the future if you stop it. Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
ANDERTON=>Yes, it is.
ANDERTON=>You're talking about predetermination, which happens all the time.
ANDERTON=>Why did you catch that?
WITWER=>Because it was going to fall.
ANDERTON=>You're certain?
WITWER=>Yes.
ANDERTON=>But it didn't fall. You caught it.
ANDERTON=>The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
WITWER=>You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it. How do the precogs tell the difference?
ANDERTON=>The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
WITWER=>Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
FLETCHER=>Because of the nature of murder. "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
WITWER=>Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
ANDERTON=>It was Iris Hineman. She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
WITWER=>Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
ANDERTON=>To Hineman?
WITWER=>To them.
ANDERTON=>Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
WITWER=>Really? You've never been inside?
ANDERTON=>We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
WITWER=>So I'll be the first one to go in then?
ANDERTON=>Maybe you didn't hear me.
WITWER=>If it's a question of authority.
ANDERTON=>There's no question. You don't have any.
WITWER=>I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
ANDERTON=>Show it to me.
WITWER=>Contrary to what you might think, this experiment is being conducted under the supervision and with the express permission of the Attorney General of the United States. I'm here as his representative. Which means... you're now operating under my supervision.
WITWER=>It seems you've been left out of the loop, John.
WALLY=>No no no no no...
WALLY=>I can't touch you! And John, you can't be in here! You'll confuse them!
ANDERTON=>Wally. This is Danny Witwer. He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
WITWER=>Nice to meet you, Wally.
WALLY=>Shhh! They're sleeping.
WITWER=>Tell me how all this works.
WITWER=>The photon milk acts as both a nutrient supply and a liquid conductor. It makes the images that each of them receive strong.
WALLY=>We call the female Agatha. The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.
WALLY=>We scan by way of optical tomography, white light pinpoints pulse along the entire length of the headgear and are re-read after absorption through their brain tissue.
WALLY=>In other words, we see what they see.
WALLY=>They're not in any pain. We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
ANDERTON=>It helps if you don't think of them as human.
WITWER=>No... they're much more than that.
WITWER=>Science has stolen most of our miracles. In a way... ... they give us hope... hope of the existence of the divine.
WITWER=>I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
ANDERTON=>The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
WITWER=>But you call this room the "temple".
ANDERTON=>Just a nickname.
WITWER=>The oracle isn't where the power is anyway. The power's always been with the priests. Even if they had to invent the oracle.
ANDERTON=>You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
JAD=>Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
ANDERTON=>Uh-huh. Jad?
JAD=>Sir?
ANDERTON=>Go back to work. All of you.
WITWER=>Sorry. Old habit. I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop. My father was a minister. Lutheran.
ANDERTON=>What does he think of your chosen line of work?
WITWER=>I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
WITWER=>I know what it's like to lose someone close, John. Of course, nothing is like the loss of a child.
WITWER=>I don't have any children of my own, so I can only imagine what that must have been like, to lose your son in a public place like that.
WITWER=>At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
ANDERTON=>Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
WITWER=>Flaws.
ANDERTON=>There hasn't been a murder in six years. There's nothing wrong with the system. It's perfect.
WITWER=>I agree. The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human. It always is. Thank you for the tour, Wally.
ANDERTON=>Uh, Wally --
ANDERTON=>Wally!
AGATHA=>Can you see?
WALLY=>John?!
WALLY=>What the hell just happened? Her ACTH levels just shot through the roof!
WALLY=>Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
ANDERTON=>Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
WALLY=>She grabbed you? Impossible. The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
ANDERTON=>She was looking right at me.
WALLY=>It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
ANDERTON=>She spoke to me.
WALLY=>To you? I don't think so... What'd she say?
ANDERTON=>She said...
ANDERTON=>"Can you see?"
ANDERTON=>Anderton. John.
MAN HOO BOY!=>You scared me, Chief.
ANDERTON=>You the sentry?
GIDEON=>Yes, sir. I'm Gideon. The music relaxes the prisoners.
GIDEON=>I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
ANDERTON=>No, you're not in trouble. I'm interested in a murder.
GIDEON=>Kill type?
ANDERTON=>Drowning.
GIDEON=>Well, that narrows it down. Not many in here for that one.
ANDERTON=>Victim's a white female.
GIDEON=>This about the Justice Department? They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m. Told me to wear a tie. You like this one?
ANDERTON=>Stop! Roll back... There!
GIDEON=>That's an old one. One of our first.
ANDERTON=>This is the official composite of the three precogs?
GIDEON=>That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
ANDERTON=>Show me just Agatha's data stream.
GIDEON=>For that, we have to go for a ride.
ANDERTON=>You the only sentry?
GIDEON=>I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
GIDEON=>Hey, bet you don't know where the term "graveyard shift" comes from?
GIDEON=>Long time ago, in merry old England, they discovered that some coffins, after they reopened 'em -- now why they did that, I couldn't tell you --
GIDEON=>Anyway, they discovered that some of the coffins had scratch marks on the inside, indicating that the person had not been dead when they buried them.
GIDEON=>So they tied a string to the wrist of each person that lead to a bell above ground.
GIDEON=>Someone was assigned to sit at night and listen for the bells.
GIDEON=>Hence the expression...
ANDERTON=>... Graveyard shift.
GIDEON=>Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
ANDERTON=>I'd forgotten there were so many.
GIDEON=>And to think they'd all be out there killing people if it wasn't for you.
SEAN=>Hey, Daddy!
SEAN=>Catch!
WITWER=>My God...
GIDEON=>They get to spend twenty years asleep, somewhere between life and death, all the while getting their bodies pumped up with nutrients they'd never get if they were out on the street. Okee pokee, here we go...
GIDEON=>John Doe drug addict was gonna put down a woman named Anne Lively at Roland Lake.
ANDERTON=>That's her --
ANDERTON=>Why's he still a John Doe? Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
GIDEON=>On account of those are not his eyes. He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
GIDEON=>You get it done on the street for a few hundred bucks these days.
GIDEON=>Okay, so you want just the female's prevision.
GIDEON=>Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
ANDERTON=>Try again.
GIDEON=>No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but... ... I can't pull up any data from the female. Probably just a glitch.
GIDEON=>Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
ANDERTON=>Just tell me about the intended victim. This Anne Lively...
GIDEON=>Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
ANDERTON=>So she cleaned up. Where is she now?
GIDEON=>Huh. How ironic...
GIDEON=>You finally crawl your way out of one hole, only to fall into another.
GIDEON=>Careful, Chief...
GIDEON=>You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.
BURGESS=>And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
ANDERTON=>I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there. And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
BURGESS=>You'd think we'd have found a cure for the common cold by now.
WIFE=>It's stress.
BURGESS=>What's this?
WIFE=>Herbal tea with honey.
BURGESS=>Yeah, well I hate herbal tea... almost as much as I hate honey.
WIFE=>Just drink it before I pour it in your lap.
ANDERTON=>Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
BURGESS=>So give him a tour. He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
ANDERTON=>If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
BURGESS=>He's not. He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
BURGESS=>Lara called me.
ANDERTON=>What?
BURGESS=>She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.
ANDERTON=>I'm fine.
BURGESS=>I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
ANDERTON=>I go running down there.
BURGESS=>In the middle of the night?
BURGESS=>What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
ANDERTON=>I'm fine, Lamar.
BURGESS=>You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
ANDERTON=>We won't let them.
BURGESS=>No? How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
BURGESS=>My father once said to me that you don't choose the things you believe in, they choose you. There's a reason you're here, John. Had Precrime been in place just six months earlier, the loss you and Lara suffered would have been prevented.
BURGESS=>Remember the eyes, John --
BURGESS=>Remember, the eyes of the nation are on us right now. We both know I'm not the generation anyone listens to. People trust you, John. When you speak of your absolute belief in Precrime, they know it's a belief born of pain and not politics. I've always understood that. And in some ways, I may have even encouraged it, to help with the cause. But now... your pain is hurting both of us.
ANDERTON=>They're not going to take it away from us, Lamar. I won't let them.
MODERATOR=>A week from today conventions will meet in every state to vote on the ratification of the precrime amendment. With us to discuss this historic decision are Chief John Anderton of Precrime in Washington D.C. and Ms. Dinola Margis, Director of the American Freedom Foundation. Both of you, thanks for being here.
ANDERTON/MARGIS=>Geraldine. Thanks for having me.
MODERATOR=>Ms. Margis, let me start with you. Last year, more people in this country lost their lives to murder than to natural causes. Doesn't such unparalleled violence require that we protect our citizens, whatever it takes?
MARGIS=>No, Geraldine, not at the price of giving up our most fundamental rights. For almost three centuries now, every accused citizen has had the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty. But, here, we have the beginnings of a system that punishes people for crimes that haven't even been committed. I feel stuck in a nightmare.
ANDERTON=>You forget, Dinola, that the Supreme Court has ruled that the Precogs predictions as foregone, metaphysical conclusions. Meaning what the Precogs say is going to happen, happens. Unless we stop it.
MARGIS=>You know, the Eutruscans used to read sheep livers to predict the future. Maybe we should try that one next.
ANDERTON=>That's funny. But the truth is, our Constitution has always recognized that in times of great danger we may have to take actions that... offend certain principles in order to preserve the nation itself.
ANDERTON=>In the middle of the civil war, for example, Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus observing that a limb may be sacrificed to save a life, but a life is never wisely given to save a limb.
MARGIS=>Let me ask you something, Chief? You're a former police officer -- when was the last time you Mirandized someone?
MARGIS=>You have the right to remain silent? You have the right to an attorney?
MARGIS=>When's the last time you actually said those words?
ANDERTON'S VOICE=>What are you looking at?
LARA=>Just the rain.
LARA=>Why don't you put that camera down and watch it with me?
ANDERTON=>Jad. How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
JAD=>We're in motion on something.
JAD=>From what I can see, we got a white male, about five-eight, approximately one-forty, takes a round in the ten ring, and goes out a window.
ANDERTON=>Red Ball?
JAD=>Nope. Somebody's thinking about this one.
ANDERTON=>Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
JAD=>I love this part.
FEMALE PRECOG=>Wait! Don't --
ANDERTON=>Here we go...
ANDERTON=>Shunt all cycles to a full vis correlation at my mark by the windows.
JAD=>The victim's name is Leo Crow.
ANDERTON=>Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow. And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
JAD=>I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
ANDERTON=>Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record. Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
ANDERTON=>Case #1109, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holosphere by Precrime's q-stacks. My fellow witnesses for case #1109 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
ANDERTON=>Are the witnesses ready to preview and validate #1109?
POLLARD=>Ready when you are, John.
JAMES=>Standing by.
ANDERTON=>I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
JAD=>That was easy.
ANDERTON=>Confirm with trig and image.
JAD=>Any ID on the shooter yet?
ANDERTON=>Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
ANDERTON=>Jesus...
ANDERTON=>Okay, very funny.
JAD=>You say something, Chief?
ANDERTON=>Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there? I'm starving.
JAD=>Sure, Chief. I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
ANDERTON=>Take your time.
WALLY=>Jad, are you getting this?
WALLY=>Jad?
POLLARD=>You saw that? You saw that, didn't you?
JAMES=>I saw it.
WALLY=>Chief?
WALLY=>I like you, Chief.
WALLY=>You've always been nice to me. I'll give you two minutes before I hit the siren.
JAD=>Here you go, Chief...
JAD=>Good Christ...
VOICE=>Say cheese!
VOICE=>Hold that, please!
WITWER=>Thanks.
WITWER=>You're in a lot of trouble, John.
ANDERTON=>You set me up...
WITWER=>I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
WITWER=>It seems I've found a flaw, John You.
ANDERTON=>You gonna tell on me?
WITWER=>Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
WITWER=>I guess we won't be working together after all.
WITWER=>Now put the gun down, John. I don't hear a Red Ball.
ANDERTON=>Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator. I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
BURGESS=>Justice already knows. Talk to me, John. Tell me what's happening?
ANDERTON=>This is all Witwer. He's setting me up.
BURGESS=>Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
ANDERTON=>Somebody named Leo Crow.
BURGESS=>And who the hell is that?
ANDERTON=>I have no idea. I've never heard of him. But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
BURGESS=>All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
ANDERTON=>I'm out of breath! I'm a fucking fugitive!
BURGESS=>Then come to my house. We'll talk --
ANDERTON=>I can't. They're following me right now. They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
BURGESS=>How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
ANDERTON=>Can you fake the cerebral output?
BURGESS=>We're years from that. John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
ANDERTON=>You know I can't do that. You can't do that... Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again. Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
BURGESS=>John. Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
COMPUTER VOICE=>Security lockdown enabled.
ANDERTON=>Jesus, you don't believe me.
COMPUTER VOICE=>Revised Destination: Office.
BURGESS=>John. Please. Listen to me --
ANDERTON=>I'm not getting halo'd.
BURGESS=>You can't run --
ANDERTON=>Everybody runs.
FLETCHER=>Don't worry. I'll bring him in unharmed.
WITWER=>Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that. I'm taking control of the team.
FLETCHER=>What?!
BURGESS=>Witwer, Fletcher is second in command. It's his show to run. You want, you can observe. Do it. Find him.
WITWER=>He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged. What did you talk about?
BURGESS=>The Mets. John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
WITWER=>Why are you protecting him? You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
BURGESS=>The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
WITWER=>Six years ago. What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
BURGESS=>None of your damn business.
WITWER=>Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar. Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy. He's my suspect.
BURGESS=>He's my subordinate!
WITWER=>Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
BURGESS=>I don't want John Anderton hurt.
ADVERTISEMENTS=>Stressed out John Anderton? Need a vacation? Come to Aruba! Challenge yourself, John! Push harder, John! It's not just a car, Mr. Anderton. It's an environment, designed to soothe and caress the tired soul...
WITWER=>You've all worked with him...
WITWER=>You may consider him a friend.
WITWER=>But we know that John Anderton is going to kill Leo Crow this Friday at three-o-six p.m., unless we stop him.
WITWER=>Don't think for a minute that if the situation was reversed he wouldn't go after you. He would be a cop doing his job, as I'm doing mine.
WITWER=>So if you're not ready and willing to put the halo on him, leave now.
EVANNA=>No, thank you.
WITWER=>You can go.
OFFICER=>Excuse me?
WITWER=>Go. You're dismissed. You, too. And you.
FLETCHER=>Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
WITWER=>Yes, I know.
WITWER=>These gentlemen are Federal Agents Jucket, Paymen, Price and Foley. Like you, I feel more comfortable with people I trust.
JAD=>I got him on the Metro! The train makes two stops, at 20th and then 33rd.
WITWER=>Split the units, go to both.
FLETCHER=>We'll never make 20th.
WITWER=>Have faith.
FLETCHER=>We know there's been a mistake, Chief. Come on back with us so we can talk, get this thing straightened out.
FLETCHER=>Don't run, Chief. You know we'll catch you. You trained us.
ANDERTON=>Everybody runs.
FLETCHER=>You don't have to do this, Chief.
ANDERTON=>You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
FLETCHER=>Chief, please...
KNOTT=>Easy does it, Chief.
WITWER=>Jad. Patch me into security.
ANDERTON=>Dr. Hineman --
IRIS=>You're trespassing.
IRIS=>Something wrong?
ANDERTON=>I'm a little dizzy...
IRIS=>Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
ANDERTON=>The what?
IRIS=>The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
IRIS=>It's not a true Doll's Eye, of course, but a little hybrid of my own design.
IRIS=>It's quite something, once the poison gets into your bloodstream, you'll start to see what I can only describe as the most extraordinary display of blue objects.
IRIS=>This just isn't your week, is it, Chief?
IRIS=>Now now...
IRIS=>You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
ANDERTON=>I'm... not... a... killer.
IRIS=>You better drink this. Soon you won't be able to swallow, and then you'll be totally buggered.
IRIS=>Drink all of it.
IRIS=>Take a moment to right yourself.
IRIS=>Just what is it you think I can do for you?
ANDERTON=>You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
IRIS=>And how would I know that?
ANDERTON=>You invented precrime.
ANDERTON=>What's so funny?
IRIS=>If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
ANDERTON=>You don't seem all that proud.
IRIS=>I'm not. I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
ANDERTON=>Heal who?
IRIS=>The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
ANDERTON=>You're talking about the precogs...
IRIS=>You think the three in the tank come from a test tube? They're merely the ones who survived.
IRIS=>I was doing genetic research at the Woodhaven Clinic in Rhode Island on Renning's Syndrome, a neurological condition that affects the cerebral cortex of children. Most of these kids were abandoned or forgotten. Very few of the kids lived past the age of twelve.
IRIS=>It began as play. A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right. And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same. They were all about murder. And the murders were all happening.
ANDERTON=>And how did Lamar become involved?
IRIS=>Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them. He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things. Precrime. The precogs. You.
ANDERTON=>You say some of the children died?
IRIS=>So many of them... despite what we did for them. Or maybe because of what we did to them. It doesn't matter. It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
ANDERTON=>I'm not a murderer. I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
IRIS=>And, yet, a chain of events has started. A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
ANDERTON=>Not if I stay away from him.
IRIS=>How can you avoid a man you've never met?
ANDERTON=>So you won't help me?
IRIS=>I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong.
IRIS=>But, occasionally, they do disagree.
ANDERTON=>What?
IRIS=>Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way. But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
ANDERTON=>Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
IRIS=>Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
ANDERTON=>Why?
IRIS=>Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility. After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt? It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
ANDERTON=>You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
IRIS=>I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
ANDERTON=>Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
IRIS=>I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime. Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
ANDERTON=>Answer my question. Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
IRIS=>Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
ANDERTON=>Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures? My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
IRIS=>The system would collapse.
ANDERTON=>I believe in that system...
IRIS=>Do you? Really?
ANDERTON=>You want to bring it down.
IRIS=>But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow. Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
ANDERTON=>I'm not gonna kill anybody.
IRIS=>Hold that thought.
ANDERTON=>Why should I trust you?
IRIS=>You shouldn't. You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself. Not the young federal agent who wants your job. Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created. Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report.
ANDERTON=>You said they're destroyed.
IRIS=>I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time. I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
ANDERTON=>What safe place is that?
IRIS=>The safest place of all.
ANDERTON=>Where?
IRIS=>Inside the Precog who predicted it. All you have to do is download it.
ANDERTON=>That's all, huh? Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
IRIS=>If... you have one.
ANDERTON=>-- and then walk out.
IRIS=>Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
ANDERTON=>You're insane or you think I am.
ANDERTON=>I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime. They'll pick me up...
IRIS=>Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
IRIS=>As a policeman -- excuse me, a former policeman -- I'm sure you know all sorts of people who could... help you out in this regard.
IRIS=>It's funny how all living organisms are alike. When the chips are down... When the pressure is on... ... every creature on the face of the earth is interested in one thing and one thing only:
IRIS=>It's own survival.
IRIS=>Find the Minority Report.
ANDERTON=>How do I even know which one has it?
IRIS=>It's always in the more gifted of the three.
ANDERTON=>Which one is that?
IRIS=>The female.
JAD=>He wasn't in here much. He preferred to be with the team.
KNOTT=>You seen the latest polls? We're dead even.
KNOTT=>Even since Chief America ran away, the numbers for Precrime have been goin' up. People feel better, they know we're willing to go after one of our own.
JAD=>More likely, people just want a show like this every week.
FLETCHER=>Here's where we're at. Three men in a room. The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
WITWER=>There's thousands of units like this one.
FLETCHER=>They're everywhere.
WITWER=>But he doesn't go there to kill Crow for another twenty-two hours. In the meantime, I'm betting he's somewhere in the sprawl.
WITWER=>Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket. There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
FLETCHER=>No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
WITWER=>Because he thinks he's innocent.
WITWER=>We concentrate on the sprawl. We do overflies in ships with two spyder teams on the ground. Go building by building. Thermal scan the whole area, read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.
LARA=>John -- stop filming me.
WITWER=>Where is she?
DR. EDDIE=>Have a seat, Chief...
DR. EDDIE=>Damn cold won't go away.
DR. EDDIE=>Don't worry. I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection. Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
ANDERTON=>That's comforting.
DR. EDDIE=>You do understand I can't just give you new irises. The scanners will read the scar tissue. Alarms will go off. Large men with guns will appear...
ANDERTON=>Right. I know --
DR. EDDIE=>Anesthesia. Try to relax, John. I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes. Completely.
ANDERTON=>Yeah --
DR. EDDIE=>And replace them with new ones.
ANDERTON=>I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
DR. EDDIE=>Why?
ANDERTON=>Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care? They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
DR. EDDIE=>Whatever you say, John.
DR. EDDIE=>Greta!
DR. EDDIE=>This is Miss Van Eyck, my gorgeous assistant.
ANDERTON=>Nice to meet you.
DR. EDDIE=>That's not much.
ANDERTON=>It's all I could safely move.
DR. EDDIE=>Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount. How's that sound?
DR. EDDIE=>You don't remember me, do you?
ANDERTON=>We know each other?
DR. EDDIE=>Oh, yes.
ANDERTON=>From where? D.C.?
DR. EDDIE=>Baltimore. Eastside. Solomon P. Eddie M.D. I was a plastic surgeon.
DR. EDDIE=>I specialized in burn victims. Women mostly.
ANDERTON=>I put you away --
DR. EDDIE=>Yes, you did.
ANDERTON=>You made those tapes...
DR. EDDIE=>They were performance pieces.
ANDERTON=>You set your patients on fire!
DR. EDDIE=>And put them out. Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we? The future is much more interesting than the past. Don't you think?
DR. EDDIE=>Lie down, John.
MISS VAN EYCK=>Hello.
ANDERTON=>Uh, hi --
DR. EDDIE=>Try to relax, Chief.
ANDERTON=>So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
DR. EDDIE=>How can I do what I do now? Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
DR. EDDIE=>It was a great way to avoid some of the more unpleasant aspects of prison life. Yes, confinement was a real education, a real eye opener if you will.
MISS VAN EYCK=>No no no...
DR. EDDIE=>I mean, for true enlightenment, John, there's nothing quite like the experience of, say, taking a shower while a large felon with a hard-on you can't knock down with a hammer whispers in your --
ANDERTON=>Uh, okay, you know what? I think maybe I'll just --
DR. EDDIE=>Yes, it was a lot of fun. Thank you so much, John, for putting me there. For giving me the opportunity to get to know myself better. And now...
DR. EDDIE=>To return the favor...
VOICE=>Lara?
WITWER=>My name is Danny Witwer. I'm --
LARA=>I know who you are.
WITWER=>This your work?
LARA=>Yes.
WITWER=>I like it.
LARA=>Thanks. You take anything in your coffee?
WITWER=>Cream and sugar.
LARA=>I don't have any cream. Sorry.
WITWER=>Just sugar then. You and John ever come here?
LARA=>We used to, every summer.
WITWER=>He's not here now, is he?
WITWER=>I had to ask.
LARA=>I don't have any sugar either.
WITWER=>Thank you. He hasn't tried to contact you?
LARA=>No.
WITWER=>You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
LARA=>No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
WITWER=>So you haven't seen his apartment?
LARA=>That was our apartment.
WITWER=>Have you been there recently?
WITWER=>It's full of these.
WITWER=>How long's he been doping?
LARA=>Since right after we lost our son.
WITWER=>You mean after he lost your son.
LARA=>It was nobody's fault.
WITWER=>But John was with him at the pool?
LARA=>Yes.
WITWER=>You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
LARA=>It wasn't a suicide attempt. I regret ever saying that.
WITWER=>What was it then?
LARA=>The FBI found something that belonged to my son. A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
WITWER=>He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies. This is all in your statement, Lara...
LARA=>He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what? You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
WITWER=>Not very well, I'm sure. I'd probably start doping myself. Or maybe I'd...
WITWER=>Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
LARA=>I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son. Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy. That's why I left him. And now you can leave.
WITWER=>You know I need to use you.
LARA=>To what? Trap him?
WITWER=>To prevent a murder. Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
LARA=>I haven't seen him in two years.
WITWER=>But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
WITWER=>He's still living with you. And your son. You have to choose, Lara. You have to choose sides now.
DR. EDDIE=>Don't take the bandages off for twelve hours. If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Do you understand?
DR. EDDIE=>There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
ANDERTON=>How do I find the --
DR. EDDIE=>Here --
DR. EDDIE=>It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
ANDERTON=>I can't even stand up --
DR. EDDIE=>I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
ANDERTON=>The nano... what?
DR. EDDIE=>Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs. But whatever you do, don't scratch.
DR. EDDIE=>Seeing as we're old pals and all, I'm giving you a bonus, might come in handy. Feel this.
DR. EDDIE=>It's a temporary paralytic enzyme. Shoot this baby under your chin. Right here...
DR. EDDIE=>The enzyme turns your facial muscles to mush. You won't look like the same man. You tighten up again in about thirty minutes. Hurts like nothing you ever felt. I'll just drop it in your goodie bag along with the uh...
DR. EDDIE=>... leftovers.
DR. EDDIE=>I'm setting up a timer. When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here. But not before then, or you'll --
ANDERTON=>-- go blind. I know.
DR. EDDIE=>A little something from our mutual friend.
VOICE=>That you, Chief?
DR. EDDIE=>I believe you know Lycon. I purchase my more hard to get pharmaceuticals from him. And, of course, once upon a time he was also a patient of mine. Like you.
LYCON=>Good luck, Chief.
SEAN=>How much time, Dad?
ANDERTON=>Twelve seconds. A new record.
SEAN=>Okay... now let me time you.
ANDERTON=>Are you kidding? There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
SEAN=>Come on!
ANDERTON=>All right, I'll try...
ANDERTON=>You better take this.
SEAN=>Okay -- Ready? Set... Go!
ANDERTON=>Sean?
ANDERTON=>Sean Anderton? Where are you?
ANDERTON=>SEAN!!
EVANNA=>Jad, we're now in position and ready to begin thermal scan on 931 Powell.
ANDERTON=>Shit!
KNOTT=>I'm thinking you must really like me, don't you, Fletcher?
KNOTT=>That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
FLETCHER=>I think you're swell company, Knott.
KNOTT=>It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief. That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
FLETCHER=>No, I just wanna watch him use your body to sandblast another building. That's all. Jeff.
EVANNA=>I show twenty-seven warm bodies.
FLETCHER=>What do you think, four spyders?
KNOTT=>Let's do eight. I'm hungry.
OLD WOMAN=>Nice to have some company...
OLD WOMAN=>See my new earrings? My grandson gave them to me. He's in beauty school --
KNOTT=>Hey, Fletcher. Check out the double reading. Coitus interuptus.
EVANNA=>Do you even know what that means?
MAN'S VOICE=>Oh -- man -- come on! You can't just barge in here!
WOMAN'S VOICE=>This is private property! You can't --
KNOTT=>People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
FLETCHER=>Knott!
FLETCHERÕS VOICE=>Please permit the spyder to scan you --
KNOTT=>Let's go, folks.
WOMANÕS VOICE=>There! Now get the hell out!
KNOTT=>One more...
EVANNA=>We lost one --
FLETCHER=>Cat maybe, went out the window.
EVANNA=>Awful big cat...
EVANNA=>Wait a minute...
EVANNA=>What do you think, guys, a drunk maybe, can't wake up?
FLETCHER=>Or a guy who doesn't want to get read. Stand by. We're gonna go take a look...
ANDERTON=>Please...
ANDERTON=>Oh, God...
KNOTT=>Let's eat.
KID=>Look at his eye --
WITWER=>Fletcher!
TOUR GUIDE=>The Precrime program began with a Federal grant in 2036, and today, six years later, the District of Columbia is now the safest city in America. Why? Because Precrime Works.
TOUR GUIDE=>Precrime has eliminated the need for traditional detectives, so that most of the work done here is about the verification of motive and the protection of the future victim...
ANDERTON=>Okay, one... two -- shit.
ANDERTON=>One two three...
KID=>Can we see the precogs?
TOUR GUIDE=>The three precogs have such a powerful gift, they have to be kept in peaceful seclusion so as not to be distracted from the outside world. This display should give you some idea of their daily life...
TOUR GUIDE=>The precogs get over eight million pieces of mail each year. That's more mail than Santa gets...
ANDERTON=>Oh, no...
ANDERTON=>No... no... no...
WITWER=>Take a look.
WITWER=>There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
FLETCHER=>Two?
WITWER=>There's the man in sunglasses outside the window... here... but there's someone else... here... in the mirror.
FLETCHER=>It's definitely female...
WALLY=>Hey!
WALLY=>What're you doing in here? I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave...
WALLY=>Careful there, old timer, you're gonna hurt yourself...
ANDERTON=>Wally, listen to me...
WALLY=>Do I know you? Who are you?
ANDERTON=>I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
WALLY=>Oh... Hi, John.
WITWER=>Who does that look like to you?
WITWER=>It's Agatha.
FLETCHER=>So this means --
WITWER=>He's coming here to get her.
WITWER=>Jad, ask the building who's come and gone in the last couple of hours...
ANDERTON=>Are these all of her previsions?
WALLY=>There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
JAD=>He was EYEdented five minutes ago in the maintenance area.
WITWER=>There any way into the temple from there?
WITWER=>No alarms. We don't wanna lose him. And call Wally. Tell him to get out of there.
JUCKET=>Chief, we got video on someone inside the temple.
WITWER=>What do you mean "Someone?"
JUCKET=>Looks like an old man.
ANDERTON=>Just go to the beginning!
WALLY=>Okay. Fine. Where the hell is that?
JAD=>Wally --
JAD=>Leave the temple now.
WALLY=>Uh -- no can do there, Jad...
ANDERTON=>What is it?
PAYMEN=>He's inside.
JUCKET=>Got some kind of mask on.
KNOTT=>We got four guys on the other door.
WITWER=>Do not fire any weapons inside the temple. Use only bindfoam or your sick-sticks. We go on my count...
AGATHA=>Can you see?
WITWER=>John -- move away from the tank!
WITWER=>Move away from the tank!
WITWER=>John --
WALLY=>Oh, God...
WALLY=>They've never been separated before.
WITWER=>What does he want with a precog?
WALLY=>What do you think? So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
WITWER=>But there's still the other two.
WITWER=>Wally, the other two can still function, right?
WALLY=>You don't understand... they're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
WITWER=>Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
WALLY=>Maybe if he'd taken one of the males. But the female, she's the key. She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent. The one who takes care of the other two.
WITWER=>Jesus...
WITWER=>Please, bring her back.
FLETCHER=>Find out where that pipe leads -- I want every team underground now!
WITWER=>It doesn't matter. He wins.
FLETCHER=>We can stop him.
WITWER=>She's in the room with him when he kills Crow. She's already a part of his future.
WITWER=>Put everything you've got into finding that room and we stop a murder. How much time have we got?
ANDERTON=>Are you cold?
ANDERTON=>Can you understand me?
ANDERTON=>It's the drugs. They'll wear off in a few hours.
ANDERTON=>I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information. I need to know how to get it. Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is? Can you tell me if --
AGATHA=>Is it now?
ANDERTON=>What?
AGATHA=>Is it now?
ANDERTON=>Yes... this is all happening right now.
AGATHA=>I'm tired... I'm tired of the future.
AGATHA=>I have to take you someplace, in public, which means I have to get you something... else to wear.
ANDERTON=>I'll hurry.
STORE VOICE=>Hello, Mr. Yakamoto! Welcome back to the Gap.
STORE VOICE=>How'd those assorted tank tops work out for you?
STORE VOICE=>Come on in and see how good you look in one of our new Winter sweaters.
AGATHA=>Nathan --
AGATHA=>Nathan!
AGATHA=>Come here.
BOY/NATHAN=>Do I know you?
AGATHA=>Hold my hand.
NATHAN=>What?
AGATHA=>Please, Nathan, hold my hand.
NATHAN=>Whoa --
NATHAN=>Who are you?
STORE VOICE=>Thanks for shopping at the Gap, Mr. Yakamoto.
ANDERTON=>Sayonara.
NATHAN=>Look, whoever you are --
AGATHA=>You can go now.
ANDERTON=>Excuse me.
JAD=>What's he want with a precog?
FLETCHER=>He knows we can't operate without her. He's gonna ransom her.
JAD=>Where's the note?
JAD=>If he's ransoming her, where's the damn note?
SEAN=>He, Dad! How's... your... day? Hey, look what I built! Thanks... for... helping... me... I... love you... Daddy.
WITWER=>It has nothing to do with ransom. It has to do with the information that's inside of her.
WITWER=>He's trying to prove his innocence.
FLETCHER=>He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
WITWER=>No. He can't...
WITWER=>Who's Rufus T. Riley?
RUFUS=>What's your pleasure?
RUFUS=>We got it all here. We got guys come in, want to experience sex as a woman. We got women come in, want to get laid by their favorite soap star. We got rape fantasies from both sides. We got sports fantasies. And then we got what I call the "Look Ma, I can fly" fantasies which encompass everything from bungee jumping to soaring like an eagle over the Grand Canyon.
RUFUS=>Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes. It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
CUSTOMER=>I wanna kill my boss.
RUFUS=>Uh-huh. Okay. You got some images I can work with?
CUSTOMER=>Right here.
RUFUS=>Good. What I can do is set you up down in the --
ANDERTON=>Rufus...
RUFUS=>Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
CUSTOMER=>No, I wanna kill my boss!
RUFUS=>Get the hell outta here. You sick bastard.
RUFUS=>Detective. Nice of you to come down here. Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now. Jesus, what's up with your eye?
ANDERTON=>I need your help.
RUFUS=>Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here. For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
ANDERTON=>I need help with her.
RUFUS=>Well, hello there, honey-pie.
RUFUS=>I'm impressed, Anderton. You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
ANDERTON=>Rufus. She's a precog.
RUFUS=>She's a precog?
ANDERTON=>That's right.
RUFUS=>You brought a Precog -- HERE? Jesus Christ...
RUFUS=>Are you reading my mind right now?
ANDERTON=>Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
RUFUS=>I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do! And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
ANDERTON=>She's got information inside of her. I need you to get it out.
RUFUS=>No. No way. I wouldn't even know where to begin! Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
ANDERTON=>C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
RUFUS=>So?
ANDERTON=>So now I need you to hack into her.
RUFUS=>I tell you what. I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
ANDERTON=>They don't belong to anybody.
RUFUS=>Then take her to Radio Shack.
ANDERTON=>Do I look like I'm leaving?
EVANNA=>No chewing gum on my ship.
RUFUS=>Okay, we're all set. I can't promise you the images are gonna be any good, though.
RUFUS=>Good God...
RUFUS=>You know what, Chief? On second thought I don't think I wanna keep any of these --
ANDERTON=>Stop --
RUFUS=>Tell me how.
PROJECTED CROW=>You're not going to kill me...
PROJECTED ANDERTON=>Good-bye, Crow.
ANDERTON=>Rufus -- can you record this?!
ANDERTON=>What happened? Where's the rest?
RUFUS=>I guess that's all of it.
ANDERTON=>Is there a Minority Report?
ANDERTON=>An alternate future. Do I have one?
AGATHA=>No.
AGATHA=>Can you see?
ANDERTON=>Anne Lively...
ANDERTON=>Why are you showing me this? What do you want me to see?
ANDERTON=>Rufus, play it back...
RUFUS=>Uh, I'll try...
ANDERTON=>What?
AGATHA=>They're inside.
ANDERTON=>Who?
RUFUS=>Your old Teammates.
WITWER=>Check every room.
RUFUS=>You come up just outside the sprawl on Millhouse.
AGATHA=>Can you see the umbrella?
AGATHA=>Take it.
ANDERTON=>Agatha...
AGATHA=>Can you see the man in the blue suit?
AGATHA=>He drops his briefcase.
AGATHA=>A woman in a brown dress is going to come out of the door up ahead.
AGATHA=>Wait -- she knows you face. Turn in here.
ANDERTON=>Agatha --
AGATHA=>Can you see the balloon man?
ANDERTON=>What?
AGATHA=>This way...
AGATHA=>Stop.
BUM=>May the Devil take you as his bride!
AGATHA=>Drop some money.
ANDERTON=>Forget that guy --
AGATHA=>Do it. Right here. On the ground.
BUM=>May God Bless You!
AGATHA=>No. Follow him.
ANDERTON=>He'll turn around.
AGATHA=>He won't.
ANDERTON=>Agatha...
AGATHA=>Wait.
AGATHA=>Can you see his shoe?
AGATHA=>Tie his shoe.
KNOTT=>He's not here. I'll check one block east.
ANDERTON=>Here you go, buddy...
KID=>I can do it myself!
ANDERTON=>Agatha. Can you see that?
ANDERTON=>That's the man in the window.
WITWER=>What was he looking for?
AGATHA=>Don't go inside.
AGATHA=>You don't have to. Walk away.
WITWER=>This is what he wanted to see?
RUFUS=>No... This is what she wanted him to see.
WITWER=>I'll need a copy of this.
CLERK=>Room's are ninety-five a night plus tax. Or fifteen an hour.
ANDERTON=>You mind if I take a look at your register?
CLERK=>Yeah, I mind --
ANDERTON=>How about now?
CLERK=>Help yourself.
ANDERTON=>He's here.
AGATHA=>Anderton, leave.
AGATHA=>You have a choice. Walk away. Right now.
ANDERTON=>I can't. I have to know.
AGATHA=>Please --
ANDERTON=>I have to find out what happened to my life. Agatha. I'm not going to kill the man. I don't even know him.
ANDERTON=>Don't you understand, going upstairs is the only way I'll ever find out what's underneath all of this. Who's setting me up. I have to know.
ANDERTON=>What room's Crow in?
CLERK=>Ten-o-six.
AGATHA=>He's gone.
ANDERTON=>Wait a minute...
ANDERTON=>It's the wrong room.
AGATHA=>Anderton...
ANDERTON=>Jesus...
ANDERTON=>Oh, God...
AGATHA=>What is it?
ANDERTON=>This is Sean. My son.
ANDERTON=>Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street. The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
AGATHA=>Anderton --
ANDERTON=>You were right. I'm not being set up.
ANDERTON=>I'm gonna kill this man.
AGATHA=>Please, I want to go back...
ANDERTON=>I can't leave. You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report. I don't have an alternative future.
AGATHA=>But you still have a choice. The others never had a chance to see their future. You did.
ANDERTON=>Leo Crow?
CROW=>Who... who... The hell are you?
ANDERTON=>Six years ago. Baltimore. You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
CROW=>Did I? I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
CROW=>Jesus --
ANDERTON=>Do you know who I am?
CROW=>Some -- somebody's father?
ANDERTON=>His name was Sean. Six years ago. Francis pool.
CROW=>I told him I was a policeman...
CROW=>... and that I needed his help. It wasn't so bad really. I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel. I took care of him. I made him happy.
ANDERTON=>He's alive?
ANDERTON=>Where've you got him? Is he all right? Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
CROW=>I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
CROW=>It floated back up. I had to take him out and --
ANDERTON=>NO!
CROW=>I'm sorry! I'm sorry...
AGATHA=>Anderton, you can choose... You can choose.
ANDERTON=>You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
ANDERTON=>You have the right to an attorney present now and during any future questioning. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights?
CROW=>You're not gonna kill me?
ANDERTON=>No.
CROW=>But you have to. They said you would.
ANDERTON=>The precogs were wrong.
CROW=>If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
CROW=>You're supposed to kill me. He said you would.
ANDERTON=>Who said I would?
CHILDREN=>He called me in Prison. Said if I went along, he'd get me released, take care of my family.
ANDERTON=>If you did what?
CROW=>Acted like I killed your kid.
CROW=>Look, I've put my family through enough misery. You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
ANDERTON=>Crow. I'm not gonna kill you.
CROW=>Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
ANDERTON=>I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
CROW=>I don't know -- I never saw his face. All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere. Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
ANDERTON=>What the fuck is going on?
AGATHA=>Anderton --
CROW=>Kill me!
ANDERTON=>What about the picture --
CROW=>Fake. He gave it to me. Now -- -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
ANDERTON=>Tell me, who was it, set this up?
CROW=>If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
ANDERTON=>Who made you do this?
CROW=>Kill me!
ANDERTON=>Tell me!
ANDERTON=>Let go of the gun.
CROW=>You're not gonna kill me...
ANDERTON=>Good-bye, Crow.
CROW=>Anderton! Wait -- don't --
ANDERTON=>Jesus --
AGATHA=>NO!
AGATHA=>Go...
WOMAN=>Murder!
WOMAN=>MURDER!
DIFFERENT VOICES=>Murder!!!
FLETCHER=>First murder in six years.
FLETCHER=>Jesus, they're never wrong, are they?
WITWER=>There a maid in this hotel?
FLETCHER=>I don't know, why?
WITWER=>If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
FLETCHER=>They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
WITWER=>What kind of cop were you before this?
FLETCHER=>I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
WITWER=>Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
WITWER=>I worked homicide before I went federal. This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence". Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
FLETCHER=>How many?
WITWER=>None. This was arranged.
ANDERTON'S VOICE=>Crow is dead.
LARA=>John?
ANDERTON'S VOICE=>He's dead, Lara.
LARA=>Oh, God, what did you do?
ANDERTON'S VOICE=>Nothing. I didn't kill him.
LARA=>Then how did he --
ANDERTON'S VOICE=>Lara, I don't know why this is happening. I just know they're setting me up. I can't trust anybody. I don't know who to talk to or where to go... Lara? Are you there?
LARA=>Yes, I'm here, John.
LARA'S VOICE=>I'm right here.
AGATHA=>Can you see? So beautiful...
AGATHA=>Where are we going?
ANDERTON=>Someplace safe.
AGATHA=>I have to go back.
ANDERTON=>Why?
AGATHA=>The other two will die without me.
ANDERTON=>You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
AGATHA=>I always wondered what the world would be like. But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more. It's all right. Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
ANDERTON=>Agatha, you're never going back there.
AGATHA=>I am going back. I see myself there.
AGATHA=>It's best, Anderton, if you don't think of me as human.
WIFE=>Danny Witwer's on the phone. He says it's important.
BURGESS=>What?
WITWER=>Lamar, I found something.
BURGESS=>What?
WITWER=>I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
BURGESS=>Where are you?
BURGESS=>Good God. What was that?
WITWER=>Wait, just a second...
WITWER=>We recovered that from Crow's hotel room.
BURGESS=>I remember when I gave this to him. Back in Baltimore. He was one of those cops, still thought he could make a dent in all the bad there was in the world.
BURGESS=>The irony is, sometimes it's the very vision that makes you want to make the world a better place that turns you into something you can't even recognize anymore.
BURGESS=>Tell me what you have.
WITWER=>This is the murder of a woman named Anne Lively.
BURGESS=>He told me about this. You got this from Containment?
WITWER=>Yes. This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel. Agatha's stream was missing. Now this one is from the cyberparlor. Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
BURGESS=>It's the same prevision.
WITWER=>Not quite.
WITWER=>Look at the surface wind across the water. Watch the ripples... moving away from shore.
WITWER=>Now the second image. Watch the water. The wind's changed. The ripples are going the other way.
BURGESS=>I don't understand --
WITWER=>This murder is happening at two different times.
WITWER=>According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
BURGESS=>I know. He came to me, told me about the missing data stream. He was concerned that you might find it.
WITWER=>I did find it. It was inside of Agatha all this time. So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
BURGESS=>Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
WITWER=>I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
BURGESS=>How?
WITWER=>By fooling the system. All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
BURGESS=>Yes... It's called an echo. The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
WITWER=>Precog Deja Vu...
BURGESS=>We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
WITWER=>So there is a way to fool the system?
BURGESS=>Yes.
WITWER=>Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
BURGESS=>Shhh. You know what I hear?
WITWER=>What?
BURGESS=>Nothing. No footsteps coming up the stairs. No hovercraft out the window. No clickity click of little spyders. No one crashing through that door. And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny? Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
BURGESS=>Burgess.
LARA=>Lamar, it's Lara.
BURGESS=>Yes, Lara.
LARA'S VOICE=>You have to help him.
BURGESS=>Is he there?
LARA=>Yes.
BURGESS' VOICE=>Has he got the precog with him?
LARA=>Yes.
BURGESS=>Keep them there. I'm on my way.
LARA'S VOICE=>Please don't tell Witwer. I don't trust him.
BURGESS=>I won't say a word. You just don't let John leave. All right?
LARA'S VOICE=>He's no killer, Lamar.
BURGESS=>I know.
ANDERTON=>It's all right. Lara, I want you to meet Agatha.
AGATHA=>I'm cold --
LARA=>Come inside.
ANDERTON=>I... just need to sit and think, figure this out.
ANDERTON=>It's like a bad dream. It's like I'm down the fucking rabbit hole.
LARA=>Oh, God, John... What have you done?
EVANNA=>ETA five minutes.
ANDERTON=>They used Sean. They wanted me to think Crow killed him --
ANDERTON=>-- but he didn't.
LARA=>Then who was he?
ANDERTON=>Just some guy... they found.
LARA=>Found? Where?
ANDERTON=>Somewhere.
LARA=>Think, John. Why would they set you up?
ANDERTON=>Because I found out about her...
LARA=>About who?
ANDERTON=>Anne Lively...
ANDERTON=>Agatha?
AGATHA=>Dr. Hineman once said to me that "The dead don't die." "They look on and help." Remember that, John.
AGATHA=>He's on the beach now, a toe in the water, asking you to come in with him. He's been racing his mother up and down the sand.
AGATHA=>There's so much love in this house.
AGATHA=>He's ten years old. He's surrounded by animals. He wants to be a vet. You keep a rabbit for him. A bird. And a fox.
AGATHA=>He's in high school. He likes to run. Like his father. He runs the two mile and the long relay. He's twenty-three, at a University. He makes love to a pretty girl named Claire. He asks her to be his wife. He calls here and tells Lara who cries... he still runs. Across the University. And in the stadium where John watches.
AGATHA=>Oh, God -- he's running so fast, like his daddy. He sees his daddy, wants to run to him, but he's only six years old and he can't do it. And the other man is so fast.
AGATHA=>There was so much love in this house.
ANDERTON=>I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
LARA=>I know... I do, too...
AGATHA=>So did she.
AGATHA=>Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back.
ANDERTON=>Who wanted her little girl back?
AGATHA=>The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.
ANDERTON=>She died?
AGATHA=>She grew up.
ANDERTON=>She's still alive?
AGATHA=>She's not alive, but she didn't die.
ANDERTON=>Oh, Jesus...
LARA=>John? What is it?
ANDERTON=>How did I not see this? Agatha, who killed you mother? Who killed Anne Lively?
AGATHA=>I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
ANDERTON=>What --
AGATHA=>RUN!
KNOTT=>John Anderton, by mandate of the District of Columbia, precrime division, I'm placing you under arrest for the murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer --
ANDERTON=>Witwer --
VOICE=>That's it... that's my girl...
WALLY=>I was so worried about you. Did he hurt you?
WALLY=>God, I missed you so much...
GIDEON=>You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
ANDERTON=>Lara --
GIDEON=>It's actually kind of a rush. They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes. That all your dreams come true.
ANDERTON=>Gideon -- GIDEON!
SEAN=>Dad? Wake up...
ANDERTON=>Sean -- you're not real.
SEAN=>You gotta have faith, Dad.
ANDERTON=>It's a little late for that.
SEAN=>Wanna hear something funny?
ANDERTON=>What the hell.
SEAN=>I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father. He took me all over the world.
ANDERTON=>You're alive?
SEAN=>No. He got tired of pretending.
ANDERTON=>Oh, Sean --
SEAN=>The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
ANDERTON=>Sean --
SEAN=>I feel bad about that. I need you to forgive me.
ANDERTON=>I forgive you.
SEAN=>Once I even told him I loved him.
ANDERTON=>I forgive you...
SEAN=>The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
ANDERTON=>I was looking for you...
SEAN=>I know that. I know you would have done anything to find me. I know you would have died for me.
ANDERTON=>I wanted to.
SEAN=>Good-bye, Dad...
ANDERTON=>Who are you?
SEAN=>I'm your son. I'm you.
ANDERTON=>Sean, wait...
SEAN=>Hold your breath, Dad...
BURGESS=>This is all my fault.
LARA=>No, it isn't, Lamar. There was nothing anyone could do.
BURGESS=>I thought you might want to have those.
BURGESS=>I haven't worn this damn thing in years. I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
LARA=>You look great.
BURGESS=>I knew he was having trouble for some time, and yet I did nothing about it.
SECRETARY=>The guy from USA Today is here.
BURGESS=>Tell him not now.
SECRETARY=>He just wanted a few minutes before --
BURGESS=>Not. Now.
BURGESS=>It's insanity around here.
LARA=>I thought you were retiring?
BURGESS=>I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here. This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
BURGESS=>I know how hard this all is for you, but you can at least find some comfort in the fact that John finally found the man who killed your son.
LARA=>Who's Anne Lively?
BURGESS=>Who?
LARA=>Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him.
BURGESS=>I don't know who that is.
LARA=>John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
BURGESS=>We know why John was tagged.
LARA=>He also said Crow was a fake.
BURGESS=>And Witwer? He was shot with John's gun inside John's apartment.
LARA=>Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
BURGESS=>Sean --
LARA=>No. That's what everyone thinks. John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
LARA=>He was serving a warrant on a murder suspect when the guy opened fire from inside. It was a good shooting. The department gave John a commendation for it. But John couldn't let it go. He'd say the man's name in his sleep. He didn't eat. It was all he talked about. It was all he thought about. He came to work for you because he thought if he could just stop that kind of thing from happening...
BURGESS=>I understand.
LARA=>No. I don't think you do. The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed? He didn't mention him. He didn't say his name even once.
BURGESS=>Lara, John was the best cop I ever knew, and in some ways, the best man. But the scars he carried around, well... I know that he'd want us to honor the good things we remember about him.
BURGESS=>But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
LARA=>Lamar --
BURGESS=>All right. Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
LARA=>Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
SECRETARY=>Sir, the press conference is starting.
BURGESS=>I'll be right there.
BURGESS=>We'll talk about this later. I'll come by the cottage.
LARA=>I'd like a word with my husband.
GIDEON=>You're not authorized. How did you get in here?
GIDEON=>Okee pokee... off we go...
REPORTER=>... today a six year experiment was deemed a success when all fifty states overwhelmingly ratified the National Precrime Amendment...
NASH=>The President feels, and I agree, that the best way to avoid any appearance of impropriety, or any kind of infighting was to create an entirely new entity...
NASH=>... and, of course, the only man qualified to run such an entity is Lamar Burgess... Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm urgently needed... uh, somewhere... else.
FLETCHER=>Why don't I feel like celebrating?
KNOTT=>Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
FLETCHER=>John Anderton was my friend!
KNOTT=>You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record. Six years, not one damn murder...
ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess, Director of the new, national Precrime.
SECRETARY=>Congratulations, sir.
BURGESS=>My God...
BURGESS=>How did you get this?
SECRETARY=>I padded your expense account for the last six months.
BURGESS=>Revolvers like this one were given to Generals at the end of the Civil War by their troops. The cylinders were loaded with six gold-plated bullets to symbolize the end of the destruction and death that had ripped the country apart for six years.
BURGESS=>With Precrime going national, maybe we can all look forward to a time when none of us have to discharge another firearm ever again.
BURGESS=>I think people forget that, for all the talk about the Precogs, Precrime is only as good as the men and women who support them...
BURGESS=>I'm grateful to you for all that you've done to make this happen. And I assure you that I won't forget you when bonus time comes around!
KNOTT=>Now that's cool.
BURGESS=>Now enjoy yourselves. That's an order!
SECRETARY=>You have an emergency call on your private line.
BURGESS=>Thank you. This is Burgess.
ANDERTON=>Hello, Lamar.
BURGESS=>John --
ANDERTON=>I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it. You've created a world without murder. So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
JAD=>A-room. Jad.
LARA=>John needs a favor...
ANDERTON=>All these years Agatha's had the truth locked inside of her -- the Minority Report. All these years she's the only one who knew what really happened...
ANDERTON=>... until last week when she took my hand and showed me the image of a drowning woman... an image that would eventually lead me back to you.
BURGESS=>I don't know what you're talking about, John.
ANDERTON=>I'm talking about Anne Lively. Just a junkie who had a kid once and had to give her up.
ANDERTON=>But, surprise, this junkie cleaned herself up.
ANDERTON=>And she wanted the kid back.
ANDERTON=>She wanted Agatha...
ANDERTON=>But you and Hineman had already turned the girl into something else: A Precog.
JAD=>Wally? You getting this?
WALLY=>Uh-huh...
ANDERTON=>And without her, there was no Precrime. She's always been the strongest of the three. And you know that without Agatha, you had nothing. Without her, you wouldn't be where you are now, standing there signing autographs...
WALLY=>It's a single stream, from the female only, with no time or incident data.
JAD=>Meaning?
WALLY=>Meaning whatever this is, it ain't the future. It already happened.
ANDERTON=>So now you had to get rid of Anne Lively, you had to find a way to shut her up... which presented a problem. How can you murder her without the precogs seeing it? Simple: you use the system against her.
ANDERTON=>You hired someone to kill her for you, knowing full well the precogs would see that murder.
ANDERTON=>You lured Anne Lively out to the lake with the promise of doing the right thing, reuniting her with her daughter...
ANNE=>Mr. Burgess?
AGATHA=>Run...
ANDERTON=>You even made the arrest yourself...
ANDERTON=>And then, when you were all alone...
ANNE=>Where's my daughter?
ANDERTON=>You killed her yourself in the same way the Precogs predicted your John Doe would kill her. You made the real murder look like an echo, knowing the tech would ignore it.
ANDERTON=>You fooled the other two precogs, but not Agatha.
ANDERTON=>She was going to see the murder of her own mother no matter what state you did it in, or how you tired to hide it.
AGATHA=>Run!
AGATHA=>Mama...
ANDERTON=>You still there, Lamar?
MALE FACE=>Murderer.
WALLY=>We got a Red Ball!
AGATHA=>Think about the lives that little girl saved.
BURGESS=>Think about the lives that little girl saved.
BURGESS=>Think about all the lives she will save?
BURGESS=>That little girl could have saved Sean --
ANDERTON=>DON'T YOU FUCKING SAY HIS NAME!
MALE PRECOG=>You used the memory of my dead son...
ANDERTON=>You used the memory of my dead son to set me up! That was the one thing you knew would drive me to murder.
ANDERTON=>What are you going to do now, Lamar?
MALE PRECOG=>How are you gonna shut me up?
ANDERTON=>How are you gonna shut me up?
BURGESS=>John, people have seen a future where they feel safe. If all it cost was the death of a former drug addict... Leave it alone, John. Leave it alone.
BURGESS=>Forgive me, John.
FLETCHER=>Oh, God --
BURGESS=>People want to believe in the system. That's the beauty of it...
ANDERTON=>Beauty? The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
BURGESS=>The precogs don't have to always work, John, just as long as people believe they do, that's enough.
FLETCHER=>Willard Hotel... Two minutes...
JAD=>Fletcher, I think you should stay with me.
KNOTT=>Not to worry, Gordon. I'll save your pal.
BURGESS=>My God, John, a few hundred years ago, they used to bleed the sick. Twenty years ago, you had a tumor, they'd cut it out of you, with a knife, for Christ's sake.
BURGESS=>Since then the focus of medicine has gone from cure to prevention. Well, now law enforcement is going the same way.
ANDERTON=>Lamar, it's over.
MALE PRECOG=>The question you have to ask is...
ANDERTON=>What are you gonna do now?
ANDERTON=>No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
BURGESS=>No doubt.
ANDERTON=>Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
ANDERTON=>What's the matter, Lamar? You see the problem, don't you? If you don't kill me, it means the precogs were wrong and Precrime is over. If you do kill me, you go away, but... it proves the system works. The precogs were right.
ANDERTON=>So what do you do?
EVANNA=>We're not gonna make it...
ANDERTON=>What's it worth? Just one more murder...
ANDERTON=>You'll rot in hell with a halo, but people will still believe in Precrime.
ANDERTON=>All you have to do now is pull the trigger like they said you would.
ANDERTON=>Except... You've seen your own future. Which means...
ANDERTON=>You can change it if you want to.
ANDERTON=>You still have a choice, Lamar...
BURGESS=>Yes, I have a choice... and I've made it.
BURGESS=>Forgive me, John.
BURGESS=>Forgive me...
