ALICE=>Is that for me?
ALICE=>A guest spot on some TV thing. Something Enemy.

ANNA=>Dad, a toast?! JOHN
PROFESSOR JOHNSON=>My name is Frederick Johnson, I’m an associate professor of cognitive science here at UCLA and I’m here to welcome today’s speaker who has just flown in from New York.
LYDIA=>It’s forgotten.
TIGHT CLOSE-UP OF ALICE=>THE DEPTH OF FIELD has become very shallow, completely isolating her from her surroundings. The normal University soundscape fades away disconcertingly. She looks from one building to another - from one person to another. Things swim momentarily into focus but there’s no context - no bigger picture. Her breathing starts to quicken. She ventures one way a few paces, up some stairs. Her breathing is rapid, her face flushed with fear. She puts her head down, forcing herself to focus.
JOHN=>How did it go?
ALICE=>Good, y’know...
JOHN=>You guys argue? ALICE
ALICE=>You didn’t. JOHN
DR. BENJAMIN=>Good. How old are you?
ALICE=>Um...John Black.
MOMENTS LATER=>Alice is peeling carrots. There’s the sound of someone coming in the front door.
ALICE=>Hi. Come on in.
TOM=>This is Jenny.
ANNA=>Mom! Merry Christmas!
ANNA=>Don’t spoil it.
ALICE=>Hi, I’m Alice. I’m so happy you could join us. JENNY
LYDIA=>You want white?
DR. BENJAMIN=>No cerebral vascular disease, no evidence of any stroke, no masses.
ALICE=>That’s not good.
ALICE=>John, it’s okay.
ALICE=>Yes, of course.
JOHN=>I hate it too. He sits opposite her.
JOHN=>Don’t say that. ALICE
ALICE=>It’s all women.

YOUR COMPUTER LABELLED BUTTERFLY=>INT. LIDO BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING Suddenly, Alice awakens. She’s been napping, curled up on a big old sofa. There’s the sound of waves. She looks around - a little disoriented. She sees a BOWL OF SHELLS on the table in front of her and a MEMORY IMPAIRED bracelet on her wrist. Slowly, she gets up and wanders towards the french doors. Stepping out on the balcony, she sees the ocean. EXT. LIDO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON Alice walks along the virtually abandoned beach. Down by the water’s edge, she takes in the massive beautiful landscape. MOMENTS LATER she is sitting on a rock. A hundred yards away, John comes running.
