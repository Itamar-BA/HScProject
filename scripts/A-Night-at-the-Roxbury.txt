DOUG=>Hey! You want to dance? No? Yes? Alright, don't worry about it.
STEVE=>Do you want to dance? You do? You don't? Not a problem.
DOUG=>Hey, you wanna...?
DOUG=>No? Maybe I'll see you later.
STEVE=>Hey, do you want to dance?
GIRL AT BAR=>No.
STEVE=>Alright, you know where I'll be.
DOUG/STEVE=>You want him? Me? Him? Me?
STEVE=>... Oh, you're okay?
DOUG=>Alright then.
STEVE=>Bartender, can I get a beer?
DOUG=>Barkeep, what do you have on tap?
STEVE=>Big guy, could I get a...
DOUG=>My man, how 'bout a...
STEVE=>S'cuse me, partner...
DOUG=>Yo, buddy, I was wondering... you know what? Don't worry about it.
STEVE=>Yeah, we're good.
HOT GIRL=>Get off me!
STEVE/DOUG=>Score!
STEVE/DOUG=>What? What's goin' on? What's your problem?
DOUG=>We got some sweetness on the left.
STEVE=>What's up?
DOUG=>How you ladies doin' tonight?
DOUG=>Yeah! Just follow us!
STEVE=>No. You have beautiful eyes!
DOUG=>I like you too!
STEVE=>Okay, we'll meet you there.
BOUNCER=>Stop!
DOUG/STEVE=>What's up?
BOUNCER=>Guys, this is the Roxbury. No one gets in unless you're on the list.
DOUG=>We're on the list.
BOUNCER=>Names?
DOUG=>Doug Butabi.
STEVE=>Steve Butabi.
BOUNCER=>You're brothers?
DOUG=>No...
DOUG/STEVE=>... Yes!
BOUNCER=>Quite a joke.
STEVE=>Doug is hilarious.
DOUG=>Yeah, I know.
BOUNCER=>Yeah, you ever hear this one? You're not on the list.
STEVE=>Is that...?
DOUG=>It is. The King of '21 Jump Street.' Richard Grieco.
STEVE=>Check the wheels.
DOUG=>Check the hottie.
DOUG=>Alright, we'll see you later then! You know what? We're gonna take off now.
STEVE=>Maybe we'll hang out later.
BOUNCER=>There's no chance of that happening.
STEVE=>Sounds good.
DOUG=>You know what was wrong with that place.
STEVE=>It's hard to say, since we didn't get in.
DOUG=>It's just a poorly run operation. They can't properly evaluate the incoming clientele.
STEVE=>I thought we just didn't look cool enough.
DOUG=>C'mon. You? You're a beautiful man. I tell you what I'd do if it were my club. I would treat all the outside wannabes just as well as any legendary former television star.
STEVE=>That's pretty Roosevelt of you.
DOUG=>It's just what I believe in.
DOUG=>Must be the new dance mix version.
POLICE OFFICER=>Pull over to the side of the road!
POLICE OFFICER=>You know you were doing fifty?
STEVE=>What?
POLICE OFFICER=>This is a twenty-five mile an hour zone.
DOUG=>Hottie cop likes you.
STEVE=>You serious?
DOUG=>You think she pulls over anybody? Mave a move.
STEVE=>What's going on?
POLICE OFFICER=>Not much, I'm just giving you an eighty dollar ticket.
DOUG=>She is so into you.
POLICE OFFICER=>Can I see your license and registration?
STEVE=>I think I got what you're looking for.
DOUG=>She's calling her friends.
STEVE=>Seriously?
DOUG=>Here she comes.
STEVE=>How's my hair?
POLICE OFFICER=>I want you to do me a favor.
STEVE=>Whatever you say, TJ Hooker.
POLICE OFFICER=>Please obey any and all posted speed limit signs. Have a good night.
STEVE=>It's already good, now that you've served and protected me.
DOUG=>Way to go, my friend. You got her badge number plus a month from now you have a date to meet her at the Municipal State Court. Up top!
DOUG/STEVE=>Score!
DOUG=>This is what it's all about.
SECURITY GUY=>Folks, we got to keep this area clear!
STEVE=>There's a good feeling in here.
ANOTHER SECURITY GUY=>People, there's no lingering by the exits!
STEVE=>Doug?... Hey, Doug!... Whoa!
DOUG=>Steve!
STEVE=>Doug!
DOUG=>Steve!
STEVE=>Doug!
STEVE=>Hello?
DOUG=>Steve, it's Doug.
STEVE=>Oh, hey, Doug. So, what's going on?
DOUG=>Not much. Where are you?
STEVE=>I don't know. Where are you?
DOUG=>There's a lot of guys pulling down their pants, so it's either the bathroom or the V.I.P room. Meet me back at the bar. If I don't make it, I'll see you tommorow at home.
DOUG=>Hey, just hold on a second.
DOUG=>So, anyway, I'm standing there waiting to use the pay phone...
STEVE=>Yeah, he was. Seriously.
DOUG=>And this guy who's on the phone turns around and tips his hat like this.
STEVE=>And who do you think the guy was?
DOUG=>Emilio Estevez.
STEVE=>The Mighty Duckman. Swear to God. I was there.
DOUG=>Of course, you were. You're the one who yelled the breakfast clubber's name.
STEVE=>I was like -- 'Emilioooo!'
DOUG=>So, anyway... you guys want to make out or what?
DOUG=>Score some chippage. I'll meet you in there.
DOUG=>Hey!
DOUG=>Hey, she's totally looking at you.
STEVE=>Who?
DOUG=>Ask her where the chips are.
STEVE=>But, I know where they are.
STEVE=>Excuse me, I'm looking for the potato chips. You know, chips made out of potato.
CASHIER=>They're right behind you.
STEVE=>Wow, you really know what's going on, don't you?
DOUG=>Steve, look.
DOUG=>Hey.
RICHARD GRIECO=>... Hey.
DOUG=>Remember us? We were at the Roxbury.
STEVE=>We were outside?
RICHARD GRIECO=>Could I get a pack of Marlboro Lights and that 12-pack of Trojans. Thanks.
CASHIER=>Thanks.
STEVE=>Yeah, I think I'm gonna need a 12- pack of Trojans over there.
CASHIER=>You know, they expire in two years.
DOUG=>That nabob has got it going on.
STEVE=>Kickin' it at the Roxbury, rollin' a banana Ferrari.
DOUG=>Tasty geisha by his side.
STEVE=>The man is a bag of chips.
DOUG=>All that and a bag of chips.
STEVE=>Right. Well, we're doing okay. I got a number tonight.
DOUG=>Let me see it!
DOUG=>555...? Steve, this isn't real. It's one of those fake T.V. numbers.
STEVE=>Is not.
DOUG=>Is, too. I get this number all the time.
STEVE=>At least she respected me enough to write a fake number. We'll get a real one one of these days.
DOUG=>One of these days? Steve, don't you get it? These are our days. Now! Today! Ahora!
STEVE=>Ah whatta?
DOUG=>Steve, we're young. We're supposed to purge ourselves of the party virus or we'll just get so clogged up that when we're like forty we'll just explode.
STEVE=>Yeah, like one of those individual plastic butters you get in the diner. You know, like when you squish it, just bursts out all over the place.
DOUG=>Forget the butter, Steve. I'm trying to explain --
STEVE=>Or like when you put an egg in a microwave and all the yellow stuff flies out.
DOUG=>That's an exceptional way to visualize it but listen to me.
STEVE=>Oh! Remember in camp when we put that can of beans in the fire?
DOUG=>And it exploded. Yes. Steve! If we're ever going to live up to our full potential, we've got to get this partying out of our systems now.
STEVE=>Let's do it.
DOUG/STEVE=>Alright, let's do it! Do it! Woo!
STEVE=>... Do what? Everything's closed.
DOUG=>Then let's go home.
STEVE=>Let's go home! Wooo!
DOUG=>Hey! Knock it off!
STEVE=>Twizzled you, my friend.
DOUG=>Yeah, you totally got me.
DOUG=>That was in my nose.
MR. BUTABI=>Captain! Tenille! Stop that!
MR. BUTABI=>Look at this. Barbara, look who's honoring us with their presence.
DOUG/STEVE=>Ma!... come on.
MRS. BUTABI=>Here...
DOUG=>Mom, I'm trying to get my body to enter the zone, so I can optimize my fat-burning potential, and orange juice does not help!
STEVE=>Doug, according to 'Fit for Life' the idea of a balanced breakfast is a fallacy. Your body is only prepared to accept one form of food in the A.M. -- fruit.
DOUG=>You can putrefy your insides if you want to. But, I'm having a cup of cooked oatmeal, one tablespoon protein power...
DOUG=>... and four soy sausage links. That's how you hit your peak.
MR. BUTABI=>Quick, Barbara, look at Doug. He is hitting his peak. You don't want to miss this.
MRS. BUTABI=>Honey, if you're going to hit your peak, do it in your room.
STEVE=>All I want for breakfast is some sliced mangos and persimmons.
MR. BUTABI=>That's enough, you two. Your mother is not the maid.
STEVE=>No, can you tell the maid I want some sliced mangos and persimmons?
MR. BUTABI=>I want you both at work in half an hour. And, Steve wear something nice. Emily's back from school.
DOUG=>Excuse me, Dad, but I think you're confusing Steve for someone who gives a flying rat's ass.
STEVE=>Wow, a flying rat's ass. That would be wild to see.
MRS. BUTABI=>Kamehl, they'll be there. Just let them have their breakfast.
MR. BUTABI=>Sure. Eat. They need their strength so they can stay out all night for their dancing and their orgies.
STEVE=>For your information, Dad, Doug and I were not able to find an orgy last night.
MR. BUTABI=>Barbara, explain something to me. They graduate from high school and what do they do? Nothing. Do they go to college? No. Do they take any intrest in my business? No. Do they think about the future? No.
DOUG=>Dad, if you know all the answers, why do you keep asking the questions?
MR. BUTABI=>Half an hour. I want to see your dance club asses at the store.
WOMAN=>Jerks.
CAPPUCINO SALESMAN=>Single or double?
STEVE/DOUG=>Double.
MR. BUTABI=>Good. Steve, you have a customer. Doug, go ring that man up.
DOUG=>How will you be paying for this? Cash, check or charge?
MAN=>Charge.
DOUG=>Visa, Mastercard, or Discover?
MAN=>Move your thumb.
DOUG=>Oh... Visa. Good one.
DOUG=>I think something's wrong with your card. You sure this is yours? 'Cause it's not processing.
MAN=>It's my card.
DOUG=>I better call it in.
DOUG=>Operator 238 please.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Authorization. Card number?
DOUG=>What's up?
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Doug, I told you not to call anymore.
DOUG=>I got to get an approval.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>The card's fine.
DOUG=>Not the card, sweetness. Me.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Shut up and swipe it.
DOUG=>I can go for that.
DOUG=>... that feel good? 'Cause I could swipe it all night.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>It's fine. Good-bye.
DOUG=>... Oh, can I help you with something?
STEVE=>Excuse me, may I show you around the Silk Garden. Home of a wondrous variety of flora and fauna -- all made of silk.
STEVE=>That's what people will say. But guess what?
STEVE=>... it's not real. It's silk. Oh, be careful!
STEVE=>You've accidentally wandered into the Enchanted Forest. Allow me to be your guide.
STEVE=>You know what I just did?
STEVE=>I just watered your plant for a whole year.
DOUG=>What's up? You want to dance? With you. Oh, God, yes.
MR. BUTABI=>What are you doing?
DOUG=>Not much.
MR. BUTABI=>You don't spend enough time in dance clubs? You have to cut up my plants, and make toys of them?
DOUG=>This club had a jungle theme.
MR. BUTABI=>Carlos! Come work the cash register. You get your brother and load the truck.
EMILY=>Steve! Steve!
DOUG=>Don't look!
EMILY=>Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.
STEVE=>Hey, Emily.
DOUG=>Whatever.
STEVE=>So, I guess you're back from school and working in the lamp store again.
EMILY=>Yeah, I missed you.
DOUG=>Pardon me. I got to talk to my brother a second.
DOUG=>What, do you like her or something?
STEVE=>No.
DOUG=>Then why are you talking to her?
STEVE=>She's talking to me.
DOUG=>Steve, look at me. It is your destiny to be with a variety of lady girls. Not just one lamp store troll. And quite frankly, your level of looks is way above her level of looks. So for her own good, just walk away.
STEVE=>You are so smart.
DOUG=>That's why I'm here.
EMILY=>So, Steve, you gonna ask me out 'cause I think we could have a really good time...
STEVE=>Yeah, that sounds good.
DOUG=>Back off, chicklet!
EMILY=>What's your problem. Doug?
DOUG=>Emily, I don't know if you know this, but my brother and I? We live life in the fast lane. That means no stop signs, no red lights, and no pulling over to take pictures. Now you see this man over here?
STEVE=>What's up?
DOUG=>He's my co-pilot on this magic carpet ride. It's a two-man operation. One -- two -- -- crowd.
EMILY=>Shut up, Doug.
DOUG=>Sh! I just don't want you to get hurt.
MR. BUTABI=>Emily!
EMILY=>Hi, Mr. Butabi.
MR. BUTABI=>You know my son, Steve, here, likes you.
STEVE=>Dad, come on!
FRED=>Mr. Butabi, is Steve asking Emily to marry him again? Ha, ha.
MR. BUTABI=>Ha, ha, with the way they carry on, I think they're already planning their honeymoon, Mr. Anderson.
FRED=>Ha. Ha. Did I tell you? I've already booked a wedding band.
MR. BUTABI=>Ha. Ha. Yes, and if they have enough grandchildren we won't have to hire salesmen anymore. Ha, ha, ha...
FRED=>Kamehl, you kill me.
MR. BUTABI=>No, you kill me. You murder me.
FRED=>... salesmen. That's great.
DOUG=>Dad, can you just leave Steve alone?
MR. BUTABI=>What? Your brother likes the girl.
DOUG=>No, he doesn't.
STEVE=>No, I don't.
DOUG=>Dad, nothing personal, but Emily's like a pigwoman from a planet of pig people. And she's trying to take Steve on her porky little spaceship so she can take him back to the Planet Pig!
STEVE=>Hey, Doug, you know what they eat on the Pig Planet? Bacon and sausage.
DOUG=>Nice call.
STEVE=>Every once in a while I'll hit pay dirt.
MR. BUTABI=>This is all too bad, because that girl is going to be his wife.
DOUG=>No, she's not.
STEVE=>You know, they could also eat ham.
MR. BUTABI=>Enough of pig talk. Doug, do you see this wall? When they marry, we can knock it down. Then combine stores and have the first plant/lamp store. And Steve and Emily can run it and it's up to them if they want to keep you around.
DOUG=>Are you seeing planes? Is your name Tatu? Because I think you're living on Fantasy Island.
STEVE=>God, that was a sweet show.
MR. BUTABI=>Yes, I have a fantasy. That I have two capable sons who listen to me. Look how you load the truck. You've done enough damage for one day. Get out of here. I'm sick of both of you!
STEVE=>So, we're on a break?
DOUG=>I guess.
STEVE=>You want to Crunch it?
DOUG=>Sure, I'll Crunch.
DOUG=>What's up, Stacey?
STEVE=>Patty, work it.
PATTY=>Shut up.
DOUG=>Ritchie, you're the man.
RITCHIE=>Fuck off.
WOMAN=>What?
STEVE=>Tom-meee!
STEVE=>Catch you later.
DOUG=>Excuse me, can the rest of us use the mirror?
DOUG=>How's my form?
STEVE=>Looking good. Relax the shoulders... breathe through it... lift don't swing... feel the burn... stitch in time... and let me hear this one...
DOUG=>Aaaaaaaaah!
DOUG/STEVE=>Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
DOUG=>Sweet pump. Got some veinage going.
DOUG=>Ask me what time it is.
STEVE=>But I know what time it is.
DOUG=>Hotties.
STEVE=>Oh... Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
DOUG=>Sure, Let me check my watch.
DOUG=>I... think it's... quarter three.
DOUG=>Ladies love triceps.
CRAIG=>Doug! Steve! What's up?
DOUG/STEVE=>Craig!
CRAIG=>Looking large, gentlemen. You guys want the rest of my power bar?
DOUG=>No, we got a Nitro bar.
CRAIG=>How 'bout an Energy Booster Bar?
STEVE=>No, we got a Muscle Triplicator Bar.
CRAIG=>Okay, but let me know if you need some carbs. I got a case of 'carbolicious' in the back. But supplements aside, can I get some quality time with you fellas?
DOUG=>We're in between sets. Lay it on.
CRAIG=>How long we been friends?
STEVE=>All seven years of high school.
CRAIG=>That's right. That's why I got to be real with you now. And I'm not gonna sugar coat it. As a professional trainer, I'm a little worried about your pecs. You guys don't go all the way down. It's called full extension. And I'm not seeing it.
DOUG=>Craig, you're right. We actually had a long talk about that the other night.
CRAIG=>I just don't want you to cheat yourselves. I'm sorry I had to come down on you like this, but in a weird way, that's my job.
DOUG=>Hey, that's why we love you and we hate you.
CRAIG=>Still friends?
STEVE/DOUG=>You know it.
CRAIG=>I'm glad we had this talk.
STEVE=>Hey, we don't talk, we do.
AEROBICS TEACHER=>Okay, everybody, I'm Shelley. Are you ready to Cardio-Funk?
CROWD=>Yeah!
DOUG=>No!... Yes!
STEVE=>Oh, man, you are hilarious.
AEROBICS TEACHER=>Okay! Here comes the countdown! Three... two... one!
AEROBICS TEACHER=>... and kick!
AEROBICS TEACHER=>... and reach.
DOUG=>Alright! Yeah!
STEVE=>Cardio-funk!
DOUG=>Thank you, Shelley!
DOUG/STEVE=>... what's up?
STEVE=>Should we go back to work?
DOUG=>Probably.
STEVE=>What do you want to do?
DOUG=>We shaked it, let's bake it.
STEVE=>Water.
DOUG=>Where?
STEVE=>There.
DOUG=>Right.
STEVE=>You know, I told Dad we should put some ferns and some silk banana trees in front of the store. 'Cause then passersby and the like could see 'em and we could attract more customers.
DOUG=>Moonwalk that by me again?
STEVE=>I just said I was talking to Dad about the store and...
DOUG=>The store? You're sitting around thinking about the store?
STEVE=>Yeah.
DOUG=>Why?
STEVE=>That's where we work.
DOUG=>That's right. And is that all you want to do with your life? Is that all you think we're capable of doing --
DOUG=>What's up?
STEVE=>Want to go for a swim or what?
DOUG=>... about quarter after... five
DOUG=>-- capable of doing with our lives!
STEVE=>Hey, Doug, why are you Mt. St. Helensing on me?
DOUG=>Because I want more for you. I care about you.
STEVE=>That is so sweet of you.
DOUG=>I know. And you deserve better. You deserve to get into the Roxbury.
STEVE=>Doug, there's a list. You have to be like a Richard Grieco type guy.
DOUG=>Steve, we are the Richard Grieco type guys. We should be on that list. We're 'A' club people leading a 'B' club life.
STEVE=>We've been going to 'B' Clubs? Why didn't you ever tell me this?
DOUG=>I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I know how sensitive you are.
DOUG=>'Cause we settle. 'Cause we keep going to all those 'B' clubs ever night They can smell 'B' club on us like barf in a bathroom. From now on, the only club we go to is the Roxbury.
STEVE=>But, how --
DOUG=>But, nothing.
STEVE=>We can't --
DOUG=>We can. And we will. Because no matter how many lists and roped off areas the big bouncer in the sky throws in front of us, we will get through. You know why?
STEVE=>We're good-looking?
DOUG=>Very good-looking. You especially. Now, repeat after me.
STEVE=>'After me.' Sorry. I'm just kidding.
DOUG=>And it was hysterical. I'm just not laughing to preserve the drama of the previous moment.
STEVE=>Understood. Continue.
DOUG=>Repeat after me. We can get in the Roxbury.
STEVE=>We can get into the Roxbury.
STEVE/DOUG=>Roxbury! Roxbury! Roxbury!
DOUG/STEVE=>What's up?
MR. BUTABI=>... And then, and I swear this is true, someone came into the store today and thought it was a real plant store.
MABEL=>No?
MR. BUTABI=>I would not kid about that.
MR. BUTABI=>Hello?
DOUG=>Hey.
STEVE=>What's up?
MR. BUTABI=>The Andersons here. Get dressed and come join us.
STEVE=>Okay.
DOUG=>Steve! Sorry, Dad, we're busy tonight.
EMILY=>I like your bathing suit, Steve.
STEVE=>Thanks Emily.
DOUG=>Steve, again!
STEVE=>I mean, whatever, Emily.
DOUG=>Nice to see you, folks.
MR. BUTABI=>Excuse me a minute.
MR. BUTABI=>If I tell you to do something, you do it. And what is this business of coming in naked. Put on your pants and come down.
DOUG=>Ain't on our 'Things to do' list. Daddy-o. Steve and I have something extremely important to do tonight.
MR. BUTABI=>Yes, to come downstairs.
DOUG=>Dad!
MR. BUTABI=>Why can I not get through to him?
STEVE=>Dad, Doug is like a fax machine. You just keep putting things in, face down, and you need to have a cover page, because if you don't -- people don't know where it's coming from and sometimes you don't get through on the first call. That's why you got a redial button and a memory button because... you know... actually, I never use those buttons. I always screw it up. I don't know.
DOUG=>Don't try to explain it to him. He'll never understand.
MR. BUTABI=>Oh, I understand. You are going out tonight.
DOUG=>That's right.
MR. BUTABI=>I just don't understand what you're driving.
DOUG/STEVE=>Hey! Dad! What are you doing!
EMILY=>'Memories, all alone in the moonlight...'
DOUG=>You can take away our phones. You can take away our keys. But, you can't take away our dreams!
STEVE=>That's right. 'Cause we're like sleeping when we have them.
DOUG=>Later much.
STEVE=>Emily, nice voice.
DOUG=>Steve!
MRS. BUTABI=>Boys! Boys!
MRS. BUTABI=>I don't like you going out without a phone. What if something happens?
DOUG=>Ma, these are embarrassing.
MRS. BUTABI=>Take it in case of emergency.
DOUG=>Did Ma get lipstick on me?
STEVE=>Yeah, but it looks like you were making out.
DOUG=>Oh, good.
DOUG=>Steve, how's my hair?
STEVE=>Looks good.
DOUG=>Roxbury good?
STEVE=>You know it. How do I look?
DOUG=>Robust and attractive. I gotta tell you -- tonight, I can taste it.
STEVE=>I can't taste it, Doug! I can't! I'm so scared right now I don't know what to do!
DOUG=>Bro, you're mad cowing on me. Relax.
STEVE=>I'm nervous, man. We've put all this pressure on ourselves to get into the Roxbury, and I don't know if we can deliver!
DOUG=>You gotta take control of yourself.
STEVE=>No, you gotta take control! I am barely hanging on here!... You...
DOUG=>Whoa... settle down... relax... think puppies and candy canes... easy...
DOUG=>What's up?
STEVE=>How you doing, little lady?
DOUG=>Alright. Maybe later then.
STEVE=>Doug, I see your Roxbury balloon, and I hate to be the one to burst it. I just don't think our names are on that list.
DOUG=>Steve, get real. The bouncer isn't checking a list. He's checking us. Man, I can't believe all this time, that's what you thought.
STEVE=>So, why didn't we ever get in before?
DOUG=>We were kids. We were completely immature.
STEVE=>But that was last night. And now we don't even have our car.
DOUG=>Perfect. Rites of passage. Like that Africa show on P.B.S. When it's time for a boy to become a man, they send him to the jungle with nothing but a spear to hunt the lion The van is our spear and the Roxbury is our lion. And when the hunt is over, we shall be men.
STEVE=>Does the bouncer know about this?
DOUG=>Look, Steve, what really matters is that at the end of the night -- when all is said and done and all hotties have been hit upon -- if either of us has just one girl's number, just one, then we'll know, for the first time in our lives, we're really worth something.
DOUG=>Storm the castle.
STEVE=>Take no prisoners.
DOUG=>Hey, my good hombre, remember us from last night?
BOUNCER=>No.
STEVE=>Doug and Steve Butabi.
BOUNCER=>You're brothers?
DOUG/STEVE=>No... Yes!
STEVE=>Works every time.
BOUNCER=>Now, I remember. You can't come in.
DOUG=>Okay, it's time to play a little softball.
DOUG=>Hello, my good man. How's it going tonight?
BOUNCER=>Good. You're still not getting in.
DOUG=>Well, that's not what a good friends of mine told me. Maybe you know him? His name is Abraham.
DOUG=>You don't know him?
STEVE=>How 'bout his two friends? George Washington and... George Washington?
DOUG=>Let's not forget the other boy in the band, Mr. Hamilton. He's a little lonely, wants to join his buddies.
STEVE=>Wait up, look what we got here...
STEVE=>Mr. Jefferson, Jefferson, Lincoln...
DOUG=>...Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, and a commemorative coin -- '84 Olympics -- what a proud chapter in Angelino history.
DOUG=>There's one!
STEVE=>That's not an A.T.M. That's where you drop off your videos.
DOUG=>Wait, there's one!
RICHARD GRIECO=>Oh, shit! The car.
BLONDE MODEL=>Car? What about me?
RICHARD GRIECO=>No, this car is illegal. All I need is a police report.
BLONDE=>What do you mean?
RICHARD GRIECO=>It's a racing car. I imported it illegally.
STEVE=>You okay?
DOUG=>Let me see...
RICHARD GRIECO=>Ah, great. They're starting in with the neck injuries. I'm screwed.
RICHARD GRIECO=>Hey, sorry about your car.
DOUG=>No way. Richard Grieco!
STEVE=>Remember, we saw you last night?
DOUG=>Like Walt Disney says, my man, 'It's a small world after it all.'
RICHARD GRIECO=>So, are you guys alright?
STEVE=>My neck hurts.
RICHARD GRIECO=>Right, so, what do you want to do?
DOUG=>We were just going to the Roxbury again.
STEVE=>But we couldn't get in.
RICHARD GRIECO=>Hey, you guys want me to get you in the Roxbury?
DOUG/STEVE=>Yeah!
RICHARD GRIECO=>Great. Follow me.
STEVE=>This is amazing.
DOUG=>See? It all comes from within. And he felt it. Because he's an actor and he's very sensitive.
DOUG=>Put in 'D' and blast me.
RICHARD GRIECO=>We got to make a stop at the Roxbury.
BLONDE MODEL=>What about the party?
RICHARD GRIECO=>I don't want a lawsuit, okay?
DOUG=>Steve, keep it together. Think F-R-A. Focus, rhythm, attitude.
STEVE=>Got it... Fra.
BOUNCER=>Mr. Grieco. Nice to see you.
RICHARD GRIECO=>I got two.
DOUG=>That's right. We're with Richard Grieco.
STEVE=>That's right. Grieco!
STEVE=>Oh my God, Doug, this is the most amazing place I've ever been.
RICHARD GRIECO=>Hey guys! This is the coat room. The club's in here.
STEVE/DOUG=>...Sweet.
DOUG=>Whats' up?
STEVE=>What's up?... What's up, what's up, whats' up, what's up, what's up...
DOUG=>Steve! Get a hold of yourself.
STEVE=>Sorry, it's hottie overload in here.
DOUG=>Pace yourself.
STEVE=>... What's up?... two, three... What's up?
MR. ZADIR=>Richard, my man! Good to see you.
RICHARD GRIECO=>Benny. Place is kickin'.
MR. ZADIR=>Actually, it's jumping. Like '21 Jump Street,' right? Ha! My children watch the reruns on T.V. land. Who are your friends?
RICHARD GRIECO=>Oh, guys, this is Mr. Zadir. He owns this place. These are uh..
DOUG=>Doug Butabi.
STEVE=>Steve Butabi.
MR. ZADIR=>Let me show you my V.I.P. table.
DOUG=>Oh my God! The owner.
STEVE=>I know!
DOUG=>He's the man who pulls the strings. The Gepetto of party.
STEVE=>Plus, he's the owner.
DOUG=>Sh! Listen and learn, my friend.
MR. ZADIR=>Yes! I see you! Excuse me, I have to say hello to Bob Saget.
RICHARD GRIECO=>So, you guys come here a lot?
DOUG=>Yeah, all the time.
STEVE=>But, we're never been inside.
DOUG=>Steve, what are you saying, be cool. So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here or what?
RICHARD GRIECO=>No. So you guys look like you really know how to party.
DOUG=>Oh, yeah, we never stop.
STEVE=>We're pretty much out of control.
MR. ZADIR=>I get it, Bob, the club is crowded, so it's a 'Full House' like your show. He's too much.
RICHARD GRIECO=>Benny, we'll see you at the party. I'll see you guys.
DOUG/STEVE=>See ya. Richard Grieco!
RICHARD GRIECO=>Their necks looked alright, right?
DOUG=>Sir, I just want to say, and I mean this with the utmost sincerity, it is an honor to shoot the shit with the owner of the club of all clubs.
STEVE=>Yeah, and we're proficient club hoppers -- so we know what we're talking about.
MR. ZADIR=>Thank you.
DOUG=>I mean, we usually go this place called 'The Palace' and that place is rank. The music is ancient.
STEVE=>Yeah, no celeb citings and the women are oinkers.
DOUG=>And they let any asswad in the door. It's the worst.
MR. ZADIR=>I own that place also.
DOUG=>Yeah, but it's a really good location.
STEVE=>And the drinks are reasonably priced.
MR. ZADIR=>No, no. You are right. That's what's wrong with this club business. One day you are hot next day you are not. People get bored easily.
DOUG=>Well, you know I had this great idea. You should make this place like a tropical jungle.
STEVE=>Yeah, lots of silk plants and vines.
DOUG=>Yeah, but they're not real vines. They're bungee cords and people could like swing from one end to the other so if you left your friends at the bar, you could get back to them.
STEVE=>Yeah, and the barmaids could wear loincloths -- but tasteful. Like the ones they wear in strip clubs.
MR. ZADIR=>You could not insure bungee cords. People jumping back and forth. Too expensive.
STEVE=>Okay. Hit delete on that one. Doug, tell him about your street idea.
DOUG=>I was just thinking, you know how people get bummed waiting outside to get in the club.
STEVE=>This is good. You're gonna love this.
DOUG=>Well, you make the outside of the club look like the inside. You know, you put down a rug outside and some couches and pipe out some music. People will love it. But, then on the inside.
STEVE=>Oh, this is the good part.
DOUG=>... Looks like the street. You know, you park some cars inside, a mailbox, street signs, and that way when they come in, it's like the outside is the inside and inside is the outside.
STEVE=>Doesn't that blow your mind?
MR. ZADIR=>It hurts my brain to think about it.
CAMBI=>What about that guy?
VIVICA=>He owns a restaurant.
CAMBI=>How many?
VIVICA=>One.
CAMBI=>Uch. How'd he get in?
VIVICA=>... Look, I don't see anything over six figures... So, let's just go.
CAMBI=>Wait a second. That's that Zadir guy.
CAMBI=>Too bad he's married. He owns all the clubs in town. Plus, dry cleaners, that beeper service, and Mailboxes, Etc...
VIVICA=>Who are those guys with him?
CAMBI=>I can't find them, but if they're with Zadir, they've got to be worth something.
VIVICA=>Great. Let's work.
GILBERT GOTTFRIED=>Oh my God! Benny! Benny! Benny! Benny!
MR. ZADIR=>Gilbert Gottfried, who let you in?
GILBERT GOTTFRIED=>You have to say hello to my friend at the other table. Not this table. No. No. The other one. Looks like this table -- other people around it. I have a friends and he needs you to say hello to him at the other table.
MR. ZADIR=>You have a friend?
GILBERT GOTTFRIED=>Oh my God! You got me! I didn't see it coming. No. It was coming but I was not able to see it.
MR. ZADIR=>I better go before he explodes.
DOUG=>Was I too pushy? I was too pushy. Did I speak well?
STEVE=>You were totally articulate.
DOUG=>Maybe he didn't like our ideas. It's hard to pitch in a night club. You ever notice, the music is blasting in here. We should try to get a meeting.
DOUG=>So, Steve, what if we...
STEVE=>Up what's? You want to dance?
VIVICA=>Yes.
DOUG=>Steve, she said 'Yes.'
STEVE=>What?
DOUG=>Hotties want to shake it, come on.
CAMBI=>Hey, guys! Over here.
STEVE=>Bro, you are incredible!
DOUG=>Seriously, unbelievable stuff out there. So, you want to hang out?
JOHN TRAVOLTA=>No.
STEVE=>Alright, catch you later then.
JOHN TRAVOLTA=>I don't think so.
VIVICA=>Wow, 1980, good year!
DOUG=>Oh, '80 was an excellent year. Devo had a big hit that year.
STEVE=>Yeah, and 'Joanie loves Chachie' started that year.
DOUG=>That was just a cheap spinoff.
STEVE=>That was a spinoff?
DOUG=>Of course, those characters originated on 'Happy Days.'
STEVE=>I did not know that.
CAMBI=>Sure, 'Joanie Loves Chachi.' But, does Chachi give a Fuck about Joanie?
MR. ZADIR=>Cambi makes a good point. But tonight we should have fun, not dwell on Scott Baio.
STEVE=>Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.
DOUG=>Dom Perignon's good but you know what really makes a party -- Redi Whip.
STEVE=>But not like when you put it on stuff. It's when you're half pressing on that little white nozzle and like before it comes out, you suck on it, and it's really fun.
CAMBI=>You mean like nitrous oxide? Whippets?
DOUG/STEVE=>... No!
DOUG=>Tscha! What is that?
MR. ZADIR=>Dooey! We must stop and get Redi Whip!
DOOEY=>Yes, sir.
STEVE=>But it has to be Redi Whip in a can!
MR. ZADIR=>Wait, he can't hear you.
STEVE=>I was just saying it has to be Redi Whip in a can.
DOOEY=>Right.
DOUG=>He really can't hear us?
MR. ZADIR=>No.
DOUG=>Dooey, tell your mother I had a really good time last night!
STEVE=>And your father!
DOUG=>What?
STEVE=>I mean your sister!
DOUG=>Good one.
DOOEY=>Mr. Zadir, I'm pulling over here to get whipped cream.
DOUG=>I'll be right back.
DOUG=>I'll take care of it.
DOUG=>Operator 238, please... What's up?
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Hello, Doug.
DOUG=>Guess where we went tonight?
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Let me see, the 7-11 on Ventura?
DOUG=>No, I mean, before this, you sly little credit vixen.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Doug!
DOUG=>The Roxbury with Richard Grieco and Bob Saget. You gotta come out sometime.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>I would. But then there'd be no one to approve all the money you spend.
DOUG=>You're always thinking of me.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>The card's good. 'Bye, Doug.
DOUG=>She approved.
STEVE=>Sweet ass cottage, Mr. Zadir.
DOUG=>Mr. Zadir, I am very impressed. For a guy who owns sleazy night clubs, the decor in your house is quite tasteful.
STEVE=>Good one.
CAMBI=>Excuse us, we're going to the ladies' room.
MR. ZADIR=>Anna Nicole! Put something on! You are making us sick!
DOUG=>Do you feel it, Steve? We are finally experiencing the party lifestyle to the fullest degree. Let's mingle.
DOUG=>How's it hanging? You want to mingle?
STEVE=>Cool party, huh?
MODEL GUY=>... I guess.
DOUG=>Yeah, I'd say it's kicking into gear right about...
STEVE=>... now.
DOUG=>So, what do you do?
MODEL GUY=>I'm a model.
DOUG=>Oh, right. So are we.
STEVE=>It's a hard job.
DOUG=>Yeah, you know, like you got to stand still all the time and uh...
STEVE=>... Standing still. Standing still is really hard. My foot cramps sometimes.
MODEL GUY=>I know what you mean. What agency you with? Elite, Ford?
STEVE=>Uh huh.
DOUG=>So, do you like mingling?
MODEL GUY=>Excuse me.
STEVE=>Nice guy.
DOUG=>See you on the shoot!
NAKED WOMAN=>Can you pass me a towel, please?
STEVE=>Good. How are you?
DOUG=>... about eight o'clock, eight fifteen.
NAKED WOMAN=>They're right behind you. Can you just reach over?
STEVE=>Thanks. All the time.
DOUG=>Sagittarius.
STEVE=>BMW.
DOUG=>Right off Sunset.
STEVE=>Vanilla mostly.
MR. ZADIR=>Look at this, I have the Spice Girls, yet nobody is dancing.
DOUG=>With all due party-throwing respect, you know what the problem is, Mr. Zadir? This pool is taking up all the prime dancing real estate.
STEVE=>Yeah, you know, if there were a big piece of glass you could put over the pool, you could use it as a dance floor. And it would be really sweet because people would feel like they were dancing on water.
DOUG=>And you could put fish in the water and it would be like the ocean.
STEVE=>Or, Doug, you know what would be another amazing idea? You could have a special room for people who want to dance naked.
DOUG=>Plus, then you could have a room next to that room with a one-way mirror so other people could watch them.
MR. ZADIR=>Boys, boys, please let's not talk business. We'll schedule a meeting for this.
CAMBI=>There you are.
VIVICA=>We got scared.
DOUG=>Of who? We'll kick his ass.
CAMBI=>No, we got scared someone stole you away from us.
DOUG=>Oh... Like some other girls would steal us away.
STEVE=>Oh, right... Oh!
CAMBI=>Mr. Zadir, would you mind if we borrowed them for a while?
MR. ZADIR=>Yes...
MR. ZADIR=>... No! Got you!
DOUG=>Good one, Mr. Zadir.
STEVE=>He totally got me.
DOUG=>Mr. Zadir, let me just say that you, sir, are a load and a half.
MR. ZADIR=>Thank you, Doug!
DOUG/STEVE=>... Oh, oh, here she comes...
STEVE=>Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up.
STEVE=>Whoa, here she comes...
DOUG/STEVE=>She's a maneater!
DOUG=>Guess who that was?
VIVICA=>I have no idea.
DOUG=>Well, I was supposed to have a moustache.
VIVICA=>Sonny and Cher?
STEVE=>Okay, we'll give you another hint.
STEVE=>She's a rich girl.
DOUG=>And she's going to go far 'cause she knows it doesn't matter anyway.
CAMBI=>Guys, guys! I have an idea. You want to have some fun?
DOUG=>Sure, fun is our last name.
STEVE=>Plus, fun spelled backwards is 'nuf.' And you can never have 'nuf' fun.
VIVICA=>Great. Let's go.
STEVE=>Where we going?
VIVICA=>They're staying in here. And we're going in there.
DOUG=>Steve!
STEVE=>Doug!
VIVICA=>Nice room.
STEVE=>Yeah, it's great. Doug, you should check out this room!
VIVICA=>I think he's busy.
STEVE=>I'm just a big believer in sharing.
VIVICA=>Steve, why don't you come over here?
VIVICA=>Steve!
STEVE=>Viv, you know what I heard when I first met you?
VIVICA=>What?
VIVICA=>What are you doing?
STEVE=>That's an ambulance. Coming to take me away because the sight of you just stopped my heart.
DOUG=>So, Cambi, can I ask you something? Do you like blueberries or strawberries?
MR. CAMBI=>Why?
DOUG=>I want to know what type of pancakes to order you in the morning.
DOUG=>You know, I was wondering... Steve!
STEVE=>... Sorry!
DOUG=>I was wondering...
CAMBI=>What are you doing?
DOUG=>Checking your label. Just as I thought. Made in heaven.
CAMBI=>Doug, you've gotten past the opening line.
DOUG=>Hey, is that a mirror in your pocket?
CAMBI=>What?
DOUG=>'Cause I can see myself in your pants.
CAMBI=>Hey, Doug, if I said you had a nice body, would you hold it against me?
DOUG=>What?
STEVE=>And this guy on the phone turns around and he tips his hat like this.
STEVE=>And who do you think the guy was?
DOUG=>And Steve was like 'Emilioooo!'
STEVE=>... Emilioooo!
DOUG=>Emilioooo! And it was really him.
CAMBI=>Is this your first time?
DOUG=>What? Oh my God. That is hilarious. That is so hilarious! Steve, did you hear that? You don't even know how funny that is. You are funny. You don't even know how funny you are! Man!
STEVE=>Vivica, I've been thinking. Our relationship is really going strong now. We've had some great times together that I'll never forget. Remember when I saw you at the pool?
VIVICA=>Yeah?
STEVE=>So, I was just remembering back. You know, an open dialogue is an essential element to any successful long term relationship. I think we have something special going on here and I don't want to move too fast.
VIVICA=>Is this your first time?
STEVE=>Yes. Isn't it yours?
STEVE=>Doug, oh my god!
DOUG=>Oh my God! Did you just? 'Cause I just!
STEVE=>This is unbelievable!
DOUG=>This is historical! This what it's all about! Up Top!
DOUG=>Not that it hasn't happened before.
STEVE=>Of course not.
DOUG=>I mean it was alright.
STEVE=>The usual.
STEVE=>I'm gonna go back in the --
DOUG=>Me, too. I'll see you later.
DOUG=>Hey, Steve?
STEVE=>Yeah, Doug.
DOUG=>That was great.
STEVE=>I know. Are we A club people now?
STEVE=>You got a number! Wooo!
DOUG/STEVE=>Woo! We got a number!
DOUG=>Where have you been? We've got to get ready for our business meeting with Mr. Zadir?
STEVE=>I got some great new supplies for our business.
STEVE=>'Post Its' to annotate important documents. 'Little Post Its' 'cause you write smaller than me. 'While you were out' pads -- for while you are out. Scotch tape, in case the Post Its lose their adhesive-osity. And mugs with our names on them. Yours says, 'Doug.'
DOUG=>Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
STEVE=>Did you call Mr. Zadir?
DOUG=>Steve, before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir, you have to have a fully developed plan of attack. You have to have all your ducks in row.
STEVE=>I didn't know to get ducks.
DOUG=>That's an expression.
STEVE=>So, we're going back to the dance club idea?
DOUG=>Yeah. Now you set up the office. I'm gonna call some real estate people to talk about locations. At that point, I'd like to schedule a meeting. Can you do tweleve thirty.
STEVE=>I'm clear.
DOUG=>Great. Be prepared to discuss possible club names and themes.
STEVE=>What about music?
DOUG=>We'll have to schedule another meeting for that. Hey, you know what? Maybe we should have a pre- meeting to brainstorm before our scheduled meeting.
STEVE=>Yeah. That way we won't look like idiots at our meeting.
DOUG=>Exactly. Okay, I'm gonna roll a few calls. We should order in.
STEVE=>I can take care of that. Ma!
DOUG=>Hey, Steve?
STEVE=>Yeah?
DOUG=>I was just thinking. Dad would really be proud of us right now.
MRS. BUTABI=>Boys, your father's furious. You were supposed to be at work an hour ago.
DOUG=>Alright, we're gonna have to do some re-scheduling.
DOUG=>Yes, hello, I'm interested in your sound systems. I've heard good things about your woofers and tweeters.
STEVE=>Doug, I...
DOUG=>I'm on a call.
LADY=>Mr. Butabi, where is the other cash register?
MR. BUTABI=>I'll be with you in a second, Mrs. Manicotti.
DOUG=>One second, Dad.
MR. BUTABI=>It's good to see you're on a break. I mean, after all, you've been here almost twenty minutes now and it's hard work listening to your walking man and ringing up the one customer you've had.
DOUG=>Dad, I'm sensing a note of sarcasm.
MR. BUTABI=>This is a very nice sign. Except for one thing. This is the only register! This is why I pay you -- to push a button and take the money. Is that too much? Is there some problem I don't know about? Did you injure your button pushing finger in a bad cell phone accident?
DOUG=>Dad, why don't you go to Rexall's Drug Store. I think you need to purchase a bottle of chill pills.
MR. BUTABI=>Just when I thought I had you doing the absolute minimum, you astound me with how much less you can do.
DOUG=>For your information, Dad, we are working our asses off.
STEVE=>Yeah, our week's filling up pretty quick.
DOUG=>Dad, last night, Steve and I happen to have made a very important business contact.
MR. BUTABI=>Oh, what are you dancing the Macarena with Donald Trump?
STEVE=>Did you want me to go the drug store to get those pills?
DOUG=>I think we should tell him now. Dad, you're gonna love this. We're working on this club idea which could include many silk plant opportunities and guess who we thought could be our supplier?
MR. BUTABI=>Yes, I need you to give me opportunities. I feed you, I clothe you, I put a roof over your head and I pay for your little phones so you can call other idiots. I give up on you two. I am ashamed to call you my sons.
DOUG=>There you go again, Dad. You always tell us to do something with our lives and when we finally do, what happens? You got to put us down. You never support us, you never encourage us, and you never care about what's important to us. Right, Steve?
STEVE=>Do you need a prescription for those pills?
MR. BUTABI=>It's my own fault. I spoil you. From now on, you are no longer allowed to go out to clubs at night.
DOUG/STEVE=>What?
MR. BUTABI=>Now enough wasting time. Go clean up the stock room.
DOUG=>You know what, Poppason, not only will Steve and I not clean the stock room, but we are officially out of here! Come on.
STEVE=>But what about the stock room?
DOUG=>We quit! And we don't need you! We made big contacts last night!
STEVE=>Yeah, plus we met these girls, Dad, and you wouldn't believe what happened.
DOUG=>We're gonna make it without you. You'll see.
MR. BUTABI=>Yes, I'll see tonight when you get hungry and you come home to eat my food. And when you come crawling to me for more money!
EMILY=>Hey, Steve! Do you want to go to the beach later? I've got my bathing suit on under this.
DOUG=>Not now!
EMILY=>I'm not talking to you, Doug. You're an ass.
STEVE=>Emily, we're experiencing a major family crisis. I'm gonna have to take a rain check on this convo.
DOUG=>Steve! Car!
STEVE=>Nice bulbs, Emily.
EMILY=>So, you want to go out tonight?
DOUG=>Okay, these are the ideas we'll pitch him. The Jungle Paradise.
STEVE=>Killer.
DOUG=>The Inside Out Club.
STEVE=>Money.
DOUG=>The Civil War.
STEVE=>That one needs work.
DOUG=>Yeah. We'll hold off on that one. And let's not forget our ace in the hole -- The Naked Room.
STEVE=>I think we should call it 'The Nudist Colony.'
DOUG=>That sounds like a strip club. And this is a dance club.
STEVE=>You're right. We'll go with 'The Naked Room.'
DOUG=>Zadir's gonna be excited to see us. This is it, bro...
STEVE=>This is it.
STEVE=>'This is it, make your mistakes where you are. This is it...'
STEVE/DOUG=>'... We're going no further.'
STEVE=>'Here! The moment is now, no place for goodbyes...'
INTERCOM=>'And now I'm not so sure... doo doo... deep in my heart...'
DOUG/STEVE/INTERCOM=>This is it!
INTERCOM=>You guys know 'Footloose'?
DOUG=>Actually, we're here to see Mr. Zadir. It's Steve and Doug Butabi.
STEVE=>'... pick up your Sunday shoes...'
INTERCOM=>Mr. Zadir's not here.
STEVE=>We were supposed to have a meeting with him about our ideas. Like there's one where the inside is outside and there's one about a jungle and...
DOUG=>Steve! Never talk concepts with the intercom. Can we come inside and wait for him?
INTERCOM=>No.
DOUG=>Can we leave him a message?
INTERCOM=>No.
STEVE=>Let's just forget it.
DOUG=>Stay strong, sailor. Do you know where we can find him?
INTERCOM=>He's at the office in Wilshire.
INTERCOM=>... 'Everybody cut, everybody cut... doo doo.'
DOUG=>Hey, Steve, did you notice we forgot to ask her something?
STEVE=>You mean, 'What's up?'
DOUG=>Yeah. That's weird.
STEVE=>Actually, it's not. We're both involved in serious relationships now, and our ladies know they can trust us. 'Trust' being the key element in any worthwhile commitment.
DOUG=>Why go out for burgers when we've got steak at home?
STEVE=>You're right. We should get lunch after this.
DOUG=>Doug and Steve Butabi for Mr. Zadir.
RECEPTIONIST=>You're brothers?
DOUG=>Ma'am, thanks for the setup, but we really can't get into that right now.
STEVE=>Doug, Mr. Zadir!
RECEPTIONIST=>Hey, you can't...!
STEVE=>Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm in a serious relationship right now.
DOUG/STEVE=>Dooey! My very main man. Up top!
STEVE=>So, Dooey, how's everything goin'?
DOUG=>Ragin' party last night.
DOOEY=>Yeah, is that what my mother said to you... ... or was it my father?
DOUG=>So, Zadir wants to have this meeting by the elevators?
DOOEY=>Those Redi Whip cans were a big hit last night. I was out till four in the morning trying to find more.
STEVE=>From dusk 'til dawn -- you, sir, are a party animal.
DOOEY=>Don't go near Mr. Zadir. He was drunk last night and he doesn't even remember you. You think you're the first losers he's picked up that I've had to get rid of come Monday?
DOUG=>Uh... Doo-man, I don't know if I'm reading my diss-meter correctly. Because are we being blown off.
DOOEY=>Just stay away if you know what's good for you.
STEVE=>Alright, so we'll see you guys later.
STEVE=>What do you want to do?
DOUG=>I can't talk to you right now. Give me a second.
STEVE=>Maybe we should just go back to work.
DOUG=>Yeah, and maybe we should just go to college and not put gel in our hair and starts wearing blue jeans. Let's do that, Steve!
STEVE=>... Sorry.
STEVE=>Cambi's number.
STEVE=>We had a sweet time last night, didn't we?
DOUG=>Sweet ass time.
STEVE=>Diabetic. I could see doing that again, maybe even a couple a times a week, right?
DOUG=>The ladies await, my friend. Cell!
VIVICA=>Yeah, I think it's great how you get to travel around the world.
AKIRO=>These hotties are sweet.
TORONAGA=>Sweet ass.
VIVICA=>Who is it?
CAMBI=>I don't know. It's just a bunch of pound signs.
STEVE=>I'm not sure you're doing it right.
DOUG=>Steve, you have to hit the pound sign or it doesn't go through. Maybe their phones aren't working.
STEVE=>Try putting in our number and then hitting pound.
DOUG=>Excuse me, Mr. Bill Nye the Science Guy.
CAMBI=>Hello?
DOUG=>Cambi. It's your boyfriend. I need to see you.
CAMBI=>Uh... well, I'm at the Skybar.
DOUG=>Be right there... sweetheart.
DOUG=>How's my hair?
STEVE=>Good.
DOUG=>Long-term relationship good?
STEVE=>It's totally committed. You know, Doug, when things aren't going so well, it really makes you realize how much your woman means to you.
DOUG=>These guys bothering you?
CAMBI=>Hi, Doug.
DOUG=>You guys messing with our women.
JAPANESE GUYS=>What's up?
DOUG=>You want to mix it up? Come on! Take me on. I'm insane. You don't know what you're dealing with.
STEVE=>Vivica, I'm feeling a little vulnerable here. I thought we had an understanding. And I can't believe you're willing to just throw away everything we've been to each other?
VIVICA=>Doug, Steve, this is Akiro and Toronaga... they're my cousins.
STEVE=>Oh! Well, it's about time that we met the family.
DOUG=>Come on! What do you think, we're stupid? How can they be your cousins?
VIVICA=>Well, his mother and my mother are sisters and that makes us cousins.
DOUG=>... Oh. Okay.
CAMBI=>Would you excuse us a second?
DOUG=>Yeah, we just got to talk to them a second.
STEVE=>Yeah, 'cause we slept with them last night so...
CAMBI=>So, did you guys have as good a time last night as we did?
STEVE=>I had a great time, Vivica. In fact, I think we've reached the point where I can comfortably call you 'Viv' and leave out the 'Ica.'
DOUG=>So, you guys want to hang out or see a movie or do what we did last night... or eat or... just do what we did last night or hang out, eat and then do what we did last night or... you know, whatever... and do what we did last night.
VIVICA=>Sounds good.
STEVE=>Viv, I'm glad our relationship is strong enough to withstand the hard times -- like when were just in the bar -- I also think we're not just projecting onto one another but dealing with the reality of who we are. And most important, we know how to listen.
VIVICA=>What?
CAMBI=>Hey, you boys want to go somewhere quiet?
DOUG=>No...
DOUG/STEVE=>Yes!
STEVE=>It's gold. I'm telling you.
DOUG=>Ladies, have your boarding passes ready.
CAMBI=>What are you doing?
STEVE=>Aisle or window seat? I'm sorry, ma'am, you're gonna have to check that bag... The movie on this flight will be uh... I don't know. I can't think of any more.
VIVICA=>Where's your car?
DOUG=>Our dad got mad and took it away.
CAMBI=>Your dad?
STEVE=>Yeah, we used to work for him, but we quit today so actually we're unemployed.
VIVICA=>You're not in business with Mr. Zadir?
DOUG=>Yes, we are. But, not now. We just met him last night. But, we will be. So, no, but, yes.
STEVE=>Especially, if we ever get to see him again.
STEVE=>Hey, we were just kidding about those boarding passes. You can get in.
CAMBI=>Get away from us.
DOUG=>What's going on?
CAMBI=>You guys are a big waste of time.
DOUG=>... Como what?
VIVICA=>Steve, you're a jerkoff.
STEVE=>Well, I'm glad you shared that with me. That's a big step for the both of us.
CAMBI=>Guys, consider what we did with you last night a favor. Now do us a favor and never talk to us again!
DOUG=>What did we do wrong? We'll change.
VIVICA=>No, you can't change. You and your brother are ugly pathetic losers. That's the problem with nightclubs. Poor schmucks look just the same as rich schmucks.
CAMBI=>I can't believe we actually had sex with those asswads. I hope the nips are still at the bar.
STEVE=>Hey, Doug, I think some of the plants are beginning to wilt... no, I'm just kidding. They're made out of silk.
STEVE=>... 'This is it.'
DOUG=>Steve! This is the worst day of my life. So, if you don't mind, I really don't want to hear you talk right now.
STEVE=>Well, it hasn't been the Super Bowl for me either... ... just trying to get you to talk.
DOUG=>Talk?! You want me to talk, Steve?! I'll talk. Blah-blah-blah, talk, talk, talk! I'm talking! You feel better now?! Talk!
STEVE=>I don't really know how to respond to that.
DOUG=>Oh, big surprise, Steve. You don't know how to do something. You don't know how to work the clubs, you don't know how to talk to women. The only thing you know how to do is ask me how to do everything!
STEVE=>But, I --
DOUG=>That's why everthing's gone wrong... 'cause you're holding me back.
DOUG=>You're so needy all the time. You're like this thing tied to my leg, like this... dragging thing...
STEVE=>A lead weight?
DOUG=>Yes, a lead weight. Thanks. And I am not letting you drag me down anymore.
STEVE=>... You know, can't blame me for what happened. Today was a series of random events gone awry.
DOUG=>Maybe events wouldn't go awry if I had someone with a brain sitting next to me.
STEVE=>Oh, yeah. Well, maybe I'd have better events if I was with someone with a higher level of looks and taller.
DOUG=>I'm tall enough to kick your ass.
STEVE=>Did you say something? It's hard to hear things that low down to the ground.
DOUG=>Well hear this. Consider me your ex-brother.
STEVE=>I don't care.
DOUG=>You care about this?
DOUG=>You want the real thing?!
STEVE=>No.
DOUG=>Then stop talking to me.
STEVE=>My pleasure.
DOUG=>Lies! All lies!
STEVE=>That's right, ma'am. It's silk. It'll always be in bloom. It'll never change. It'll never die. It'll never yell at you and call you a 'loser.' It'll always be in your room where you left it, not suddenly move out into the guest house.
MR. BUTABI=>What are you doing? All the customers are depressed.
STEVE=>I'm just used to seeing Doug at the register. I miss him.
MR. BUTABI=>But he's only in the guest house. It's ten feet away. It's like a mansion in there.
STEVE=>There's no cable.
MR. BUTABI=>There is Cinemax.
STEVE=>But, there's no H.B.O.
EMILY=>Nine... ten.
EMILY=>Okay. One more set. Add ten pounds.
EMILY=>Whoops. Sorry. Wrong pin.
CRAIG=>Not the neck -- the stomach. Not the thighs -- the stomach. Not the shoulders - the... Oh my God!
STEVE=>What?
CRAIG=>Ab citing! Six pack in full effect.
STEVE=>Where!
CRAIG=>There she cuts.
EMILY=>Hi, Steve. Is that an ab?
CRAIG=>Toned and tight, Emily. Want to power up?
EMILY=>I heard about your brother.
STEVE=>What'd you hear about him?
EMILY=>Your father said you and him quit, then you had a fight, then you came crawling back to work like he said you would and how your brother didn't.
STEVE=>So?
EMILY=>So, when are we going out?
CRAIG=>I know a place with good spinach wraps?
STEVE=>Look, Emily, I know you've had your heart set on this a long time, but, the truth is we're from two different worlds. I mean, I'm a rebel... and you're kind of the sweet girl next door type.
EMILY=>Steve, I work next door. It's not a type, it's a location.
STEVE=>You know what I mean. I don't know if you can handle a guy like me. I'm used to more, like experienced women.
EMILY=>Duh. You're forgetting -- I got to college. Translation -- drunken orgies with occasional Cliff Notes.
CRAIG=>I know Cliff. Weak delts.
EMILY=>And I'm not one of those date rape crybabies.
STEVE=>Look, it sounds good, but I'm getting over a very serious relationship right now. It's gonna take some time to nurse my emotional wounds. And that could take, like, until Saturday.
EMILY=>Perfect, your dad bought us two tickets to David Copperfield, this Saturday.
STEVE=>I'll let you know how I'm feeling.
EMILY=>It'll be fun to see things appear, and then disappear.
EMILY=>See ya.
CRAIG=>Tight glutes. Steve, as a trainer. I'm pretty perceptive about picking up body language... I think she likes you.
DOUG=>... Fine! I won't watch Larry Sanders!
EMILY=>Here's one -- 'Business Computer Systems.'
STEVE=>I'm not real good with machines. That was Doug's thing. I'm more of a people person.
EMILY=>Steve, a businessman has to have a knowledge of computers. Ooo! -- 'Venture Management and Analysis.' you have to take that.
STEVE=>You know, my dad's giving me the store anyway. I don't really have to go back to school.
EMILY=>One store? Yah... and maybe we'll just have like one house and one car. Steve, we're gonna have more than one store. And you have to be prepared.
STEVE=>I don't really want to go back to school. I'll have to read.
STEVE=>And homework and teachers always asking you if you'd like to share that with the rest of the class.
EMILY=>Don't upset me. Unless you want to make me less horny.
STEVE=>No, that wouldn't be good.
EMILY=>Look, first, we combine the stores, plants and lamps, then we can add furniture, you know recliners...
EMILY=>... sofas and tables and... and...
STEVE=>... chairs?
EMILY=>Oh, yes! Chairs and wastepaper baskets and... and...
STEVE=>Ah!... Ottomans!
EMILY=>And then we'll open a second store in Orange County with dinette sets and entertainment centers, and a third in San Francisco and then we'll be bigger than Ikea, oh my God... Home Depot! I, I, Ikeaaa!
STEVE=>Emily, I'm sort of feeling, you know, like we're moving too fast. You're talking like we're married.
EMILY=>Oh my God! Steve! You've made me so happy!
STEVE=>What? No, no. I meant...
STEVE=>... Oookay.
CRAIG=>Doug, If I'm not mistaken, this place has got it going on. I owe you big time for inviting me.
CRAIG=>Wooooo! Who wants to dance all night long! And I mean aaall night! Wooo! Doug, I am having a hell of a time!
DOUG=>Whatever, Craig.
CRAIG=>Hey, do you think I should wear this outfit to your brother's wedding?
DOUG=>What?
CRAIG=>Your brother's wedding? What are you gonna wear?
DOUG=>Oh, God.
CRAIG=>You got to hand it to Steve. That Emily's the perfect woman. Strong legs, low body fat, and a positive mental attitude. A lady like that can really keep you on track. Is it okay to wear black at an afternoon affair?
DOUG=>Shut up, you idiot.
CRAIG=>Doug, I know you and your brother are having some problems, but that is no reason to refer to my intellectual capacity in a diminutive manner.
DOUG=>I'm sorry, Craig, but you totally Wolf Blitzerd me with the matrimony update. Do you mind if we just don't talk about my brother?
CRAIG=>Ten-Four. Boundary set.
DOUG=>Look, did we come here for some Starbucks' latte chitchat or did we come here to hit on hotties?
CRAIG=>Hotties.
DOUG=>Let's do it.
DOUG=>Hey, sweetness, what's up?
DOUG=>Hey, fine thing, you got it going on.
ELLEN DEGENERES=>Thank you. I was worried.
DOUG=>So, you want to shake it?
ELLEN DEGENERES=>No, I think I'll just let it sit.
DOUG=>You sure?
ELLEN DEGENERES=>Now that I've met you, I'm more sure than I've ever been.
CRAIG=>That was a... ... close encounter.
DOUG=>She'll be back. Just playing hard to get.
CRAIG=>I am having a hell of a time! Wooo!
MRS. BUTABI=>And the hors d'oeuvers are hummus dip and babaganoush...
MABEL=>Who's going to eat that? You should have pigs in the blanket and chicken fingers.
MR. BUTABI=>Okay. A toast to Steve and Emily, who after tommorow will be Mr. and Mrs. Steve Butabi.
EMILY=>Emily Anderson-Butabi.
MR. BUTABI=>Really. Okay. Well... to whoever they turn out to be.
FRED=>I would also like to thank everyone for flying in to join us. My brother and his wife from Chicago. My parents who came in all the way from Maine despite Mom's sciatica. And the Butabis who came all the way in from Yee- men.
MR. BUTABI=>Yemen.
FRED=>Wherever the hell that is. I'm just kidding. And that's not the only union I'm excited about. From what I understand, we got a new lamp/plant store.
MR. BUTABI=>That's plant/lamp store. Ha ha... that's a joke. But, seriously, I think it sounds better.
EMILY=>Steve, don't you want to make a toast?
STEVE=>No, that's alright.
EMILY=>All the men are doing it?
STEVE=>So, okay, uh... I just want to say... what's up... Grandpa, Grandma, and those other two old people.
EMILY=>I think what Steve means, is that, we're just thrilled with the way this family is coming together. And I'd like to share with you some of our business plans for after the merger. Can you pass these out?
MR. BUTABI=>I will get more wine.
STEVE=>Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could cancel this whole thing?
MR. BUTABI=>Yes, sure... ... Nooo!
STEVE=>Dad, that's so funny. But I really don't want to get married.
MR. BUTABI=>You are serious? All these people are here and you are serious?
STEVE=>Dad, it's like, Emily had turned into this whole different person. I mean, at first, she was this girl that I really liked to have sex with. Then she turned into this other girl who I really don't want to marry -- although I don't mind having sex with her.
MR. BUTABI=>Look, the catering is paid for. The tents are all set up. Your grandparents flew half way around the world. Besides, all men go through the same thing the night before their wedding.
STEVE=>You mean, all guys feel sort of nervous and anxious, and kind of hope a train hits her and she eats a can of botulism or maybe she could hang out with a deer, and a hunter accidently shoots her or you know, when she's sleeping and she makes that nose whistle sound and you shake her to make it quiet but what you'd really like to do is take her stupid red toothbrush and ram it up her nostril into her skull.
MR. BUTABI=>Steve, these feelings are perfectly normal.
STEVE=>Doug? Doug? You there?
DOUG=>You've reached Doug Butabi. I'm not home right now -- because I'm...
DOUG=>... out living it up, unlike my pussywhipped brother who's busy throwing his life away and will spend the rest of his years selling silk plants for Emillyyy... ... Beeeep.
STEVE=>Doug, sorry I missed you. I guess you heard I'm gettng married tommorow. I was just wondering if you wanted to be my best man. See ya.
STEVE=>Craig, I know you can lift it. Now can you just listen to me?
CRAIG=>I got it. I walk down the aisle. I stand next to you. And I settle any inter-wedding party skirmishes.
STEVE=>No, you're the best man. Not the wedding bouncer. You just gotta back me up.
CRAIG=>Oh, you mean like spotting you?
STEVE=>Exactly.
CRAIG=>Now, I get it. If things get too heavy, I step in. Like a relationship spotter. Thank you, man. I won't let you down.
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Okay, boys, we're about ready to start. You look very nice, Steven.
STEVE=>Thank you, Father. I love what you're wearing also.
STEVE=>You know, Dad, I've been thinking. I didn't really have time to have a bachelor party and that's a pretty important part of the marriage experience. So, we may want to consider delaying the wedding a couple of hours so we can go to a strip club or something.
MR. BUTABI=>Sh! We're starting.
BRIDESMAID=>Richard Grieco? How do you know Steve?
RICHARD GRIECO=>Look, I just don't want to be sued.
CRAIG=>Alright... it's a long walk... pace yourself.
CRAIG=>Grandma, you look unbelievable! Woo!
STEVE=>What's up? You from out of town?
STEVE=>See you at the reception.
CRAIG=>Steve! Getting married! Go for it! You are the man!
EMILY=>Shut up, Craig! I'm walking down the aisle, you dick!
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today, to join together...
STEVE=>Father? Did we already start?
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Yes.
STEVE=>Oh. Sorry I thought there was going to be a buzzer or whistle or something.
FATHER WILLIAMS=>... To join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show any just cause why these two should not be lawfully joined together, speak now or forever hold his peace.
CRAIG=>I am having a hell of a time!
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Very good. Now I understand the bride and groom have each prepared something.
EMILY=>Dear Steve, today I wear this wedding gown, and on my face there is no frown. I know our lives together will be great, just like when we saw David Copperfield on our first date. If you set something free and it comes back, you should love it forever, and like one of your silk plants, I'll try to stay beautiful, that is my endeavor. Love, forever, Emily.
STEVE=>Emily, I used to see you outside my father's store. And then we went out on some dates and you let me have sex with you.
STEVE=>I'm done.
FATHER=>Very nice. Steven, do you promise to love Emily, comfort her, honor her, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?
STEVE=>My father already paid the caterer.
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Emily, do you promise to comfort Steve, and honor him in sickness and health, as long as you both shall live?
EMILY=>I do.
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Now, Steven, repeat after me...
STEVE=>'After me'... just kidding. I'm nervous.
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Now repeat after me, with this ring I thee wed...
STEVE=>With this ring, I thee wed.
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Now, Emily, repeat after me. With this ring, I thee wed.
EMILY=>With This ring --
STEVE=>Doug.
MR. BUTABI=>Let's just keep it going.
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Mr. Butabi, I can't --
MR. BUTABI=>Just ignore him.
FATHER WILLIAMS=>Say 'With this ring I thee...'
EMILY=>With this ring --
STEVE=>Sorry, Dad. Emily, I'm sorry. I'm not ready yet. I liked your poem.
CRAIG=>I'm sorry, Mr. Butabi, but as best man, my primary duty is to allow the groom to beat a hasty retreat should the occasion take a sudden ugly turn.
CRAIG=>Don't test me.
STEVE=>Hey.
DOUG=>Hello.
RICHARD GRIECO=>Mr. Butabi, as an actor, I'm a keen observer of human nature. And, I can tell that neither of your sons are anywhere near the maturity level necessary for this sort of commitment.
CRAIG=>Go ahead, Father.
EMILY=>What are you doing?
CRAIG=>Emily, with all due respect to Steve, his discipline is lacking as is his appreciation for you. I, on the other hand, can bench press 305 lbs. I squat a clean 525, and my body fat percentage is less than two percent. Not only am I a professional trainer, but I someday hope to market my own protein bars and produce an Iron Buns video.
EMILY=>... Okay... We should look into infomercials.
DOUG=>... and I also took Craig out clubbing.
STEVE=>Mm-hm.
DOUG=>That was alright. Plus, I rented a lot of videos and I didn't do much else.
STEVE=>Uh-huh.
DOUG=>Look, I, uh, I don't know... I just... Steve?
DOUG=>Look, I'm sorry. I said a lot of bad things before and... lately... I don't know.
DOUG=>I've been thinking, you know... You're my brother... we're brothers and when we're together, you know... You just...
DOUG=>You don't drag me down, Steve... I drag me down, me! And you... you complete me!
STEVE=>Shut up. Just shut up! You had me at hello.
RICHARD GRIECO=>And it seems to me that you're a little bit harder on Doug than you are on Steve. Isn't that true?
MR. BUTABI=>You are right. It's just that Doug is so rebellious, so hard to control.
RICHARD GRIECO=>Rebellious? Scrappy? Dreamer, maybe? What other young man does that remind you of?
MR. BUTABI=>... Myself.
RICHARD GRIECO=>So who are you really fighting with?
MR. BUTABI=>Oh, Richard Grieco, you see right through me.
DOUG=>I missed this car. I look good in it.
STEVE=>Of course you do, bro.
DOUG=>You know it... Oh... And... you know, you look good also.
STEVE=>Thanks, bro. I'm glad you moved back in the room.
DOUG=>Dad was kind of a sport about the wedding once Richard Grieco talked to him.
STEVE=>Yeah, and isn't it a kick in the head how Emily hooked up with Craig.
DOUG=>It's funny. The infomercial really makes you want to buy those Power Bars.
STEVE=>That silhouette chick is hot.
DOUG=>Hey, look...
DOUG=>We got to remember to tape them.
GILBERT GOTTFRIED=>Yes! Yes, we're in flight! Yes! No! No, that's down. We don't want from down. We want up! Yes! Up is good!
STEVE=>Hey, I wonder whatever happened to Vivica's cousins?
AKIRO=>Kiyamo tomaga.
TORONAGA=>Kayama, Tokayama! Ko ma sayagan a suma.
DOUG=>Hey, get in the other lane, there's an accident.
STEVE=>Wow, I can't believe all that stuff got wrapped up in one day.
DOUG=>Hey, check it out...
STEVE=>Wait a second, that was your idea.
DOUG=>It was killer. Bound to happen.
BOUNCER=>Whoa! No one gets in unless they talk to the list.
DOUG=>Right. Well we're on the list.
STEVE=>Steve and Doug Butabi.
BOUNCER=>Butabi... Great. Step right in.
DOUG=>I'm sorry?
BOUNCER=>Go right in.
STEVE=>... Okaaay.
DOUG=>I guess we should go in then.
STEVE=>Yeah.
MR. ZADIR=>Boys!
STEVE/DOUG=>Mr. Zadir!
MR. ZADIR=>How do you lke our place?
DOUG=>Our place?
MR. ZADIR=>Yes, I cut you in. It was your idea.
STEVE=>Sweet.
DOUG=>Sweet ass sweet.
MR. ZADIR=>It's not all sweet asses. Running a club is a lot of hard work.
BOUNCER=>Mr. Zadir, we've got a situation at the door.
DOUG=>We'll take care of it, Mr. Zadir.
STEVE=>We're on the job.
CAMBI=>Call the manager then! We're always on the list!
DOUG=>Excuse me, I'm the owner. Is there a problem here?
CAMBI=>Hi, uh...
DOUG=>Doug.
STEVE=>Steve, or jerkoff as you like to put it.
VIVICA=>Look, you're not gonna hold that against is. Just let us in.
DOUG=>Good job. Don't let these or any other predatory lowlife strumpets in the club.
STEVE=>Good call.
DOUG=>Only 'cause it's true.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>That voice sounds so familiar...
DOUG=>Hey, is that...?
DOUG=>Are you...?
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Doug?
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>I can't believe it.
DOUG=>You're even more beautiful than you sound.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>You stopped calling?
DOUG=>Not because I didn't want to... Am I what you expected?
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>I totally approve.
STEVE=>Hey, Doug. Do you have the time?
DOUG=>Eleven thirty.
STEVE=>No, do you have the...
DOUG=>Steve, I think it's working out, but thanks for your help... Come on into my club.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Well, I've got my friend.
STEVE=>Hottie police officer?
POLICE OFFICER=>Violater of posted speed limits?
STEVE=>I was really looking forward to meeting you at the municipal court on or before June sixth.
POLICE OFFICER=>Oh, I love this song.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR=>Me, too.
STEVE=>In all honesty, I'm a little sick of it.
DOUG=>Good one. Where do you come up with this stuff?
STEVE=>I don't know. Every once in a while I strike pay dirt. Let's shake it.
DOUG=>Whoa, whoa. Name please?
CLUB GOER=>Neil Platt.
DOUG=>Let me check the list.
DOUG=>I don't see it.
STEVE=>So, step right in.
STEVE=>Name please.
GIRL=>Lisa Horowitz.
STEVE=>Nope. You can go in.
EMILIO ESTEVEZ=>Estevez.
STEVE=>Oh my God!
DOUG/STEVE=>Emillliooooo!
