ADAM=>Well, well, you're a big fella...!
ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND ARE ON VACATION!=>HOORAY!
BARBARA=>I'm ready!
ADAM=>She's ready.
BARBARA=>It looks great.
ADAM=>Thanks.
BARBARA=>Happy vacation, honey!
ADAM=>Manchurian Tung oil? Where did you get it?
BARBARA=>Helen got it for me in Oslo. There's enough to refinish the gateleg table and the cherry wardrobe...
BARBARA=>Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.
ADAM=>Enough to do the guest room...
BARBARA=>I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home... ... I'm going to get started right now!
ADAM=>Whoa!... hold on...
BARBARA=>Oh no.
ADAM=>It's your turn, darling.
JANE=>Hi, Barb! I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
BARBARA=>That's right, Jane. Complete vacation.
JANE=>Honey -- today I am three hundred fifty thousand dollars!
BARBARA=>No! Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
JANE=>Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real! From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph! My buyer has just made a killing in condos in Manhattan, but he's got a little stress problem... ... so -- he wants to bring the wife and kid for the old peace and quiet.
BARBARA=>That's what we're looking for, too.
JANE=>Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just listen now. This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
JANE=>Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything... it's just too big for you.
BARBARA=>'Bye, Jane, see you in a few weeks.
BARBARA=>Oh, honey. You said no Inkspots on this vacation!
JANE=>Boo!
ADAM=>No, Jane.
ADAM=>Honey, come with me down to the store?
BARBARA=>What for?
ADAM=>I need a good brush for this Tung oil and I want to pick up a piece of the model. Let's go early before anyone sees us.
BARBARA=>Okay, but let's hurry back. You just run in okay?
BARBARA=>Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
ADAM=>Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.
ADAM=>We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
BARBARA=>I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
ADAM=>Let's not think about it. We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation. Here comes the bridge chorus.
TOGETHER=>Chances are... When I wear a foolish grin...
BARBARA=>Wave at the lion.
ADAM=>Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
BARBARA=>Adam!
JANE BUTTERFIELD ANTIQUES REAL ESTATE=>TRAVEL
JANE=>Y... ello. Mrs. Deetz? Well the condition is what we country folk call, fixin'... Yes, I think they are fixin' to accept another offer. Well maybe if you offer 390,000 they'll take it.
OLD BILL=>'Morning, Adam. You need a haircut before your vacation?
ADAM=>No thanks, Bill.
OLD BILL=>How's the model coming?
ADAM=>Good, Bill -- Good.
OLD BILL=>Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said Bozman built the foundation in 1835 but y'know his grandson came in here last week and said he found a bottle with an 1836 stamp in it plastered in the foundation. He's got hair down to his goddamned shoulders...
OLD BILL=>He said "Just give me a trim..." I took a scissors to him so fast... would've skimmed him clean if he hadn't...
ADAM=>See you, Bill.
OLD BILL=>Right.
BARBARA=>It's a beauty.
ADAM=>Yeah it turned out okay. We applied for a historical plaque for it. That'll be the third one on Main Street.
BARBARA=>With all these historical landmarks in town, where are they going to put the condominiums?
ADAM=>Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
BARBARA=>Oh... I'm sorry...
BARBARA=>Something like this always happens when we try to go on vacation. Always.
ADAM=>You'll feel better when you're dry.
BARBARA=>This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
ADAM=>How's your arm?
BARBARA=>I'm not sure. It feels... frozen.
BARBARA=>Oh, Adam.
ADAM=>You'd better sit down, hon.
BARBARA=>I am sitting.
ADAM=>I'll tell you what, Barbara. I don't think we survived that crash.
BARBARA=>Oh, Adam. We're home. In our own house. Nonsense. I'll make some coffee. You get some more firewood.
ADAM=>Let's take things extra slow. Do you remember how we got back up here?
BARBARA=>I'm fine. My arm works fine.
BARBARA=>The end of a perfect day.
ADAM=>Honey, I'm gonna go down to the bridge and retrace our steps.
BARBARA=>Adam!
ADAM=>Barbara?
ADAM=>Where are you?
ADAM=>You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever...
BARBARA=>Two hours.
ADAM=>What?
BARBARA=>That's how long you were gone.
ADAM=>... Hmmm?
ADAM=>Anything happen while I was away?
BARBARA=>Yes, it did. Yes, it did. I made a couple of small discoveries.
BARBARA=>There's that, and there's this.
ADAM=>Handbook for the recently diseased.
BARBARA=>Deceased. I don't know where it came from. Look at the publisher.
ADAM=>Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
BARBARA=>I don't think we survived the crash.
BARBARA=>I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
ADAM=>This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
BARBARA=>There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to last?
ADAM=>I don't see anything about "Rewards and Punishments" or "Heaven and Hell." This book reads like stereo instructions! Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation." This is going to take some time.
BARBARA=>I knew I'd never finish the guest room. Adam, we just can't stay in here forever!
ADAM=>Maybe we should set up a normal routine.
ADAM=>I mean, let's try to nail down something in our lives. A regular schedule. We can keep track of time and go on with our projects up here in the attic.
BARBARA=>Oh, God, maybe this is all just a bad dream.
ADAM=>I'm afraid not, honey.
BARBARA=>Why? What's wrong? Adam?
ADAM=>I wish I had a better view of the cemetery from up here. I don't know which area is the best placement for us.
ADAM=>Cabin fever, han?
BARBARA=>I can't clean anything. The vacuum is out in the garage. I can't leave the house. Why don't they tell us something? Where are all the other dead people in the world? Why is it just you and me?
ADAM=>Maybe this is heaven.
BARBARA=>In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
ADAM=>Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me. Look, we never have to wash dishes again.
BARBARA=>Dishes? We haven't eaten in three weeks! Adam, I'm not like you. I really need to be around people, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
ADAM=>But I'm not hungry, are you?
BARBARA=>I keep having this feeling that something has got to happen.
ADAM=>God, it's Jane.
BARBARA=>What's she doing here?
ADAM=>I don't know. Jane, Jane, up here!
BARBARA=>She can't see you, right?
BARBARA=>In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
ADAM=>Won't? Or can't?
BARBARA=>Just says "won't." Wait a minute. Here it says "the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead."
ADAM=>Arrogant. That's Jane all right...
BARBARA=>At least we won't have to worry about her.
DELIA=>Don't worry. It was going anyway.
DELIA=>Jesus. Who lived here? The Waltons?
DELIA=>Get all this other crap out of here.
DELIA=>Where is your father?... probably in the kitchen.
CHARLES=>The noise in that kitchen. Noisy refrigerator, noisy faucets... We'll have to replace it all. I want no humming in the house.
CHARLES=>What do you think, honey?
LYDIA=>Delia hates it.
LYDIA=>I could live here.
DELIA=>Settle down, Lydia. I wonder where we are going to get counseling for you out here.
