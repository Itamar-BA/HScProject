ROSE=>No, you don't.
TOM=>Probably not.
NEIL=>Hey- man, what's up?
ROSE=>What was that?
ROSE=>Unfortunately.
HANNAH=>What's she like?
HANNAH=>No... not really.
NEIL=>What's up, man?
JACOB=>Hello RoseMarie.
HANNAH=>That is so funny.
JACOB=>Where's it from?
ROSE=>--She was fat.
JACOB=>... without even trying.
NEIL=>Oh, hey Hannah.
HANNAH=>I don't think so.
TOM=>Eight-thirty.
TOM=>I feel awful.
JACOB=>Fuck this shit.
JACOB=>A ten foot pole?
ROSE=>Well, go ahead.
ROSE=>Yeah, show me.
ROSE=>Let her finish.
ROSE=>No, you're not.
ELIZABETH=>I'm not complaining.
ELIZABETH=>Don't you ever get lonely, peddling, night after night?
HANNAH=>Good night, Tom.
TOM=>I'm not sure.
NEIL=>Thanks Hannah.
TOM=>What happened?
JACOB=>You ready to go?
NEIL=>What happened?
TOM=>Where are they?
ROSE=>Yeah, I'll say.
NEIL=>Hannah, please.
TOM=>I don't know.
TOM=>I don't know.
TOM=>I'm not upset.
