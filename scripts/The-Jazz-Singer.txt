MED. SHOT BOTH=>Jack laughs as he says of course it's for her. She shakes her head at this unheard of extravagance. She tells him he shouldn't have spent so much money for her. Jack laughs heartily.
CLOSE-UP JACK=>He tells her that it's nothing at all, adding:

CLOSE-UP YUDELSON=>He says, still glaring at Levy and desiring to rub it in:
CLOSE SHOT GROUP=>They all start arguing, and Yudelson takes out his watch and tells the committee that the meeting is over.

MED. SHOT JACK=>As he comes to the closing notes of the song, the figure of the old cantor in his synagogue robes appears on the side of the screen very faint and shadowy. The misty form slowly comes to the side of the singer. It pauses. There is a smile on the face of the old cantor as
