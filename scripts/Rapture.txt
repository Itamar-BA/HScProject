INTERIOR: VIC'S STORE. NIGHT.=>VIC leads the others in, turning on lights and slow dance music . We move through the store to a far corner, to a model bedroom.
INTERIOR: VIC'S STORE. NIGHT.=>SHARON, RANDY, and DIANA on a bed. Their sex is a ritual, and the surprise here is their need. SHARON is the subject. They finish. They are still for a moment. SHARON gets up. We watch RANDY watching her.

VIC=>That goofy smile.
SHARON=>Why would I do that?
INTERIOR: CHURCH. DAY.=>A small, spare room. No pews, only a circle of folding chairs. Perhaps twenty people are there. We're watching HENRY and his son, THE BOY, about ten years old. He never speaks out loud; he whispers behind a cupped hand into his father's ear.
INTERIOR: CHURCH. NIGHT.=>There are more people in the room now. THE BOY is older now; and although HENRY is beside him, he speaks directly.
EXTERIOR: SWIMMING POOL. DAY.=>We move through the water, and the change from the light is easy, gradual. The water is ethereal; we don't even know this is a pool yet; it could be a body of heavenly water. The calm surface of the pool explodes as a six-year-old- girl, MARY, bursts to the surface. SHARON moves through the water. Her friend PAULA floats on a raft.

INTERIOR: RANDY'S WORKPLACE. DAY.=>We hear a blast. We see RANDY in his office at the corner of a hall. There are two bodies in the hall, and LOUIS walks down it with a gun. RANDY gets up from his desk and starts to come out. As he does, LOUIS shoots into an office. LOUIS goes into another office, and we hear two more shotgun blasts.

EXTERIOR: DESERT CAMPGROUND. DAY.=>ROCK CLIMBERS are high on the sheer face of a rock wall. MARY watches them. One CLIMBER rappels down the rock and lands beside them. He is lean, muscular, cool.

EXTERIOR: DESERT CAMPGROUND. DAY.=>A county sheriff's car drives into the campground. FOSTER MADISON gets out of it. MARY and SHARON pray at a picnic bench. Something about SHARON attracts him. He could be hard, but he is curious, soft.
FOSTER=>I'm Foster Madison.
EXTERIOR: DESERT CAMPGROUND. NIGHT.=>The moon is behind clouds. Wind pulls at the tent flaps.

INTERIOR: SHARON'S CAR. NIGHT.=>SHARON speeds down the highway, and everywhere she looks she sees a white horse flashing in her vision.
EXTERIOR: FREEWAY. NIGHT.=>SHARON keeps speeding. The white horse is gone. And then the red lights of a sheriff's police car appear in the mirror. The siren is close. She is sure she has been caught. She
INTERIOR: PRISON. DAY.=>A guard leads SHARON down a row of cells. A door is opened and then locked behind her. A woman on the next bed is reading the Bible, and when she lowers the book, we see it is ANGIE, the swinger with the tattoo. SHARON says nothing to her.
INTERIOR: PRISON CELL. NIGHT.=>SHARON hears a sound from her cell. A flaming sword slices the air. The sword stops flaming when it cuts through the air. The sword is held by the ARCHANGEL MICHAEL. ANGIE sleeps.
INTERIOR: PRISON. NIGHT.=>We move through the cells. A trumpet plays one long, extended note. The prisoners look outside.

EXTERIOR: LIMBO. NIGHT.=>We are in the dark. The noise has stopped. Then we see them, barely lit, a hint of something like moonlight on them. A voice, MARY'S:
MARY=>That isn't enough.
