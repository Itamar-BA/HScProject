WOMAN'S VOICE=>Hey. Wait!
WOMAN=>Where are you going?
JIM=>Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
WOMAN=>You must be going somewhere.
JIM=>I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
WOMAN=>Mind if I come along for the ride?
WOMAN=>I'm stranded out here.
JIM=>Hop in.
WOMAN=>Where did you learn to fight like that?
JIM=>I read a book.
WOMAN=>Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks. I admit this is...unusual.
JIM=>Are you a regular there?
WOMAN=>Are you serious? My boyfriend ditched me...
JIM=>Ditched you?
WOMAN=>We were fighting - I told him to let me out. So where are you headed?
JIM=>Bartender said there are motels south of here.
WOMAN=>Would you be into...getting a room?
JIM=>What would your - boyfriend - think?
WOMAN=>Screw him!
JIM=>You don't seem afraid of much.
WOMAN=>Not with this...
JIM=>You should have told me ahead of time, saved me the trouble.
JIM=>My name's Jim...
WOMAN=>Stephanie...
JIM=>Afraid your boyfriend will show up?
STEPHANIE=>You never know. He can be...psychotic some times.
STEPHANIE=>So where are you from?
JIM=>Up north.
STEPHANIE=>Where up north?
JIM=>Seattle.
STEPHANIE=>You got any family?
JIM=>No...
STEPHANIE=>You're the mysterious type, right?
JIM=>I'm running from my psychotic girlfriend.
STEPHANIE=>OK, no more questions...
STEPHANIE=>Mind if I turn out the light?
JIM=>No...
STEPHANIE=>You know, you don't seem afraid of much either. How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
JIM=>Figure you would have tried it already.
JIM=>You always carry a gun with you?
STEPHANIE=>No.
JIM=>Only on dates?
STEPHANIE=>I just listen to my instincts.
JIM=>What are your instincts telling you now?
STEPHANIE=>Stay out of trouble...
JIM=>Son of a bitch!
JIM=>Thanks.

COP2=>Shit...he's a goddamn lieutenant -
JIM=>He was trying to kill me!
COP1=>I said don't move you son-of a-bitch! You wanna die right here?!
COP2=>I'm calling it in -
DOYLE=>What do we have?
COP1=>Detective Tom Fleming, from Central division. He was dead before we got here.
DOYLE=>Shit...what the hell was he doing up here?
COP2=>Off duty? Who knows. The house is trashed, and the suspect isn't saying much.
DOYLE=>Where is this - suspect?
COP2=>Inside. CUT TO
DOYLE=>Who lives here?
COP2=>Car's registered to a Sarah Williams. The neighbor across the street saw the suspect driving the car, and hopping the fence to the backyard.
DOYLE=>Did you read him his rights?
COP2=>Yeah...
DOYLE=>Alright, where is she?
JIM=>And who are you?
DOYLE=>Who am I? I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me. You understand? Where did you get the car!
JIM=>I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
JIM=>No - that's not it! She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
MARVOSA=>Did you have sex with her?
JIM=>What?
MARVOSA=>Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
JIM=>No. It wasn't like that!
MARVOSA=>Then what did you do, play canasta?
DEFENDER=>I - uh, believe my client has asnwered that question sufficiently...
DOYLE=>Anyhow... you wake up and she's gone. But-- --this is my favorite part-- she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
JIM=>She stole my car!!
MARVOSA=>Bullshit...
DOYLE=>Did you report it stolen?
DOYLE=>So... to get the car back, you break into her house.
JIM=>I didn't break in - the back door was open!
DOYLE=>Yeah, it was opened - with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
DOYLE=>I gotta tell you something, son. I think you're trying to make a fool of me. You're driving a stolen car, the owner is missing, her house is ransacked, and a police officer's dead!
JIM=>I told you it was self-defense! He was trying to kill me!
MARVOSA=>You can cut the shit, asshole--
DOYLE=>we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
DOYLE=>Take him down to C.J. Get him out of my sight. CUT TO:

JIM=>Aaah - Jesus! -
JIM=>What are you, crazy!!
STANTON=>Now...
STANTON=>...you're going to tell us everything. You're gonna tell us where the whore is heading, what she told you - everything.
JIM=>I don't know anything about her - what the hell do you want???!!! They grab him by the throat and SHOVE his face in the dirty water - Jim struggles but the two cops are clearly in charge-
MARVOSA=>This is nothing, man! Now you're going to die tonight, understand? You just have to decide how you want to do it. The easy way or the -
MARVOSA=>- hard way!!!
STANTON=>What's it gonna be hard ass? Start talking -
JIM=>Fuck you! CUT TO INT WAREHOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
MARVOSA=>You know, I'd really like to believe you because I got better things to do with my night, understand? I got a c-note on the Colts Dolphins game and I'm sitting here with a scumbag that's lying to me!!!
JIM=>You're...crazy...
STANTON=>No...
STANTON=>...you're stupid!
STANTON=>Now where...is...the whore?

MARVOSA=>6A15 we have an officer down - 1400 North Baldwin...
OPERATOR=>All units stand by - 6A65 respond, code three 1400 North Baldwin...
DOYLE=>What the hell happened?
MARVOSA=>He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot. We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
DOYLE=>Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
MARVOSA=>It happened too fast. He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone. We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
DOYLE=>I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
MARVOSA=>Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
DOYLE=>Bullshit! Another officer dead?! There's no excuse for this! Now I want this son- of-a-bitch back in custody tonight, you understand?
DOYLE=>Does everyone understand?! We have a cop killer on the loose. I want to set a wider perimeter - three miles - units at Baldwin, Temple, Nelson and Austin. No vehicles come in or out! We're looking for a man in his 30's six feet, one eighty-five, dark hair, black jacket, wounded, and cuffed.

ROARS=>overhead, beaming a powerful and precise WHITE LIGHT through the narrow alleyway
BUM=>Fuck off! Pigs!
OFFICER=>Well, the dogs found a blood trail, so we know he's wounded.
MARVOSA=>I clipped him pretty good.
DOYLE=>So...either we find his stiff ass in an alley or we nail him at a hospital. Helps the odds a little.
DOYLE=>Zydowski. It's about time.
ZYDOWSKI=>You won't like this. I ran the prints from the house. No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
DOYLE=>Yeah?
ZYDOWSKI=>Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
DOYLE=>What? Wait a minute -
ZYDOWSKI=>That's not all. According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
DOYLE=>That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball. Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
OFFICER'S VOICE=>Captain!
OFFICER=>We found these in the alley.
DOYLE=>What the hell is this Marvosa!!
MARVOSA=>He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
DOYLE=>Great. Well that changes a lot...
MARVOSA=>I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
DOYLE=>We're all gonna fan out! C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
DOYLE=>And Marvosa!
DOYLE=>Don't take any chances. Call for back-up this time!

D.T.=>Yeah?... CUT TO INT UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT
MARVOSA=>It's Marvosa -

MARVOSA=>The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
MARVOSA=>He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
D.T.=>So what?
MARVOSA=>So what is they have enough to shut us down!
D.T.=>You mean shut your ass down!
MARVOSA=>No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
D.T.=>So what do you want me to do about it man?
MARVOSA=>I'm in Rosemead now, when I get information I want everyone ready to roll. We gotta get to him first. I'm faxing you his picture now.

OPERATOR=>What yard?
DOYLE=>I don't know - by Marshfield -
OPERATOR=>Six-One Charlie you have the air, go. All units stay off the air -
DOYLE=>Light, lets get some light in here!
MARVOSA=>Did you hit him?
DOYLE=>I didn't hit shit!
DOYLE=>I want someone from City Maintenance down here. I want to know every place this damn thing leads to. And get backup at every station it runs through!
FINISH THIS=>Officers shine flashlights in the dark tunnel
STEPHANIE=>Stay out of trouble... CUT TO

STORE OWNER=>What are you deaf! I said take off!
STORE OWNER=>Damn junkies...
KILLER=>ELUDES POLICE" -
LURCH=>The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
DOYLE=>And he took a swing at you?
LURCH=>Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
DOYLE=>Did he harm the girl?
LURCH=>Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
DOYLE=>Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
DOYLE=>Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
LURCH=>Alright, alright! We were just fucking with him..you know?
WEENER=>Yeah...he was fucking with him!
LURCH=>I was just having a little fun -
DOYLE=>And what did he do to the girl?
LURCH=>Nothing! He didn't do nothing!
WEENER=>He just left - she went after him!
DOYLE=>She went after him??
LURCH=>Don't ask me. I didn't see it.
WEENER=>He was out cold by then.
DOYLE=>Get their statement and get them out of here! CUT TO
PLAINCLOTHES=>Hey man...
PLAINCLOTHES=>I'm sorry. I heard about last night.
MARVOSA=>Yeah...
PLAINCLOTHES=>I heard Doyle went off on you. I don't know if I like that some-bitch too much.
MARVOSA=>He's not used to the way we do things. Well, you know, he's from the 77th. Coming here, trying to be a hard-ass, trying to prove himself.
DOYLE=>Marvosa!
DOYLE=>Come with me!
PLAINCLOTHES=>Don't you take any shit from him.
MARVOSA=>I don't take shit from anyone, Meadows. You know that.
MARVOSA=>What did the six-toes have to say?
DOYLE=>Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
MARVOSA=>So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
DOYLE=>But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
MARVOSA=>I don't know, shit. Maybe she was looking for love...
DOYLE=>Yeah - funny. There's something else I don't understand...I still wanna know why Fleming was up in Malibu last night.
DOYLE=>Find out for me.
MARVOSA=>Fine...
OFFICER=>Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
DOYLE=>Who is it?
OFFICER=>I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
CRAIG=>Captain Doyle?
DOYLE=>Yeah?
CRAIG=>Special Agent Craig, FBI.
DOYLE=>What can I do for you?
CRAIG=>Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
DOYLE=>Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
CRAIG=>Not on her. But as for Jim Trudell... do you mind if I close the door?
CRAIG=>We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
DOYLE=>We ran the i.d. I could have told you that.
CRAIG=>I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
DOYLE=>Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
CRAIG=>Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
DOYLE=>If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
CRAIG=>That's the point. He slipped up, and he's desperate now. And that means he's all the more dangerous.
CRAIG=>I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
DOYLE=>Cooperate?
CRAIG=>Every step of the way.
DOYLE=>If you guys want in, fine. Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
OFFICER=>Captain we got a store owner in Venice, made a stone-cold ID of Trudell about fifteen minutes ago.
DOYLE=>Goddamn he made it into Venice! OK we're back on the road! Notify all units, tell them we're on our way.
DOYLE=>Let's roll -

JIM=>Thank you...
COP=>Walk the bike.
DOYLE=>Alright, we know who we're looking for. Play it cool until the time is right to make a move. Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
CRAIG=>Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
DOYLE=>If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
MARVOSA=>These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
DOYLE=>I'm sure you can handle it. Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th. Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
MARVOSA=>I'll take the south end -
DOYLE=>Fine -
CRAIG=>You mind if I ride with you?
DOYLE=>Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
D.T.=>Yeah?
MARVOSA=>Where are you?
D.T.=>We're by Ozone...
MARVOSA=>You set to go -
D.T.=>What do you think?
MARVOSA=>Alright, stay on the phone.
ANGLO=>So what are we supposed to do, drive around all fucking day?
D.T.=>Look man, I don't like this motherfucker Marvosa any more than you but we got to do what he says.

TUBBS=>Holy shit -
JIM=>Hello Tubbs. Can I come in?
TUBBS=>Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
TUBBS=>Man I thought I dreamt that call last night. What the hell are you up to buddy? You look like shit - are you OK?
TUBBS=>Jimmy, are you flipping out on me? What's going on?
JIM=>I don't know...
TUBBS=>You don't know?
JIM=>No...
TUBBS=>Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
JIM=>Two cops are dead.
TUBBS=>And?...
JIM=>I killed them.
TUBBS=>Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
JIM=>Yeah I'm sure! I did it with my own hands!
TUBBS=>Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
JIM=>It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty! I walked in on something, I don't know what -
TUBBS=>You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
JIM=>They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
TUBBS=>Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive? I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
JIM=>I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
TUBBS=>Oh man...what happened?
JIM=>I don't know. But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
TUBBS=>Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times. What do you want to do?
JIM=>I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
TUBBS=>Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys. I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
JIM=>I've got a better idea...
TUBBS=>OK...where do you want to start?
JIM=>With a girl named Sarah Williams...
TUBBS=>OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network. I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county. None of them live in Hollywood. Do you remember the address?
JIM=>1490...Breckinridge...
TUBBS=>Let's see what we got...
TUBBS=>Donut?
JIM=>No thanks. How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
TUBBS=>I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe. If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
JIM=>I knew I could count on you.
TUBBS=>I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
JIM=>OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
JIM=>How about Marvosa and the others?
TUBBS=>I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
TUBBS=>So...what happened to you, Jimmy? I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
JIM=>I gave all that up. I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment. It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore... ...some things never change, I guess.
TUBBS=>You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
JIM=>What else is new?
TUBBS=>OK--I've got something here...personnnel records...on Fleming, Stanton, and Marvosa. Addresses, phone numbers... I'll cross reference them, see what we can find. CUT TO
ZYDOWSKI=>Did you read today's paper?
DOYLE=>No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
ZYDOWSKI=>Well read this -
DOYLE=>Something I don't already know?
ZYDOWSKI=>Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it? Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
DOYLE=>Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
ZYDOWSKI=>Could explain why Fleming was there.
DOYLE=>Forget it. This hooker's a red herring. Even the FBI came up short -
DOYLE=>Speak of the devil.
OFFICER=>They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
DOYLE=>Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way - You coming?
CRAIG=>I'll let you two handle it...
DOYLE=>And where the hell is Marvosa?
ZYDOWSKI=>He said he was following up some lead.
DOYLE=>Well let's get his ass to the garage! Some lead...
ULYSSES=>What happened with D.T?
MARVOSA=>D.T's shit-canned. So's Droopy. The other two will live.
ULYSSES=>Who is this guy?
MARVOSA=>I don't know if she hired him or what - he's damn good. And he's already fucking everything up, we could chop enough Benzes tonight to pick up half a million. To add to it I got this gung-ho son-of-a-bitch captain outta Compton snooping around - nothing's good!!! We got to get rid of this guy!
ULYSSES=>We will - are you willing to take it all the way? If you want pros it's gonna cost...
MARVOSA=>It's gonna cost everybody if we're shut down! It's just the price of doing business...
OPERATOR=>6A13 report to Burtell's Tow impound lot 401 North Magnolia -
MARVOSA=>Burtell's?

ZYDOWSKY=>What don't we have in here? We have CD player, radar detector, cell phone -
ZYDOWSKY=>Automatic weapons...
MARVOSA=>What's this?
DOYLE=>Our getaway car. You said a cell phone?
ZYDOWSKY=>Yeah...
DOYLE=>That might just be our ticket.
MARVOSA=>What do you mean?
ZYDOWSKI=>Maybe Jim Trudell called someone from the car.
MARVOSA=>He'd have to be really stupid to pull that. I mean - he must have known we would find the car.
ZYDOWSKI=>Maybe...but it would be even stupider not to check it out.
DOYLE=>Get the information for us. Call the phone company, find out what calls were made on this extension over the last 48 hours.
MARVOSA=>You got it.
DOYLE=>It's safe to assume that this guy has some kind of weapon on him...
ZYDOWSKY=>Well he had quite a selection to choose from. The question is - who's his next target?
DOYLE=>Marvosa--when did you join the force?
MARVOSA=>What?
DOYLE=>When did you join the force? You know, the police force, the place you work...
MARVOSA=>Nineteen eighty four. What fucking difference does it make?
DOYLE=>Did you start out area six?
MARVOSA=>Yeah...
DOYLE=>So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
MARVOSA=>Yeah I saw 'em around. They worked vice.
DOYLE=>Well don't you think that's odd?
MARVOSA=>What?
DOYLE=>It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
MARVOSA=>Gotta come from somewhere...
DOYLE=>Where do you come from, Marvosa?
MARVOSA=>Traffic...
DOYLE=>Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
MARVOSA=>Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know? I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
OFFICER=>Captain?
DOYLE=>Yeah?
OFFICER=>LAPD data center reports a breach on the system. An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
MARVOSA=>Outside hacker? What the fuck are you talking about?
DOYLE=>That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
OFFICER=>Yeah -
DOYLE=>Alright, I want SWAT on that building right away. Let's get down there and find out what the hell is going on.
DOYLE=>Something wrong with you Marvosa?
MARVOSA=>It's just...catching up with me, you know?
DOYLE=>Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
TUBBS=>OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas. And that's Switzerland's country code.
JIM=>A bank?
TUBBS=>Who knows? Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
JIM=>Both at the same bank...
TUBBS=>And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
JIM=>Where are they getting all this money?...
TUBBS=>Ahh, shit. We're pretty much tapped out. I'm getting denied access all over the place...
JIM=>It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
TUBBS=>Shit, we just started. But I better log out of this.
TUBBS=>Hello?
STEPHANIE=>I want to speak to Jim Trudell...
TUBBS=>I think you got the wrong number -
STEPHANIE=>I know he's there. If you want to live, you'll listen to me.
TUBBS=>Who is this! How the hell did you...
STEPHANIE=>There are five squad cars on the way to you right now. You've got to get out of there...I'll meet you at the brick building on the corner of Silverbay and Hoyt Park as soon as you can get there.
JIM=>What's going on here?
STEPHANIE=>You'll find out - soon enough.
TUBBS=>Oh - man! Now they've gone and done it!
TUBBS=>Man they're going to skin me alive! How the hell did they find out?!!
JIM=>That was her - the girl... We have to go.
TUBBS=>I'm not going anywhere!
JIM=>Tubbs, these people mean business.
TUBBS=>I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place! I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
TUBBS=>I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
JIM=>I'm going to need a way to get there.
TUBBS=>There's a Harley in the garage I don't exactly use anymore. Take it.
JIM=>Are you going to be alright?
TUBBS=>Don't worry about me... ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
TUBBS=>Don't you guys ever knock?
MARVOSA=>Where is he?
TUBBS=>Long gone...
MARVOSA=>Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
TUBBS=>Look around all you want. But walk lightly. I have a cake in the oven.
RADIO=>Six A fifteen, do you copy?
DOYLE=>Six A fifteen - go.
RADIO=>We've got a unit on the scene, reporting this address is coming up short. Looks like a Pic'n'Save - over?
DOYLE=>A Pic'n'Save!!
DOYLE=>Am I hearing correctly?
RADIO=>That is correct -
DOYLE=>We're on our way anyhow. I want to see it with my own eyes! Jesus... CUT TO INT TUBBS APARTMENT - NIGHT
MARVOSA=>Long gone, huh?
TUBBS=>I asked him not to tell me where he was going. I told him I don't want any part of it.
MARVOSA=>Oh yeah? You're a smart man?...
TUBBS=>Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
MARVOSA=>Nahhh...
MARVOSA=>I got better things to do...
STEPHANIE=>Hello, Jim.
CRAIG=>Hands in the air.
STEPHANIE=>I understand there's a lot of people looking for you. I know how that can feel. CUT TO:
JIM=>Why did you set me up?
STEPHANIE=>I didn't. I figured you leave it well enough alone.
JIM=>Well you figured wrong! And now I'm public enemy number one. You have an answer for that?
STEPHANIE=>I had to get away! My life was in danger!
JIM=>Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
STEPHANIE=>No. A witness.
JIM=>What exactly did you see?
STEPHANIE=>Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
JIM=>No, but I'm listening.
STEPHANIE=>I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals. I was in the bathroom when it happened.
JIM=>Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
STEPHANIE=>Yeah...they did. One girl...
STEPHANIE=>Charlie Fletcher liked to move around a lot, but he was a regular. And he paid for the kink.
STEPHANIE=>I had to call another appointment and cancel. Fletcher wanted to party all night, and he made it worth my while. But then I heard the front door open...and I heard voices...
FLETCHER=>What the hell are you doing here!
MARVOSA=>Stomping a pigeon.
STANTON=>You're done rocking the boat Fletcher.
FLETCHER=>Jesus!!! Don't kill me - please!!
MARVOSA=>You're gonna take care of that!
FLETCHER=>Let go! Aaaahhh--
STEPHANIE=>It seemed like I waited for ever before coming out, and when I did I saw them.
STEPHANIE=>They were dead. No struggle, no commotion - just dead.
JIM=>And what did you do?
STEPHANIE=>I got out of there. I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
JIM=>Found what?
STEPHANIE=>I was grabbing up everything I had when I noticed something behind the curtain.
STEPHANIE=>It seems Charlie liked to watch. Over and over.
STEPHANIE=>I had it all on tape...
JIM=>What did you do then?
STEPHANIE=>I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want. That's where I met him - told him what I had. The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow. So I ran...and met you.
JIM=>What happened with the tape?
STEPHANIE=>I took it with me. It's in a safe place.
JIM=>So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
CRAIG=>Yes. They were using the city resources to steal and fence luxury cars, then making sure the thefts weren't followed up. It's a very lucrative business nowadays.
JIM=>And you just did nothing?
CRAIG=>At first I didn't know. We were waiting for the right time to act. Fortunately Stephanie had the good sense to do the right thing. Unfortunately for you, I received a better offer.
STEPHANIE=>What?
CRAIG=>Like I said...it's a very lucrative business.
CRAIG=>You want to make your best move? Go ahead...just give me a reason...
MARVOSA=>Before you try anything, you better look out the window. Go ahead!
CONNOR,=>DAVIS, EDGAR, and ULYSSES -
CRAIG=>Lets get our hands in the air, and let's move it. And remember, I'm a jumpy kind of guy, so try not to make any sudden moves.
CRAIG=>Now you are going to come with us. I know a smart girl like you made copies of that tape, and we're going to find out what you did with each and every one of them.
MARVOSA=>I'm gonna enjoy this -
ULYSSES=>Shit! Let's go! CUT TO INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
JIM=>Come on - CUT TO INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
MARVOSA=>Shit!
ULYSSES=>Get out!
ULYSSES=>Aaaahh!
MARVOSA=>Get the fuck in!!
STEPHANIE=>Did we lose them?
JIM=>No! Hang on!
MARVOSA=>Gimme the gun! Now!
JIM=>Shit!!
JIM=>Hold on!
DRIVER=>Hey!
STEPHANIE=>Jim!!!
MARVOSA=>Where you gonna run now!!
DOYLE=>Drop it or we take you out right here -
DOYLE=>Alright c'mon out! Hands in the air!
STEPHANIE=>He was trying to kill us - it was -
DOYLE=>I know I know - it was self defense.
DOYLE=>You must be Sarah...
STEPHANIE=>Stephanie.
DOYLE=>Whatever... Let's go...you got a lot of 'splaining to do...
STEPHANIE=>There's plenty more where this came from...here...
DOYLE=>What is it?
STEPHANIE=>I don't want to ruin the surprise.
DOYLE=>More surprises, that's all I need... I tell you, retirement's looking better everyday...
DOYLE=>Are you alright?
JIM=>I'll live...
DOYLE=>I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
JIM=>It wasn't in the cards.
DOYLE=>We better get going...
JIM=>There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
STEPHANIE=>Yeah.
JIM=>Where the hell is my car?
STEPHANIE=>Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
JIM=>No -
STEPHANIE=>Neither did I. I'll make it up to you, I promise...
