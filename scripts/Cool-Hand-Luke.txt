DRAGLINE=>Get outa mah way you don't want a wet pocket!
SOCIETY RED=>Gentlemen, welcome to the Family.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Any of you guys from Connecticut?
CARR=>Awright, let's move it along!
DRAGLINE=>Fill your loudmouth with some beans!
CARR=>Well, what are you doin' here? You supposed to be eatin' them beans!
KOKO=>Newmeat's a hog-gut.
DOGBOY=>These pigs is rollin' in thar slops now, Boss!
DYNAMITE=>Next time you stay outa my place! I earned it. You try that agin an' I'll bounce you all over the floor.
TRAMP=>I didn't know. I was hungry.
KOKO=>You don't take another man's place, boy.
ALIBI=>It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
DRAGLINE=>You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
KOKO=>Tramp! Beautiful!
GAMBLER=>You got your bullgang name, boy.
TRAMP=>Ain't no worse than some I been called.
TATTOO=>In the Navy, we used to call guys --
DRAGLINE=>Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
DRAGLINE=>Somebody say somethin'?
LUKE=>I didn't say nothin', Boss.
DRAGLINE=>Well, whatta we got here?
LUKE=>A Lucas Jackson.
SOCIETY RED=>Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
DRAGLINE=>Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
LUKE=>Ain't heard much worth listening to yet. Just everybody handing out rules.
KOKO=>Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
DRAGLINE=>Wouldn't surprise me none. Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
SOCIETY RED=>Looks like you've got yourself a redhot, Dragline.
GAMBLER=>Awright, let's play some poker. First Jack is the Man... a trey, a duck, a neighter...
CARR=>First bell!
CARR=>Last bell. Last bell.
CARR=>Fifty, Boss.
WICKER MAN=>Fifty. Okay, Carr.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE'S VOICE=>Gittin' up here, Carr.
CARR=>Yeeahp.
CARR=>First bell! First bell! Let's go!
DRAGLINE'S VOICE=>Git outa my eyeballin' seat, you Newmeat dummy!
ALIBI=>Where are we going now?
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>It's the Captain's birthday. They're takin' us on a picnic.
ALIBI=>I'm a salesman. I used to drive these roads all the time. I never thought -- it was an accident, car skidded, maybe I'd had a drink or two --
KOKO=>Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
GAMBLER=>Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
MECHANIC=>You ever seen a man bearcaught?
GAMBLER=>All the salt goes outa his body and the water follers the salt and the brain shrivels up like a dried pea.
TATTOO=>When I was in the Navy --
SOCIETY RED=>Convulsions, shivering. Very unpleasant to watch.
BLIND DICK=>Man's never the same. Makes him lose his sex drive.
KOKO=>I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
ALIBI=>We work down in the ditch?
GAMBLER=>Ain't you never seen a chain gang, in all your driving around?
TRAMP=>I ain't used to hard labor neither. Done my best to avoid it.
TATTOO=>I ain't crazy about it myself.
KOKO=>Gonna be a hot one to learn on.
SOCIETY RED=>Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
KOKO=>Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
TRAMP=>I shore would appreciate it. I ain't in much shape just now.
TATTOO=>What about me?
SOCIETY RED=>Perhaps if you offered Brother Koko a small...
TRAMP=>I ain't got much. A quarter?
DRAGLINE=>You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
TATTOO=>I'll give you fifty cents.
KOKO=>Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
ALIBI=>I'll make it a dollar.
KOKO=>Buck is a deal.
ALIBI=>I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
TRAMP=>If you even need dough in here, I'm in big trouble.
LUKE=>Where'd you get that about war hero?
DRAGLINE=>Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
LUKE=>Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
SOCIETY RED=>You'll have to do better than that if you want to impress these men. Some pretty hard numbers here. Dragline's an ex-safe cracker, Koko's a jewel thief. Blind Dick is a rapist.
BLIND DICK=>Show you the clippings some time. News-Dispatch called me "The Shiek of Simmonsville." Five broads in three days...
GAMBLER=>'Course two of them were sisters.
SOCIETY RED=>Of course some of them, like Stupid Blondie, were just unlucky... he fell off the fire escape... and one or two don't really belong here at all... ...or myself, who just made the small error of misspelling a friend's name... on a check.
DRAGLINE=>Hey, Koko. You hear that? All this time I been thinkin' Society just come here for the sun and exercise.
DRAGLINE=>Whatta you so happy about?
LUKE=>I just always did like truck rides.
ALIBI=>Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
BOSS PAUL=>Git your shovel and git to work.
ALIBI=>I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
BOSS PAUL=>Git movin', I said.
ALIBI=>But I made this arrangement --
BOSS PAUL=>Cut that backsass!
SOCIETY RED=>You're working too hard. You won't last two hours. Watch the way the Human Dragline does it.
DRAGLINE=>Takin' it off here, Boss!
BOSS PAUL=>Yeah, take it off there.
TATTOO=>Takin' it off here, Boss?
BOSS PAUL=>Yeah, take if off there.
DRAGLINE=>Hey, turn around! Let Koko see the broad.
KOKO=>Beautiful! A real work of art!
BLIND DICK=>Nice broad. Good set.
TATTOO=>Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
DRAGLINE=>Hey, Tattoo!
TATTOO=>-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
MECHANIC=>Hey. Swing that yoyo or you gonna get a taste of that cane.
DRAGLINE=>Man bearcaught, boss!
BOSS KEAN=>Blondie... Sleepy! Git him afore he falls.
BOSS KEAN=>Awright, let's eat them beans!
BOSS KEAN'S VOICE=>Hey, you. Bean time!
DRAGLINE=>Cold drink he don't make it.
GAMBLER=>Bet. Babalugats, bet!
DRAGLINE=>You got to snag it, man. You got to stop foolin' around and tear up them weeds.
STUPID BLONDIE=>Caught short here, boss!
BOSS KEAN=>Awright, Blondie. Take it behind that tree.
TATTOO=>Who's that?
KOKO=>Boss Godfrey.
MECHANIC=>The walking boss.
TATTOO=>Don't he ever talk?
LUKE=>I believe he just said something.
LUKE=>You owe that fella a cold drink.
KOKO=>Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
ALIBI=>I got two years.
DRAGLINE=>Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
TATTOO=>I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
KOKO=>Oh, man, oh man. Look at that. On the bicycle. Lookit them shorts. I'm dyin'.
DRAGLINE=>She looks just like a lil girl I useta know named Louise Merryweather. Fine lil ol' girl, always partial to home-made whiskey. Remember one time down in the cellar, both of us knee- walkin' drunk and ah had this lil pint and Louise wanted a poke of it. So ah said: you wanna poke and I wanna poke, so...
BOSS HIGGINS=>Awright, you, Gibson, step out. Boss Paul says you wasn't happy with your job. Done a lot of complainin'. Gone give you a chance to think it over.
BOSS HIGGINS=>Get them clothes off.
CARR=>Awright, first bell! Let's hit them bunks!
DRAGLINE=>Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
LUKE=>Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
KOKO=>Man, I never thought they'd put him in the box on his first day.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>It was just supposed to be a joke. There ain't no brooms. Whoever heard of a chain gang using brooms?
TRAMP=>I gotta tell you that I believed it.
TATTOO=>He should have known; it was a gag.
KOKO=>You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
SOCIETY RED=>You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
LUKE=>Well, you fixed it up so he's got all night to think about it.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>It's not our fault he's a square.
DRAGLINE=>Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
LUKE=>Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
DRAGLINE=>You tryin' to say somethin'?
DRAGLINE=>You jus' keep flapping your mouth and one of these times, you and me gonna raise a little dust.
CARR=>Awright, last bell!
CARR=>Forty-nine and one in the box, Boss!
WICKER MAN'S VOICE=>Forty-nine and one in the box. Right, Carr.
DRAGLINE=>Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
LUKE=>I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
DRAGLINE=>Puttin' 'em on here, Boss!
BOSS KEAN'S VOICE=>Yeah, put 'em on, Drag!
LUKE=>Lookit that. Some Hollywood movie star jus' joined up with us.
DRAGLINE=>Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
LUKE=>But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
TRAMP=>Coulda fooled me.
DRAGLINE=>These is my eyeballin' glasses. Now I'm gonna play peek-a-boo and ol' Godfrey ain't gonna know if I'm eyeballin' or tootin' the piccolo.
TATTOO=>That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
DRAGLINE=>Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
KOKO=>Man, see her legs. She's tanned all over.
BLIND DICK=>Nice broad. Nice set.
DRAGLINE=>She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
KOKO=>Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
LUKE=>Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
DRAGLINE=>Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
KOKO=>Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
DRAGLINE=>I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
BLIND DICK=>Nice broad. Good set.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>How could you tell? You could hardly see her.
GAMBLER=>She's back!
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Look at that!
DRAGLINE=>Shut up, you loudmouth jerk!
KOKO=>Man Oh Man.
LUKE=>That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
BLIND DICK=>Lookit her bounce.
GAMBLER=>Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
TRAMP=>I wouldn't mind being that hose.
GAMBLER=>More... a little more.
TATTOO=>I don't know if I believe it.
BLONDIE=>She's so big!
GAMBLER=>Now lean down... a little more.
DRAGLINE=>Lookit that little honeypot. Lookit those legs.
MECHANIC=>Oh man, I ain't never been so thirsty in my life.
BLIND DICK=>Oh rub.
SLEEPY=>Rub.
DRAGLINE=>Rub!
BABALUGATS=>Rub-a-dub-dub. Rub-a-dub-dub.
KOKO=>I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
DRAGLINE=>Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
LUKE=>Lucille? Where do you get that?
DRAGLINE=>That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
LUKE=>Innocent?
BLIND DICK=>She don't even know what she's doin!.
LUKE=>She knows exactly what she's doin. She's drivin' you crazy and lovin' it.
DRAGLINE=>Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
LUKE=>Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
DRAGLINE=>Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
SLEEPY=>Babalugats, shut up.
MECHANIC=>Leave him alone. He's happy.
SLEEPY=>That's because he's a damn moron.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Now why don't you just shut up?
CARR=>Awright, last bell.
CARR'S VOICE=>Fifty, Boss.
WICKERMAN'S VOICE=>Fifty, right, Carr.
KOKO=>Man, it's so hot.
GAMBLER=>Gettin' up, Carr.
CARR=>Yeahhpp.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Giddyap, Carr.
CARR'S VOICE=>Yeahhpp.
TRAMP=>How can you sleep with that damn squeaking!
DYNAMITE'S VOICE=>Gettin' up, Carr.
CARR=>Yeahhp.
DRAGLINE=>Man, that lil Lucille was a lot of lil girl.
DRAGLINE'S VOICE=>You see how she was jus' poppin' outa the top of that dress.
KOKO=>Aw, come on, Drag.
DRAGLINE=>And down below, that thing didn't reach no higher than... She liable to catch cold... runnin' around like that.
DRAGLINE'S VOICE=>...And that thing was so tight 'cross her bottom... made me wanna just reach out my hands and...
LUKE=>Forget it, man.
DRAGLINE=>Whatta you mean, forget it?
LUKE=>Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
DRAGLINE=>Boy, you better get some sleep and save your strength. 'Cause you're gonna need it.
TRAMP=>Why don't you just stay there? He's only gonna knock you down agin.
ALIBI=>It's not your fault. He's just too big.
SOCIETY RED=>Let him hit you in the nose, get some blood flowing. Maybe they'll stop it before he kills you.
LUKE=>I don't want to frighten him.
DRAGLINE=>Ommana pop you one easy. Stay down.
DRAGLINE=>I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
LUKE=>That's what you're gonna have to do.
GAMBLER=>Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
KOKO=>Cuter.
GAMBLER=>Ace calls.
LUKE=>Kick a buck.
KOKO=>I'm in.
GAMBLER=>Ace calls. Here we go. King-five gets a tray for no help. Paira ninas gets a Jack. Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
KOKO=>Cuter again.

DRAGLINE=>Whatcha got?
KOKO=>Pair'a nines.
DRAGLINE=>I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
DRAGLINE=>Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
KOKO=>He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
DRAGLINE=>So then you just call him.
KOKO=>I call.
GAMBLER=>I gotta believe. Out! Now they're rollin'. King-five-four gets an eight. Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
KOKO=>Cuter.
LUKE=>Kick a buck.
KOKO=>Damn.
DRAGLINE=>Kick him back a buck!
KOKO=>Back a buck.
LUKE=>Kick a buck.
DRAGLINE=>Don't look at me, mullet-head.
GAMBLER=>Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
KOKO=>I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
BLIND DICK=>Gotta have kings.
GAMBLER=>Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
DRAGLINE=>Man's got a paira kings, get your tail out.
DRAGLINE=>Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'! You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
LUKE=>Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
DRAGLINE=>Cool Hand Luke.
KOKO=>Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
GAMBLER=>All the bears gonna be walking today.
ALIBI=>What's the deal?
DRAGLINE=>Tar truck.
KOKO=>You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
SOCIETY RED=>This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
TRAMP=>I ain't forgot.
BOSS PAUL=>Awright, every second man, git to the other side of the road.
BOSS PAUL=>Captain heard this gang been doin' so good, gave us this special job. We got three miles of tarrin' to cover today. Let's roll it!
BOSS PAUL=>Let's git with it!
BOSS SHORTY=>Roll it, heah?
KOKO=>Oh man. I'm gonna twist my arm off if this heat don't kill me first.
BOSS PAUL=>Roll it!
DRAGLINE=>Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
LUKE=>The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
DYNAMITE=>Whatta we racin' for?
DRAGLINE=>Man wants speed, let's give it to him. Use that shovel like you use your spoon. Shag it, man!
BLIND DICK=>Go hard!
GAMBLER=>Ram it in and break it off!
ALIBI=>Roll it!
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Shag it!
DRAGLINE=>They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
LUKE=>They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
SOCIETY RED=>Work those shovels instead of your mouths.
TRAMP=>Go hard!
TATTOO=>Ram it in...
MECHANIC=>Break it off...
SOCIETY RED=>Roll it!
DYNAMITE=>Shag it!
STUPID BLONDIE=>Move it!
BOSS PAUL=>Rabbit! What the hell's goin' on?
RABBIT=>I don't know, Boss. They must be bearcaught. All of them.
DRAGLINE=>Where'd the road go?
LUKE=>That's it. That's the end.
KOKO=>But there's still daylight left.
DRAGLINE=>'Bout two hours left.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>What do we do now?
LUKE=>Nothin'.
DRAGLINE=>Oh, Luke, you wild beautiful thing! You crazy handful of nuthin'!
WICKERMAN=>Visitor for Luke!
GAMBLER=>Steve. Your mother's here!
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Jeez! She never lets me alone.
TRAMP=>You oughta be glad you got somebody.
ALIBI=>My wife hasn't been here for a month. She must be sick again. She's had this condition of the liver for...
TATTOO=>Alibi, can't you never say nothin' without explainin' it? Carr says you even explain when you get up at night.
LUKE=>Comin' out here, Boss?
BOSS PAUL=>Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
LUKE=>How'd you find me?
ARLETTA=>Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
LUKE=>Yeah. Well. Gettin' up here, Boss.
LUKE=>Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
ARLETTA=>I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
LUKE=>Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
ARLETTA=>Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
LUKE=>Smokin' it up here, Boss.
LUKE=>Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
ARLETTA=>No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
LUKE=>You never thought that's a heavy load?
ARLETTA=>We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
LUKE=>No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
ARLETTA=>Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
LUKE=>Yeah.
ARLETTA=>What are you doin' here?
LUKE=>We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
ARLETTA=>I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
LUKE=>You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
ARLETTA=>Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
LUKE=>Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
ARLETTA=>He'd... He'd of... broke you up.
ARLETTA=>You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
LUKE=>Here, Mom.
ARLETTA=>What went wrong?
LUKE=>Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
ARLETTA=>No.
LUKE=>Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
ARLETTA=>You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
LUKE=>She took off with that convertible feller...
ARLETTA=>Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
LUKE=>Yeah.
ARLETTA=>I'm leavin' the place to John.
LUKE=>That's good: he earned it.
ARLETTA=>Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
LUKE=>Gotta go, Arletta.
ARLETTA=>Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
JOHN-BOY=>Why can't you have chains?
JOHN-BOY=>Uncle Luke?
JOHN=>John-Boy looks to you. You're a hero. He's braggin' on you all over the county.
LUKE=>Yeah.
JOHN=>You must've really flung a binge this time. You really hit that cop?
LUKE=>Much as I'd like to oblige you, John, I didn't hit the cop. She's in pretty bad pain, ain't she?
JOHN=>Fulla dope, Luke.
LUKE=>Keep it with her all the time. Let her have all she wants.
LUKE=>You don't want to admire them chains, John-Boy. They ain't medals. You get them put on for makin' mistakes. And if you make a really bad mistake, then you got to deal with the Man... and he is one tough old boy.
LUKE=>So long, Arletta. Take care.
ARLETTA'S VOICE=>You know it, kid.
JOHN=>Now there's nothin' for you to come back for.
ALIBI=>I guess they have to close those things, or we'd drown. But it's really suffocating.
TATTOO=>Talk about drownin', I did some trainin' on a submarine once. Boy, when you're under there you really feel it.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Shut up, man. It's too hot to talk.
DRAGLINE=>You see mah skinny lid boy at chow tonight. He was matching you plate for plate.
DYNAMITE=>I wasn't feelin' good. Think I got a ulcer or somethin'.
DRAGLINE=>He had a spoon like yours, he'd make you look like a possum [...] on a tree bark.
SOCIETY RED=>Oh, come on, Clarence.
DRAGLINE=>What do you mean, Clarence? You callin' me a liar?
SOCIETY RED=>Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
DRAGLINE=>He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
LUKE=>I can eat fifty eggs.
DRAGLINE=>Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
SOCIETY RED=>You just said he could eat anything.
DRAGLINE=>You ever eat fifty eggs?
LUKE=>Nobody ever ate fifty eggs.
GAMBLER=>Bet! Bet! Babalugats!
DRAGLINE=>Mah boy say he kin eat fifty eggs, he'll eat fifty eggs.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Yeah but in how long?
LUKE=>One hour.
SOCIETY RED=>Well I believe I'll have to take part of that wager.
DRAGLINE=>Two bucks.
GAMBLER=>Let's talk money.
DRAGLINE=>Awright, twenty bucks. Anything! The Syndicate'll cover any money you got. Koko, get paper.
KOKO=>Dragline... fifty eggs got to weigh a good six pounds.
DYNAMITE=>Man's gut can't hold that. They'll swell up and bust him open.
BLIND DICK=>You're gonna kill him.
DRAGLINE=>Getcha money, up. Gambler! Dynamite! Everybody. Kokonut Head here is taking the money. Loudmouth -- get it up!
GAMBLER=>How's he gonna eat 'em?
LUKE=>Boiled for fifteen minutes. Then peeled. I eat all fifty in one hour.
DRAGLINE=>Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
SOCIETY RED=>One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
DRAGLINE=>You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
DRAGLINE=>Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
LUKE=>Fifty's a nice round number.
DRAGLINE=>Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
LUKE=>Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
DRAGLINE=>What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
LUKE=>We got it locked in the sock.
DRAGLINE=>Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
LUKE=>You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
DRAGLINE=>'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
LUKE=>Like an elephant.
DRAGLINE=>Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
DOGBOY=>Lookit this hot gut, Boss. Here's a man gone bust the State feedin' his face.
BOSS HIGGINS=>Wisht I could eat like that.
LUKE=>Thing about bad food, you got to eat a lot of it.
DRAGLINE=>Boss! Man needs a brown bomber and a dose of salts.
SOCIETY RED=>Rules Committee! Rules Committee!
ALIBI=>Nobody said nothin' about that!
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Same as dopin' a race horse!
SLEEPY=>It don't sound right.
TATTOO=>You can't do that!
DRAGLINE=>You jes' watch us!
BLIND DICK=>Fair's fair.
KOKO=>Got a right to start with a clear gut!
DYNAMITE=>Man can't eat that much no matter --
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>You can't just change the rules any way you want!
DRAGLINE=>Take it easy now, Jabo. Them is eggs, not them cathead biscuits.
JABO=>I know what eggs look like. I ain't seen any around here for three years, but I remember.
RABBIT=>I've got it figured. If he eats an egg a minute, he's got 10 minutes left to swaller them.
CHIEF=>I just got sent five bucks from the rodeo company.
RABBIT=>What for?
CHIEF=>A bull I fell off.
DRAGLINE=>Awright! Stand back, you pedestrians, this ain't no automobile accident!
ALIBI=>You're peeling his eggs!
DRAGLINE=>That's right, Mister Alibi.
SOCIETY RED=>He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
DRAGLINE=>You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Who made what law about peeling his eggs?
DRAGLINE=>I'm his trainer, I'm the syndicate what's coverin' all bets, and I'm his official egg peeler.
SOCIETY RED=>Just wait till the hour starts, that's all.
LUKE=>What's goin' on?
SOCIETY RED=>One, two, three...
KOKO=>He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
SOCIETY RED=>...twenty-four. Twenty-five, twenty- six...
DRAGLINE=>Slow down a little.
SOCIETY RED=>...thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two.
SOCIETY RED=>Eighteen to go!
GAMBLER=>He's had it. I'm throwin' in my last tenner.
BLIND DICK=>He don't look good.
DYNAMITE=>Man's gut can't hold more'n that.
GAMBLER=>Oh you gonna come crawlin' around beggin' for a cold drink, Drag. Your boy is done for!
MECHANIC=>If I give you a dollar and he don't eat all fifty eggs, I get two dollars?
DRAGLINE=>Mechanic!
DRAGLINE=>You're a sweet old boy and I don't like to see you pick up no bad habits. Better use that dollar to buy yourself a new spark plug or something. But as long as you done took a stand, why don't you put some money where your mouth is? Not no measly buck!
MECHANIC=>All I got is three-seventy-five.
DRAGLINE=>It's a bet! Koko! I gone this far, I'm backin' mah boy all the way! Come on, who's next? Where are the big money men, I want to hear from some high rollers.
SOCIETY RED=>I believe you've got it all, Dragline. Every nickel in camp is riding.
SOCIETY RED'S VOICE=>Thirty-three.
ALIBI=>Carr? What's the time?
CARR=>Twenty-four minutes to go.
SOCIETY RED=>Thirty-four.
SOCIETY RED=>Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
DRAGLINE=>Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Carr? Time?
CARR=>Six minutes to go, Dragline.
DRAGLINE=>Just shakin' it down, that's all, settlin' them eggs down...
DRAGLINE=>Come on, Baby... don't be that way. Open your little ol' gator mouth.
SOCIETY RED=>Forty-four...
CARR=>Two minutes to time...
DRAGLINE=>All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
SOCIETY RED=>Forty-five.
CARR=>One minute, thirty seconds.
DRAGLINE=>That's it, that's how to do it, chew, chew, chew!
CARR=>One minute, fifty-five... fifty... forty-five... etc.
SOCIETY RED=>Forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven...
DRAGLINE=>All in: that's it: chew, chew, chew!
CARR=>Fifteen, ten, nine, eight, seven... six...
CARR=>One... zero!
SOCIETY RED=>He didn't swallow the last...
DRAGLINE=>You think so, huh?
DRAGLINE=>Where's the egg?
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Man looks like a goddamn bus driver.
GAMBLER=>He gets too close to me and I'll cut his belly open.
KOKO'S VOICE=>Snake in the grass! Boss!
LUKE=>Pickin' it up here, Boss!
LUKE=>Don't forget your walking stick, Boss.
LUKE=>You shore can shoot, man.
DRAGLINE=>Luke, why you actin' so strange? What you wanna do somethin' like that for? You gone too far when you mess with the Man With No Eyes. You gonna be outa here in a little bit -- whyn't you jus' take it a little easy?
LUKE=>Man, it looks like the Big Boss is getting ready to let us have it!
BOSS PAUL=>Awright, you kin git in that truck.
LUKE=>Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
DRAGLINE=>Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
LUKE=>You still believe in the Big Bearded Boss, Drag? You think he's up there watching us?
DRAGLINE=>Get in here! Ain't you scared -- ain't you scared of dyin'?
LUKE=>Dyin'? He can take back this nice pretty life any time He wants. You welcome to it, Old Timer. Come on! Make me know you're up there! Kill me or love me, one or the other.
LUKE=>Standin' out here in the rain! All alone! Talkin' to myself.
DRAGLINE=>Blind Dick is payin' us off three and borrowin' back five. Next!
DRAGLINE=>Borrowin' or payin' back?
TATTOO=>Borrowin'.
DRAGLINE=>Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
SOCIETY RED'S VOICE=>I believe I still owe you thirty. I don't suppose you'd take a check.
TATTOO'S VOICE=>My Navy disability didn't come yet. You know how it is.
LUKE=>Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
DRAGLINE=>Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
CARR=>Sorry, Luke.
SOCIETY RED=>His mother's dead.
CARR'S VOICE=>Fifty, boss.
WICKERMAN'S VOICE=>Fifty, awright, Carr.
BOSS PAUL=>Awright, git lined up here.
CAPTAIN=>Luke, fall out.
CAPTAIN'S VOICE=>When a man's mother dies and he gits to thinkin' about her funeral and payin' respects, before he knows it his mind ain't right and he's got rabbit in his blood and runs. We're keepin' you off the road fer awhile.
BOSS KEAN=>Ah'm jus' doin' mah job, Luke. You gotta appreciate that.
LUKE=>Boss, when you do somethin' to me you better do it because you got to or want to... but not because it's your damn job.
BOSS PAUL'S VOICE=>Awright, let's move it out!
CARR'S VOICE=>First bell! First bell! Let's go!

BOSS PAUL=>Git on your feet! Ah'm gonna teach you some respect right now!
CARR'S VOICE=>Last bell! Last bell! Forty-nine, Boss. And one in the box.
WICKERMAN'S VOICE=>Forty-nine and one in the box. Right, Carr.
CARR'S VOICE=>First bell! First bell! Let's go!
BOSS PAUL=>You look hongry, Luke. Reckon this would taste mighty good, but Rudolph looks pretty hongry, too. Why don't we split it with the pooch, okay?
BOSS PAUL=>Tha's a good boy. Well, here's your piece, Luke.
LUKE=>Might as well give it all to him, Boss. I just ain't much hungry.
BOSS KEAN=>She's in the ground now, Luke. Best forget about it. You got a day ana half lay-in... and tomorrow's a holiday.
ALIBI=>Happy Fourth of July.
SLEEPY=>Same to you.
ALIBI=>Boy, if anyone had told me where I was going to be spending Independence Day...
TATTOO=>Wanda trembled, faced by this awesome decision. It was the moment of choice. Could she take the plunge and wantonly hurl herself into pagan abandon? Or would she remain ever fettered by the bonds of her puritanical upbringing? Could she take this chance to experience the sensual thrill of total release and gratification? Or would she turn her back and retreat into frigid denial? Desire and fear, temptation and terror, yearning and horror, warred within her beautiful young body...
CARR=>First bell! Let's git to bed. You done had your fun.
DRAGLINE=>She moved her head another inch while he reached up and put his left hand on Carol's cheek as Carol pressed her lips to... Oh Lord, I can't read it!
DRAGLINE=>Carr. Lookit this. Oh I don't believe it.
CARR=>What you got there, Drag? You bought yourself another of them dirty books?
DRAGLINE=>Here's a real hot one!
CARR=>Awright, last bell!
WICKER MAN'S VOICE=>HEY, CARR! WHAT'S THAT OUTSIDE?
CARR=>Somebody's on the fence, boss!
BOSS PAUL=>Who else?
CARR=>Jackson. He cut a hole in the floor, Boss.
BOSS PAUL=>He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
DOGBOY=>Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
BOSS PAUL=>Stan' back, Dogboy. Git the leash here.
DOGBOY=>Blue! Come back here! Come back, I said.
DOGBOY=>Listen to Blue sing. She's on to him. She says: got him.
BOSS SHORTY=>Hail, that dog is jus' runnin' in circles.
BOSS PAUL=>Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
DOGBOY=>She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
BOSS PAUL=>It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
DOGBOY=>How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
BOSS HIGGINS=>I'm beat. This ain't mah job, nohow.
BOSS SHORTY=>Me neither.
BOSS PAUL=>Here's the Patrol.
DOGBOY=>She's got him! You hear that?
OFFICER=>Okay, let's get started.
DOGBOY=>Come on, Rudolph, Austin, you no good buncha chicken-eaters, we're lookin' for a man. We got us a job to do.
OFFICER=>Your dogs are crazy.
DOGBOY=>He keeps criss-crossin'. He's smarter'n a dog. But he ain't got us boxed yet... Blue'll get him.
DOGBOY=>Dammit. Blue! Blue!
DOGBOY=>Look, Cap'n. Look what he done to Blue. He's dead, Cap'n. Dead! Run hisself plumb to death. That crazy sadis Cool Hand Luke run her 'til her heart bust.
DRAGLINE=>He made it.
CARR'S VOICE=>Forty-eight, Boss. One in the box and one in the bush.
BOSS PAUL=>Awright, hold it!
CAPTAIN=>You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
LUKE=>Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
CAPTAIN=>Don't you never talk that way to me! You hear? You hear? Never!
CAPTAIN=>What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you can't reach, that is they just don't listen when you talk reasonable so you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it, well he gets it, and I don't like it any better than you men.
DRAGLINE=>Awright, buddy. You be awright. You give 'em a run for their money. Jus' take it slow and easy, baby. You gonna make it fine.
DRAGLINE=>Come on, buddy. Show 'em you're awright.
BOSS KEAN'S VOICE=>Awright, let's eat them beans.
DOGBOY=>I knew they'd git you. With them chains an a bonus of a coupla years, you runnin' days is over forever. Ah'd like to see you try to run agin. You gettin' so you smell so bad, I could track you myself.
LUKE=>For a natural born son of a bitch like you, that oughta be easy.
DRAGLINE=>Jus' take it slow, buddy.
KOKO=>What happened? How far did you get?
DRAGLINE=>Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
TATTOO=>I gotta know -- How... how'd they get you?
LUKE=>Topflight police work.
GAMBLER=>Tell us about it.
BLIND DICK=>You steal a car?
LUKE=>Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
KOKO=>Well, how far didya get?
LUKE=>Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Didya fight it out with him?
LUKE=>Nope. I jus' kept lookin' straight ahead waiting for that light to change. And he kept lookin' over, wondering what somethin' that looked like me was doin' drivin' a shiny new car.
ALIBI=>And then...?
LUKE=>Then he leans over and sees this state issue... All there was to it. Feller's probably a lieutenant by now.
DRAGLINE=>Well now we jus' gonna lay low and build time and afore you know it the heat'll be off you and things be back where they was. Right, sweet buddy?
BOSS KEAN=>Ah hears tell you don't believe in no God, Luke. Ah was wonderin' how come a nice lookin' feller like you come to get put on the Hard Road. But now ah reckons ah knows. Ah been on the Road Gang for twenny-two year, Luke, and in all that time I ain't never killed no white man but I ain't afeerd to cause a body has to do his work. And I ain't never seen no man that wasn't afeerd to die neither.
LUKE=>'Scuse me, Boss. Don't mean to interrupt... but... caught short here.
BOSS KEAN=>Awright, Luke. Thas okay... You go on up there in them trees. Man's gotta have some privacy sometime. But you grab a bush and keep shakin' it, hear? Jes' so we know you're there. Jes' keep shakin' that bush.
LUKE=>Yes, boss.
LUKE=>I'm shakin' it, Boss. I'm shakin' it!
LUKE=>Still shakin' it, Boss.
BOSS KEAN=>Damn!
BOSS KEAN=>He's gone! Git the dogs!
LAWRENCE=>Whattaya got them on for?
BEN=>How do you take your pants off?
LUKE=>Well -- the best way is to take the leg irons off first. But you ain't strong enough.
LAWRENCE=>Strong enough for whut?
LUKE=>You couldn't heft an axe.
LAWRENCE=>Can, too.
LUKE=>What's your name?
BEN=>Ben. Had'n you better take them stripes off your pants?
LUKE=>You wanna see somethin' funny? Go get some chili powder, pepper, curry, dried mustard and like that. A lot of it.
LUKE=>Hold it!
LAWRENCE=>No, me, me. Let me do it!
BEN=>Here's them spices. What's wrong with him?
LUKE=>You remember how them dogs do when they get here so you can tell me about it someday.
DRAGLINE'S VOICE=>Thas the church. After he chopped off those old chains and whilst he was layin'd down the pepper --
GAMBLER'S VOICE=>I heard it was curry powder.
DRAGLINE'S VOICE=>It was pepper and curry powder and dry mustard. Now shut your face. Whilst he was layin' down them spices, Luke heard them choir practicin' in there. So he just sauntered inside, cool's kin be, and sung along with them... my baby Luke... and he was still singin' when the dogs come by, singing and grinning and eatin' the food the people had brung him.
BOSS PAUL'S VOICE=>Awright, let's git to work.
DRAGLINE=>He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
KOKO=>He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>...fried clams, pizza, chocolate, malted milkshakes.
SOCIETY RED=>...and a Brown Bomber.
DRAGLINE=>Shut your mouth. He's out there doin' it for all of us.
CARR=>Magazines for you, Dragline!
DRAGLINE=>Magazines? Who's sendin' me magazines?
DRAGLINE=>From mah uncle? Ah never heard from him in eight years and now he's sendin' me magazines. He musta gone crazy.
DRAGLINE=>Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
KOKO=>I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
DRAGLINE=>What's the writing say?
SOCIETY RED=>Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
DRAGLINE=>Oh my. Oh my... Give it back here!
KOKO=>Lemme see it!
DRAGLINE=>Get away!
KOKO=>Lookit the brunette...
BLIND DICK=>The blonde's gotta better set.
GAMBLER=>Some legs.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>They must be six feet tall.
TATTOO=>...And the champagne.
SOCIETY RED=>Domestic.
TRAMP=>Wonder how he got the dough.
ALIBI=>He's probably a salesman. You can make pretty good money if you know what your doing in selling.
GAMBLER=>A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
BLIND DICK=>He's probably a gigolo.
MECHANIC=>Or a con artist.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>The head of the rackets.
KOKO=>Oh lookit that brunette.
DRAGLINE=>Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
SOCIETY RED=>Stop that.
KOKO=>How about you tryin' to make me?
SOCIETY RED=>Oh for...
KOKO=>Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
DRAGLINE=>What for?
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Yeah, Drag. Get it out for a look.
DRAGLINE=>You're just a kid. Whatta you know about it? You don't wanna see that dirty picture. Luke and those broads an' all that booze.
KOKO=>Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
DRAGLINE=>It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
BLIND DICK=>Dragline! Be a buddy!
DRAGLINE=>How much you figure it's worth, a peek at this here picture? A quick look, I'm not talkin' about no memorizin' job.
KOKO=>A cold drink.
DRAGLINE=>A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
KOKO=>A cold drink? Okay?
DRAGLINE=>Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
CAPTAIN=>You run one time, you got yourself a set of chains. You run twice, you got two sets. You ain't gonna need no third set because you're gonna get your mind right... And I mean right.
CAPTAIN=>Take a good look at your Cool Hand Luke.
DRAGLINE=>Oh mah poor baby. They done you real good... I don't know if you gonna have them gals chasin' after you for a while...
SOCIETY RED'S VOICE=>I've got some aspirin.
KOKO'S VOICE=>They half killed him.
ALIBI'S VOICE=>He should have a doctor.
DRAGLINE'S VOICE=>Don't you never learn nuthin'? They ain't gonna let no doctor see what they dont to him...
DRAGLINE=>Carr, kin we use your razor to clean up where they cut his head?
GAMBLER=>How you feelin', buddy?
TRAMP=>He don't hear.
TATTOO=>Somebody get him something to drink.
SOCIETY RED=>Here.
DRAGLINE=>That's my baby.
KOKO=>He's gonna be awright.

GAMBLER=>We saw the broads.
BLIND DICK=>Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
LUKE=>It's a phoney. Made it up just for you guys.
LOUDMOUTH STEVE=>Aw, come on. We saw it all.
TATTOO=>The champagne.
TRAMP=>Some life.
FIXER=>You really had it made.
LUKE=>Nothin. I had nothin, made nothin. Couple towns, couple bosses. Laughed out loud one day and got turned in.
KOKO=>But -- but --
LUKE=>That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
DRAGLINE=>He ain't himself. He's all beat up. Cain't you see that? He don't know what he sayin'.
BOSS PAUL=>You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
LUKE=>Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
BOSS PAUL=>Gonna learn you not to back sass!
SOCIETY RED=>He'll never make it.
KOKO=>What are you talking about?
SOCIETY RED=>He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
KOKO=>Give in? That's our Luke out there.
DRAGLINE=>That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
SOCIETY RED=>Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
KOKO=>I don't see no sign of guts in you.
SOCIETY RED=>No. No chains either.
KOKO=>You ain't man enough to wear them!
SOCIETY RED=>But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
KOKO=>Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
SOCIETY RED=>You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
KOKO=>You phony creep!
DRAGLINE=>Awright, that's enough. You wanna end up in the box, too?
CARR'S VOICE=>First bell! First bell!
DOGBOY=>Here's our champeen hog gut. Ain't et for four days, gonna need a little extra... Well we got plenty for you...
DOGBOY=>Now you know the rules... gotta eat everything on the plate or go back in the box, right, Boss?
JABO=>We ain't got but one pot of stew, you know. He ain't the only one eatin'.
DOGBOY=>Man use to Free World food gotta big appetite... so here's some more potatoes and here's some ice cream and some cake with choclat fudge sauce... there you go, stretch that hog-belly right out.

LUKE=>Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
DRAGLINE=>And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
LUKE=>Yeah, well... I never planned nothin' in my life...

LUKE=>I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
DRAGLINE=>But, Luke...
LUKE=>Take it easy, Drag.
DRAGLINE=>Luke. Where you goin?
LUKE=>On my own.
DRAGLINE=>But what am I gonna do all by myself? Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
DRAGLINE=>Luke? Just the same, you're a good old boy, Luke. You take care, hear?
LUKE=>Hey, Old Man! You home tonight?
LUKE=>If you kin spare a minute, it's about time we had ourselves a little talk.
LUKE=>Old Man, I know I'm a pretty evil feller who killed people in the war and got drunk and chopped up municipal merchandise and like that. I admit ain't got no call to ask for much. But even so, you ain't dealt me no cards in a long time. I mean it's beginning to look like you got it fixed so I can't never win out. Inside or out, it's just different bosses and different rules. Where am I supposed to fit in? Old Man, I got to tell you: I started out pretty strong and fast but it's starting to get to me... When does it end?... What you got in mind for me next? Old Man. What do I do now? Awright. On my hands and knees a skin'. Yeah. That's what I thought. I guess I'm just a hardcase and I gotta find my way out myself.
LUKE=>Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
DRAGLINE=>Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
LUKE=>Do we even get our same bunks back?
DRAGLINE=>Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
LUKE=>You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
DRAGLINE=>Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
LUKE=>Like I always do?
DRAGLINE=>Thass right. Just play it...
DRAGLINE=>Luke, what are do doin'?
LUKE=>WHAT WE GOT HERE IS A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE...
DRAGLINE=>Luke!
SHERIFF=>You follow me and I'll radio the emergency clinic to open up...
CAPTAIN=>I'm takin' him to the prison hospital.
SHERIFF=>But that's an hour away. He ain't gonna last twenty minutes.
CAPTAIN=>Git outa the way. He's ours.
