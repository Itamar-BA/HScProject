VILJAR=>Hi, er.. Viljar Hanssen...
MOTHER UTØYA=>But it’s also an opportunity to think about your future. You grow up so fast, and one day it will be you who will be the leader of your community. Viljar, can you start?
VILJAR=>Was it Al-Qaida?

DETECTIVE ANDERSON=>Did anyone help you with it?
DETECTIVE ANDERSON=>We need to know if there are anymore attacks planned.

VIBEKE DEF. LAWYER=>It was a very dysfunctional family. Breivik’s parents split acrimoniously when he was very young.
LIPPESTAD=>Was he ever violent?
PRIME MINISTER=>This public inquiry is of vital importance. Whatever went wrong we must confront it. If we fail to do so, the terrorist will surely win.

LARA’S VOICE=>I’ve worried about you.
INGA=>What happened?
LIPPESTAD=>He was the only one.
LARA=>And I-sorry...
