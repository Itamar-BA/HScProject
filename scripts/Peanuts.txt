LINUS=>Ah! My blanket!
FRANKLIN=>Only Charlie Brown.
FRIEDA=>Watch the curls!
CHARLIE BROWN=>My pitching has to improve if I come out here to my trusty mound every day.
MARCIE=>You’re hurting me, sir.
SCHROEDER=>Wow, she’s pretty.
LITTLE KID=>What are you in for?
CHARLIE BROWN=>Because I just came down with a serious case of inadequacy.
CHARLIE BROWN=>Yup. If there is one person you want by your side at a moment like this, it’s your loyal dog.
CHARLIE BROWN=>Let’s just say there’s this girl I’d like to impress. But she’s something and I’m nothing.
CHARLIE BROWN=>If I were something and she was nothing I could talk to her or if she was nothing and I was nothing I could talk to her. But she’s something and I’m nothing, so I just can’t talk to her.
CHARLIE BROWN=>Forget everything you ever knew about yourself. Hm. Okay.
CHARLIE BROWN=>Step two. Project confidence!
LUCY=>Oh Schroeder...
CHARLIE BROWN=>Oh, brother. She’s talking to them?! So much for a fresh start.
CHARLIE BROWN=>I gotta get out there.
FRIEDA=>Charlie Brown?
PATTY=>Do I know you?
PATTY=>Yes, alright!
MISS OTHMAR=>Waa Wa Waaa.
CHARLIE BROWN=>Yikes! How long was this war?
CHARLIE BROWN=>First there was war. Then there was peace.
CHARLIE BROWN=>This is no use. I’m just not as smart as they think I am.
CHARLIE BROWN=>There’s still time. You can do this. You can’t give up on her now!
CHARLIE BROWN=>Was she feeling sorry for me? I don’t want her to choose me just because she was feeling sorry for me. I have slightly more dignity than that.
CHARLIE BROWN=>But it’s about to leave.
CHARLIE BROWN=>You remembered my name?
