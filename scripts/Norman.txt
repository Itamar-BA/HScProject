KAVISH .=>We follow Bill, FROM NORMAN’S POV, as he finishes his run and stops by a tree to stretch his muscles. We focus in on Bill’s energized face as we continue to hear:
NORMAN=>I got a meeting!
TITLE: NORMAN=>THE MODERATE RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF A NEW YORK FIXER
OPPENHEIMER=>He wanders into a medium size auditorium in the middle of a panel discussion, quietly finding a seat in the back of the room. THE ROOM IS FULL OF BANKERS AND FINANCE EXECUTIVES. From a distance Norman blends in, but a closer look at how he is dressed, exposes that he clearly does not belong. On stage, with a backdrop of images of massive oil drilling rigs, there is a MODERATOR and a GUEST SPEAKER-- RON MAOR a minister in the Israeli Parliament. They are discussing geopolitics and the energy market, but our focus is Norman’s POV, scanning the room. He is hunting for something, focusing on different individuals, men and women, their name-tags, their laptops, gadgets, briefcases, shoes, different items that catch his attention. While in the B.G.--
MICHA ESHEL.=>He is in his mid 40s, handsome, well dressed. He is sitting in the front row near the door, with an expression that is saying that he has heard all this before and that he is not very impressed with Mr. Maor on stage.
NORMAN=>What about you? Would you ever consider running?
ESHEL=>Only magicians can do two things at the same time... So what do you say?
ESHEL=>Yeah? You sure?
ARTHUR=>Mr. Oppenheimer? NORMAN
ESHEL=>Yeah? You sure?
PHILIP=>If you don’t go up to him, he won’t know you’re here.
PHILIP=>Everything okay? NORMAN
ESHEL=>You know Norman, right?
ESHEL=>Naomi. Come meet Norman Oppenheimer. Norman, this is my wife Naomi.
ESHEL=>Yes. Of course. Look around you. Look around...
WITHIN THE FREEZE:=>On Norman: looking around him - he sees a forest of human encounters frozen in time. Just as great composers create perfect harmonies in their mind, as world-class chess players can plan 50 moves ahead - so Norman’s genius comes into play in this room, at this moment. He sees how it all connects! Norman examines the different frozen interactions. --He sees Arthur Taub. He examines his cocky face without any spite or resentment, only a satisfied smile that says - I have arrived! He also sees Arthur’s assistant. --Then he looks over at BILL KAVISH, standing next to JO WILF. Bill has a strained smile and drops of sweat on his forehead.
AFFILIATION IN STACCATO.=>Each introducing the next. All from Norman’s POV, realistic and gritty, in dizzying collage of faces, names and accents.
JO WILF=>How close is close? Close close? Or “close”?
JO WILF=>
ALEX=>I represent one of the organizations.
ESHEL=>This evening I had to... Duby, how do you say mas sefataim?
ALEX=>We coordinate criminal investigations, judicial procedure, extradition.
ALEX=>Yes, that too.
NORMAN=>What do you mean?
NORMAN=>They should be.
ALEX=>Sorry to hear that. You raised your daughter alone?
ALEX=>What do you mean you bought him a pair of shoes?
DAY=>On one side of the frame we see JO WILF, in his GRAND MIDTOWN
OFFICE.=>On the other side of the frame we see NORMAN in a STAPLES STORE, speaking on his cell phone.
DUBY=>I don’t care. Norman does not get passed you. No matter what he says. If he becomes obsessive, you can take a call from him once every few days so that he doesn't get paranoid, and to keep the connection alive, but never, never put him through. Understood? Never.
ISRAEL=>Hanna’s phone is blinking. It is Norman. Hanna takes a deep breath then focuses her attention on Eshel and a Chinese official as they applaud the end of an ISRAELI FOLK DANCE NUMBER performed by a CHILDREN'S DANCE GROUP.
DAY=>Norman is by the dressing rooms, whispering into his phone.
ISRAEL=>Hanna is walking up to her apartment in the middle of the night, carrying a LARGE BOX FULL OF CHINESE SOUVENIRS AND OFFICIAL GIFTS. She is tired and humorless.
NORMAN=>Thank you, Philip. You’ll have your Rabbi tomorrow. PHILIP
PRIVATE CELL”=>Norman deliberates for a brief moment, then, impulsively, presses CALL. He holds his breath while he waits.
FEMALE BOARD MEMBER=>A letter of intent. You need a letter.
NORMAN=>Philip. It’s your uncle Norman. You’re all set. Call Rabbi Blumenthal. He’s expecting your call.
INTERPRETER=>Valery Spektor, head of the general agency for legal protection of Military, special and dual-use intellectual property at the ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation.
ESHEL=>But you went along with it... We took the favor. NAOMI
A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE=>“Unnamed New York businessman is central figure in an investigation into payments made to Israel's prime minister” With a picture of Eshel, and Duby on the edge of the frame whispering something in the prime minister’s ear.
STINKS”=>And a caricature of Eshel as a PROUD PEACOCK on top of a pile of rotten EGGS.
ALEX=>I don’t know.
NORMAN=>It is bad for everybody, that’s why I want to help... PHILIP
RON MAOR.=>We focus on Eshel's face, on Duby’s face, on Hanna’s face, as they are forced to hear sentences like:
NORMAN.=>She shows it to Duby, who is standing next to her by the side door to the parliament hall. Duby shakes his head.
HANNA=>Busy as usual.
TRUFFLES.=>Then the focus changes - reflected in the shop window, Norman notices the THE SHTETL MAN standing across the street. He realizes that this man has been following him around since he first saw him through the Starbucks window. After a pause.
RON MAOR=>Giving in to our enemy's every last demand is not peace!! It’s called LOSING!
DUBY=>Just call him.
NORMAN=>What do I need??
NORMAN=>No. That’s okay.
SECURITY GUARD’S VOICE=>Please shut it off and put it in the tray as well. NORMAN
ALEX’S VOICE=>Everybody seems to know who you are. But nobody knows anything about you. Even people who say they have known you for years.
DIRECTLY A HIM.=>We see Norman, in a panic, clutch his EPIPEN.
DUBY=>Norman Oppenheimer is a threat to our national interests. You need to treat him like you would any other threat. This is not your choice. It is your duty.
RABBI BLUMENTHAL=>I should have known. I should have known not to trust you. I should have known. It’s my fault. What do I do now??
PRIVATE CELL=>Norman takes a deep breath.
BILL=>No, you don’t. Whatever it is, it is too small.
NORMAN=>But it’s your job to listen to me anyway, isn’t it?
