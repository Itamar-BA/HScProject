BANQUO=>That trusted home Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, Besides the Thane of Cawdor.
DUNCAN=>My worthy Cawdor.
MACBETH=>My dearest love, Duncan comes here to-night.
MACBETH=>He’s here in double trust: First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed; then as his host, Who should against his Murderer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Would plead like angels, trumpet-tongu’d, against The deep damnation of his taking-off.
MACBETH=>If we should fail?
MACBETH=>Come, let me clutch thee -
MACBETH=>There’s no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes.

LADY MACBETH=>To bed. To bed. To bed.
VOICE=>Turn, Hell-hound, turn!
