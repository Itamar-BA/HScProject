SCOTT=>I never thought I could be a real model, you know fashion-shit, cause I'm better at full body stuff It.8 okay so long as the photographer doesn't come on to you and expect something for no pay I'm trying to make a living, you know, and I like to be professional 'Course if the guy wants to pay me, then shit/yeah. Here I am for him. I'll sell my ass, I do it on the street all the time for cash. And I'll be on the cover of a book. It's when you start doing it for free that you start to grow wings, Right, Mike?
MIKE=>What are you talking about? What wings?
SCOTT=>Wings, man, you grow Wings and become a FAIRY
MIKE=>I ain't no fairy.
COVERBOY=>He ain't saying you is a fairy; faggot, he's saying that if you go working for free then you has no choice, you turn into a fairy, with wings and all. That's all he mean, dunk.
COVERBOY=>Is that right, sweetie?
SCOTT=>Actually, I'm on the street to settle a bet with my goddamned stone-faced old man. I've decided to live away from home for three years. To prove a point. That I can live on my own. And to appreciate the value of a dollar. And Mike is right, there, I am going to inherit money. A lot of money
MIKE=>You can always tell where you are by the way the road looks. Like I Just know that I been to this place before. I Just know that I been stuck here like this one fuckin' time before, you know that?
MIKE=>There ain't no other road on earth that looks like this road. I mean, exactly like this road. One of a kind. Like someone's face. Like a fucked up face...
MIKE=>Once you see it, even for a second, you remember it, and you better not forget it, you gotta remember people and who they are, right? Friends and enemies. You gotta remember the road and where it is too...
MIKE=>I Just love to scare things... I don't know. It gives me a sense of.... Power.
MIKE=>This is nowhere. I'll bet that nobody is ever going to drive down this road. I'll be stuck here forever.
MIKE'S VOICE OVER=>I don't know when it was I recognized I had this disease.
MIKE'S VOICE OVER=>Sometimes I'll be in one place, and I'll close my eyes...
MIKE'S VOICE OVER=>When I open them again, I'll be in a completely different surrounding.
SUBTITLES=>It's kind of like time travel. It's kind of good.
MIKE=>Yeah. It's kind of good. Passes the time. Unwanted as it is.
SCOTT=>Man, what do you want from us, we haven't got anything.
RAY=>What's up?
GARY=>What's this guy want, think he wants to party?
SCOTT=>He said "Entschuldiging, Junge."
GARY=>What's that mean? "Suck my dick?" Does he want to suck my dick?
SCOTT=>It means, "Excuse me, boys."
GARY=>How the fuck do you know.
SCOTT=>I've studied German, in prep school.
GARY=>You know, Scottie, I don't know when to believe you.
SCOTT=>Here he comes again.
MAN=>HELLO?
GARY=>Hey, dude.
MAN=>Excuse me. Can I speak to the young man over there, with the blond hair, ya?
GARY=>Who, that kid there? You can't talk with him now, he's asleep.
MAN=>Can you wake him up?
GARY=>No, you can't wake him... he...... but, what about me? Don't you want to talk with me?
SCOTT=>Was willist du in Gottesname mit uns Juenge? Mach' es flar oder fanre ab!
MAN=>Du bisst sehr intelligent mit deinem Aksent.. Fuer elnen Puppejunge.
GARY=>Alright then, asshole!
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>The first time I met Scott, I had a feeling he was a sort of comic book hero. He was always saying the right thing at the right moment, and standing up for me when there was no reason to. Look at his face now, when the sunlight shines off his lower lip, like it is the face of some sort of statue. Strong and soft at the same time. I never could figure out what Scott was doing here with us on the street in the first place, like he was on some sort of crusade, to help the poor. Because he really did come from a rich Portland family. I know because he brought me to his house one day and showed me around. I mean, wow, they were rich I They even had a swimming pool. Scott's the only kid that I had ever met that had a swimming pool. I'd make a bet with anybody right now, that Scott is a saint or a hero, or some such higher placed person.
RAY=>My father was a gaucho. But nobody gonna find him. He killed a guy and split. Nobody gonna find that fuck. I never gonna find him.
NURSE=>Excuse me. Are you all right?
MIKE=>Yeah. I'm fine.
MIKE=>Oh. Yeah. Do you live here?
NURSE=>Why... no. But sometimes I feel like I do.
MIKE=>What's this?
MIKE=>This chick is living in a new car ad.
MIKE=>This is like a dream. A pretty woman never picks me up.
LADY=>They Don't? Well. I Don't see why not...
MIKE=>Is this your house?
MIKE=>What's up, Gary? Scottie?
GARY=>HEY, DUDE.
LADY=>You men make yourselves comfortable, and I'll be right back. There're cokes in the refrigerator - help yourself.
SCOTTIE=>She's cool. She Just likes to have three guys, 'cause - it takes her a little while to get warmed up. It's normal. Nothing kinky.
MIKE=>Oh.
GARY=>Hey, did you get into that Van Halen concert last night?
MIKE=>I've never been to a concert, dude.
SCOTT=>He always does this! I'm surprised he makes money at all.
GARY=>How do we tell if he's okay?
SCOTT=>Well, he's not dead.
SCOTT=>Listen.
SCOTT=>He's not dead. He's Just passed out. It's a condition. It's called narcolepsy.
GARY=>Scared the shit out of her. What causes it. Sex?
SCOTT=>Stress. Some hustler, huh?
GARY=>Where are we going to take him?
SCOTT=>Hey, little brother. You stay here, and when you wake up, Just come back into town. I'll be there waiting for you. I figure you're going to be safer here in this comfy neighborhood than in the city. I grew up in a neighborhood like this. It'll be safe here.
MIKE=>Hi.
HANS=>Say....
HANS=>Say, Bill. What's happening?
MIKE=>Nothing much.
HANS=>Do you want a lift? Bill?
MIKE=>Hey, isn't this the lady's car?
HANS=>Is Alena a friend of yours? She's a friend of mine. Any friend of Alena's is a friend of mine. Do you want to be my friend?
MIKE=>Not really.
HANS=>Get in and I'll take you someplace. Yes? Where do you want to go?
MIKE=>This guy is a pervert. I can tell.
MIKE=>Go home!
MIKE=>How'd we get home?
SCOTT=>That German guy. Hans. He brought you downtown, you were passed out. He said he was heading to Portland, so I asked him for a ride.
MIKE=>I don't remember any German guy.
SCOTT=>Well. You were sleeping.
MIKE=>How much do you make off me while I'm sleeping?
SCOTT=>Just a ride, Mike. I don't make anything. What, you think that I sell your body while you are asleep.
MIKE=>Yeah.
SCOTT=>No, Mike. I'm on your side.
MIKE=>I was Just kidding, dude.
SCOTT=>Gary's up here somewhere. He left three days ago, he flew up with some John.
MIKE=>Exotic. Have you seen your dad?
SCOTT=>Are you kidding?
MIKE=>I'd visit my dad, if he was here.
SCOTT=>I have to take care of you.
MIKE=>How about your mom?
SCOTT=>No.
MIKE=>That lady. She looked like. My mother.
SCOTT=>Is that why you passed out?
MIKE=>Yeah. I mean. I don't know. She really looked like my mother. I must have been imagining things.
SCOTT=>HEY' You dick!
MIKE'S THOUGHTS:=>It was almost as if Scott was on some sort of crusade or mission, when you checked him out. He could make you feel good right at the very time that you felt so bad. I remember there were many times that I had been sobbing in Scott's arms and he was helping me out too. He was the great protector of us all, and the great planner. He gave us hope in the future. Even though there was no future. There must have been real trouble at home, though, for Scott not to want to visit his father.
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>That's Carl. He's always around the Broadway, he didn't run away from home like a lot of these kids did. He had a mom, and no dad, at least they didn't know where he was. And one day, he came home to the apartment where they lived, and there was no mom anymore either. He didn't know where she went. That was sir months ago.
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>That's Mary over there. She was a mean old chick. She was maybe thirty now. Old, old. Somebody once told me that in the past, Mary had this enemy, a chick that had turned her in. And Mary had gone off and kicked this chick to death right in the street in front of everybody. I don't know if it's true, but I watched out, Just in case. I was afraid of Mary. And everyone else was too.
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>This was our little round table, a point around which everything else revolved. It was our "center." It was like our home. Our living room. Not everyone was the best of friends, but everyone knew everyone else, and we kind of stuck together.
MIKE=>Hey Marty. What's goin' on?
MARTY=>Is that you Mike? Hey, what's new with you? You look pretty good.
MIKE=>How many you got so far today?
MARTY=>I reckon that I picked up about twenty-three bucks so far with these cans, and some I got stashed back in the bushes. You know the old hiding place?
MIKE=>Wow!
MARTY=>Don't tell anybody, though. Just between you and me. You need a place to stay?
MIKE=>I always need a place to stay, dude.
MARTY=>Yeah, well, I'm under the bridge. You can Join me if you like.
MIKE=>Yeah, I think I'll rooftop it tonight. I'm hanging with a friend.
MARTY=>Am I walking too fast for you?
MIKE=>Hey - what's up?
BUDD=>Jesus. ..the things we've seen... do you remember a thing since we moved from graffiti bridge?
BOB=>No more of that, Budd.
BUDD=>Ha-ha, what a crazy night.
GARY=>Hey, Scottie, here comes that fat pig himself!!! He owes me money!
SCOTT=>Who?
GARY=>Look out, it's raining Coke!
BOB=>Ah, I think my friends can see I am back from Boise.
BOB=>Do you see any clouds in the sky, Budd?
BUDD=>No, Bob.
BUDD=>Is Jane Lightwork alive, Bob?
BOB=>She's alive, Budd.
BUDD=>Is she holding on?
BOB=>Old... old, Budd.
BUDD=>She must be old, she has no choice...
BUDD=>I remember her daughter, she died years ago... of old age. She must be old, all right. That was before I came to Clements Inn.
BOB=>Ahh...
BUDD=>That we have, that we have... in fact Bob, we have. Jesus... the things that we've seen.
SCOTTIE=>Where's Bob?
A BOY=>Fast asleep.
BUDD=>And he's snoring like a horse.
MIKE=>I picked his pocket.
SCOTTIE=>What do you care?
SCOTTIE=>Why, you wouldn't even look at a clock, unless hours were lines of coke, dials looked like the signs of gay bars, or time itself was a fair hustler in black leather... isn't that right, dude?
SCOTT=>There's no reason to know the time. We are timeless.
BOB=>Aren't you forgetting, Scottie my boy, [A GOVERNOR'S SON], that we who steal, do so at midnight?
BOB=>What the...who ripped me off? Budd!!! Budd!!!
BUDD=>Yes, Bob!!!
BOB=>I fell asleep and have been robbed!
JANE=>You'd think that I could keep the peace in my house...
JANE=>Bob, Bob we'll find your drugs. We'll find them.
BOB=>Jane, I know you well enough...
JANE=>I know you, ~ you owe me money, Bob, and now you pick a fight with me, and are disturbing the peace of my hotel.
BOB=>This hotel is full of thieves... Junkies!
JANE=>You are the thief!
BOB=>They picked my pocket!
JANE=>It's impossible to board a dozen or so men and women who live honestly and have the others live like Junkies.
BOB=>You have corrupted me, Scottie, I was an innocent before I met you. ..and now look at me.. just a little better than wicked. I used to be a virtuous man...
BOB=>'''well, virtuous enough. I swore a little. I never gambled more than seven times a week. Poker. I never picked up a street boy more than once a quarter...
BOB=>... of an hour. Bad company has corrupted me. I'll be darned if I haven't forgotten what the inside of a church looks like.
MIKE=>Where do you find your strike tonight, Bob?
SCOTTIE=>I see a good change for Bob to make. From Stealing to Preaching.
BOB=>Stealing is my vocation, Scott. It's not a sin for a man to labor at his vocation.
GARY=>Hey... .......
GARY=>Very early tomorrow morning, there will be small time rock and roll promoters coming back from their show. Every night, they walk home with the loot and they stop by the Grotto Bar, one mile away from here, and more often than not they've been drinking already. If we can't steal from them on their way to the bar, we can get them when they come out. See, dude?
MIKE=>I'm not gonna rob anybody. I'd rather sell my ass. Straight and simple. It's less risky.
BOB=>So long as I don't know these guys personally. ..it's okay with me.
GARY=>They're from Beaverton. New to the business...
MIKE=>Not me. I'm not going along on this crackpot scheme. Especially since Gary thought it up.
BOB=>Come oft it, Mikey. Find a better way to make a buck. Something to fall back on, other than your ass.
MIKE=>Scott's inheritance.
SCOTT=>Come along, Mikey. I have a joke I wanna play... a joke I can't pull off alone...
BOB=>Oh, my sweetheart, come and rob with us tomorrow.
MIKE=>I was going to come anyway.
MIKE=>We'll be rich!!!
SCOTT=>Provide for us, oh great psychedelic Papa!
SCOTT=>Good catch dude. ..and meet me on three street!
BOB=>Scott. When you inherit your fortune, on your twenty-first birthday, let's see. ..how far away is this?
SCOTT=>One week away, Bob, just one more week.
BOB=>Let's not call ourselves robbers, but Diannah's foresters. Gentlemen of the shade. Minions of the Moon. Men of good government.
SCOTT=>When I turn twenty-one, I don't want any more of this life. My mother and father will be surprised at the incredible change. It will impress them more when such a fuck up like me turns good than if I had been a good son all along. All the past years I will think of as one big vacation. At least it wasn't as boring as schoolwork. All my bad behavior I'm going to throw away to pay my debt. I will change when everybody expects it the least.
BOB=>And you will become a hard roller, a hatchet man for your old man.
SCOTT=>No! You will be the hatchet man, Bob, that will be your job, and so there will rarely be a job hatcheted. It will be one big endless party, won't it?
BOB=>Well, at least my little friend has offered me a job. They are so good to me.
DENISE=>Moms are great, because, you know, I could always go to my mom and say, hey I need a new lipstick, and she would always give me money for that. That was great.
MIKE=>I only saw my mom once, but I remember what she looked like. She was very beautiful.
DENISE=>What do you mean, once?
MIKE=>When I was born.
DENISE=>How could you remember when that god-awful thing happened?
MIKE=>Dunno. But I remember it. how beautiful and kind she good. Yeah, I remember was. She was good
DENISE=>And she split from you, huh?
MIKE=>Maybe she didn't mean to.
DENISE=>Did you see what was going on, Mike? Between Pinky and Dale? Did you see that? That's the third fight I've seen today. Things always happen in threes.
MIKE=>I don't know. They have a sort of, ah, relationship. Between them.
MIKE=>I don't know about that, but, ah, listen, what you and me talk about, it's just between us, you understand? Hey, what's over there, see those assholes? Who are they, you know any of them?
DENISE=>I can't see that far
DENISE=>HEY!
DENISE=>That reminds me, I gotta send my Ma a Christmas card, I still haven't done it yet.
MIKE=>Yeah, I haven't done it either.
DENISE=>Your mom lives in Idaho right now?
MIKE=>Yeah.
DENISE=>I used to live in Montana.
MIKE=>My own cousin. He's dead. that's one...two... And my grandma, it usually comes in threes.
DENISE=>Does come in threes.
MIKE=>My cousin died, my grandmother died, and right after she died, her daughter died. My aunt. Within a year. And they wuz all women, not even a year, six...well.... six months-eight months, three women in the family died.
MIKE=>That's funny, huh? I WONDER WHY YOU THOUGHT THAT, cuz, my FATHER says stuff like that.
DENISE=>Well, my grandma was superstitious.
MIKE=>My father told me that, said things usually come in threes... and I said, .... you're crazy.
MIKE=>It sounds crazy. That's my lucky number too.
DENISE=>Huh?
MIKE=>Three.
DENISE=>Mine's eight.
MIKE=>I like three.
DENISE=>You know why I like eight?
MIKE=>Why?
DENISE=>Cause of the eight ball. You know. When you're stuck behind the eight ball? I fuckin' feel stuck behind the eight ball today, I'll tell
SCOTT=>How long has it been, Bob, since you could see your own feet?
BOB=>About four years, Scottie. Four years of grief. It blows a man up like a balloon.
MIKE=>There's rock and roll money walking this way!
BUDD=>And they're drunk as skunks.
MIKE=>This is going to be easy. We can do it lying down.
SCOTT=>But don't fall asleep, now, Mike.
BUDD=>Shh! Here they come!
SCOTT=>You four should head them off there!
BOB=>We four? How many are walking with them?
MIKE=>About six.
BOB=>Huh, shouldn't they be robbing us?
SCOTTIE=>If they escape from you, we'll get them here.
BOB=>Eight feet of cobblestones is like 30 yards of flat road with me.
BOB=>I can't see a damned thing in here.
BUDD=>Jesus, will you shut up! And keep on your toes!
BUDD=>Lie down!!
BOB=>Lie down!?
BUDD=>Lie down and stay quiet, until they round the corner and we'll ambush them.
BOB=>Have you got a crane to lift me up again?
MIKE=>They're coming!!
BOB=>Aha! One move and I'll blow you away, you sully scumbags, up against that wall!
BOB=>No! Let him go!
BOB=>Look at him go!
BOB=>The valise is open. Let's see what we got.
SCOTTIE=>Where are our disguises?
BOB=>Ticket anyone? To next week's show?
BOB=>Scott and Mike have disappeared, did the shots scare them away?
BOB=>...maybe we should get the hell out of here. But, are they such chickens?
BOB=>Get the box! Oh, Fuck!
SCOTTIE=>The thieves scatter!
MIKE=>Bob Pigeon will sweat to death!
JACK=>Can anyone tell me about my son?
JACK=>It's been a full three months since I last saw him. Where is my son Scott?
AID=>We don't know, sir.
JACK=>Ask around in Old Town, in some of the taverns there. Some say he frequently is seen down there drinking with street denizens. Some who they say even rob our citizens and store owners. I can't believe that such an effeminate boy supports such 'friends.'
SCOTT=>Mikey, do you realize how long I have been here out on the streets, on this crusade?
MIKE=>About as long as the rest of us. I mean. I can't even remember that far back, Scott, I mean
SCOTT=>It's been three years, Mike.
MIKE=>Wow... that's a really long time, Scott. Have I been here three years, too?
SCOTT=>What I'm getting at, Mike, is that we are survivors.
MIKE=>Yeah, well, so, isn't that obvious?
SCOTT=>Yes. It is incredibly obvious. They could drop a bomb on this city and you know what we would do?
MIKE=>DIE?
SCOTT=>No. We would survive. Because we are...
MIKE=>Survivors!
SCOTT=>Right, Mike.
MIKE=>Say, Scott. Whaddya say we go survive over at the Broadway Cafe a little bit, at least it's warm over there.
DENISE=>MIKE! Scottie! There's a man from City Hall down the street. He wants to speak with you, Scottie.
SCOTT=>What's that?
DENISE=>He says that he's sent by your father.
SCOTT=>Say hello and send him to my mother.
MIKE=>What kind of a man is it?
DENISE=>A young man. And he's got cops with him.
SCOTT=>Cops....
NANCY=>Good morning, officers...
NANCY=>I do believe he was here just a second ago. Nancy looks in the front window.
NANCY=>Oh, yeah, there he is.
SCOTT=>Ah-ha... what have we here?
OFFICIAL=>Excuse me... Mr. Favor... we have been sent in search of a fat man... a large bearded....
SCOTT=>Bob Pigeon?
SCOTT=>What do you want with him?
SCOTT=>I saw him around last night, when was the holdup?
SCOTT=>I saw him about four, but he wasn't very loose with his wallet. Did he get away with any of the money?
SCOTT=>Well, anyway, I haven't seen him recently. Why do you look here?
OFFICIAL=>Sorry for the interruption. We have a message for you from your father. He says that he would like to see you as soon as possible.
MIKE=>Bob is a wanted man now.
SCOTTIE=>And as dangerous to be around as cops themselves.
MIKE=>We need a hiding place.
SCOTTIE=>Where should we go?
MIKE=>To visit my brother.
SCOTT=>You have a brother?
MIKE=>Yes, I have one.
SCOTT=>Where is he?
MIKE=>He's in he's in
MIKE=>Come on...
SCOTT=>Shut up, Mike.
SCOTT=>If I had known that it was going to be this hard to start, then I wouldn't have stopped it at all.
MIKE=>Scott? I just know that I have been on this road before.
MIKE=>It sure is lonely out in the desert.
SCOTT=>Yeah, I guess.
MIKE=>If I had had a normal family, and a good upbringing, then I would have been a well adjusted person. But somehow that just didn't work out.
SCOTT=>Depends on what you'd call "normal. -
MIKE=>Well, normal, you know, with a mom and a dad and a dog and shit like that... normal.
SCOTT=>So you didn't have a dog? Or you didn't have a dad...
MIKE=>I didn't have a dog and I didn't have a dad. Well, not a normal dad...
MIKE=>Hey Scott?
SCOTT=>What?
SCOTT=>What, Mike?
MIKE=>Oh. Have you ever. Uh...
MIKE=>I mean, don't you ever get horny?
SCOTT=>Yeah. But...
MIKE=>Oh, yeah... not for a guy.
SCOTT=>Mike. Two guys can't love each other. They can only be friends.
SCOTT=>I only have sex for money.
SCOTT=>I can't take your money.
SCOTT=>But we can be close friends.
MIKE=>Scott, look...
SCOTT=>Looks like this is it.
MIKE=>Yeah.
SCOTT=>Can't get the bike started. Cops are coming. Stuck in the middle of nowhere with a stolen bike. Yeah, Mike. Looks like this is the end.
COP=>What's the matter with him?
SCOTT=>I don't know. I guess he doesn't like cops.
COP=>Yeah.
SCOTT=>That's how it looks.
COP=>What are you kids doing out here?
SCOTT=>This cycle is one bitch to turn over. But you probably don't know about motorcycles. You aren't a motorcycle cop.
COP=>I turned a few.
SCOTT=>Wake up, Mikey, the heat's off.
SCOTT=>Look, Mike. Sandwiches.
BROTHER=>Your mother... now she was a right woman. She used to be so proud of you... you know... she would just beam. And not Jim Beam either. If you know what I mean. We used to drive for hours to get a look at you. I remember, what was it... eighteen years ago?
MIKE=>Twenty-one.
BROTHER=>Is that how old you are now? I thought you wuz younger than that... what? Well anyway, we would start off in the morning to see you, and it would take an hour to get to the institution. You were maybe one year old. What? I wasn't proud that you had to live in an institution, mind you... but all the same, when I would look at you, all the institutional walls would come down and we were a family. Your mom, me, and you. God knows where dad was.
BROTHER=>Well... Anyway. You were maybe not in the biological sense, my brother, but in our business, ~..... And If I'm not Your brother, how's come you turned out exactly like me then?
BROTHER=>Oh, he'll come out or it. It's like this whenever we get together It's always like this when we get together It's the way that we say hello to each other.
BROTHER=>I'm all that he's got. But he doesn't want me. He doesn't care. He'd rather live out on the streets. I love him, though.
BROTHER=>Oh. I paint these for a living. But sometimes the people don't send the check when they get finished. So I keep them. I like them.
BROTHER=>Want me to tell you what happened to your Mom? Have you ever heard it? Did you ever hear what the hell happened to her?
MIKE=>No. But I don't care.
BROTHER=>You loved her, and don't tell know you did. me you didn't. I
MIKE=>I didn't even know her.
BROTHER=>Yeah, you loved her, though.
MIKE=>I already heard what happened to her.
BROTHER=>But you don't know the whole story. One thing about the truth. It's interesting.
MIKE=>I don't care.
BROTHER=>If you had known her, you would care. She would see guys on the side. At night. When I wouldn't be around... maybe I'd be in San Francisco or some darned place, doing my own business. God knows where. She would see guys... yeah.... anyway along comes this guy. A guy we both knew. A guy who was into cards. A gamblin' man. And he said that he used to herd cattle in Argentina. I dunno, maybe he did, and he had a bit of money. More'n I had at that point in time. But it was funny, the way he gambled. He was not safe in the friends that he made. So his money would come and go real fast....
MIKE=>I never heard this one before.
BROTHER=>So this guy, your Mom fell for. What? She went cuckoo over this guy. Well, their affair went on for a year or so and your mom wanted to marry this guy. She was already married to our real dad. So he said no. He didn't love her anyways. But she wanted him to marry her. And to have a little family. That's when you were born. As a matter of fact, you were really the cause of this whole mess. She wanted to make a little family and take you and this guy someplace and set something up.
MIKE=>That's not how I heard it.
BROTHER=>Yeah, I know. You heard it from me and I'm telling it different this time, see? So this Mom of yours found herself a fuckin' gun. I thought she was going to blow me away with it one night. She got so into this gun. She would flash it to anybody that gave her trouble. She would sleep with it. Yeah... strange, huh? She would stir fry vegetables with the loaded gun. What? I mean What? I used to say, politely, "Mom, don't go stirring up dinner with the gun, now, you'll blow a hole in the frying pan." What?
BROTHER=>And she used to do other things with this gun. Sexy things with it. Oh, boy, she was into this thing. I just thought it was some sort of weird phase that she was going through. And so anyway, this guy, who she was cuckoo over, brought her to the movies one night. A drive-in movie in a stolen car, don't-chaknow, what? And the movie was.... ah.... RIO BRAVO or some shit like that. And well, she went and shot this guy.... don't-cha-know.
MIKE=>You're making this up as you go along, bro.
BROTHER=>And they didn't find him until the next show, RIO BRAVO playing on the big screen. Spilled popcorn soaking up the blood.
SCOTT=>Oh, come on, how corny, man....
BROTHER=>No. Your mom had to split, and split she did. And that guy. That guy was your real father.
BROTHER=>And I got this card from her, not too awful long ago. Maybe a year.
MIKE=>My mother works here. Her name is Dorothy.
HOSTESS=>No. I can't think of anyone by that name. Let me get the manager.
MANAGER=>Dorothy, Dorothy There was a Dorothy Biondi used to work here a year ago, but she split. Saved up all her money and headed to Italy.
MIKE=>To Italy?
MANAGER=>Yeah. It took her forever to save any cash, but she did, and flew away. She was looking for her family. I guess she came from Italy. But she didn't look Italian.
SCOTT=>Was your mom Italian?
MIKE=>I don't know. I guess that she was.
SCOTT=>There's that guy.
MIKE=>Who?
SCOTT=>The guy who gave us a ride from Portland. What's he doing here?
HANS=>Mike! Scottie! How good to run into you! My dear boys! How have you been?
MIKE=>I just got in the tub! Wait your turn.
HANS=>But Mike! Don't you want anything to eat? We are ordering room service. Ya?
MIKE=>Ahhh. Room service? Ya! Let me see. Two hamburgers, with cheese, onions, lettuce, tomato, no pickles. A Coke and french fries.
HANS=>O.K. That's hamburger wiz everything, no pickles, Coke, french fries.
MIKE=>That is correct.
HANS=>Thank you.
MIKE=>You're welcome.
HANS=>How are the hamburgers, boys?
MIKE=>They're okay, Hans.
SCOTT=>Good, Hans. I don't think that I've tasted a hamburger as fine as this Holiday Inn hamburger.
HANS=>I'm glad that you like it.
HANS=>How did you boys get so far? I only left you in Portland a few days ago.
SCOTT=>We rode on our trusty motorcycle.
HANS=>And what brings you to the Holiday Inn?
SCOTT=>Business.
HANS=>What kind of business?
SCOTT=>We're selling motorcycles.
TICKET TAKER=>Do you have any baggage?
MIKE=>Mom?............Hello?
GIRL=>Hello.
SCOTT=>Hi. Is this your house?
GIRL=>No. This isn't my house, but. It is my uncle's house.
SCOTT=>I'm Scott.
GIRL=>I'm Carmella.
SCOTT=>And he is Mike. We came from America to find his mother.
CARMELLA=>Oh. An American woman?
SCOTT=>Yeah, do you know her?
CARMELLA=>Yes, but. It is not true that she lives here..
SCOTT=>It isn't true?
CARMELLA=>No. She left a long time ago. Back to America.
SCOTT=>Oh, shit. Was she your friend?
CARMELLA=>I wanted to speak English, and she taught it to me.
CARMELLA=>Hello. My name is Carmella.
MIKE=>I'm Mike.
CARMELLA=>Hello Mike.
SCOTT=>She knows your mom.
MIKE=>I mean, Christ, we come all this fuckin' way and she ain't here either. Where'd she go from here?
SCOTT=>Hey, Mike. Let me talk with you for a second.
SCOTT=>I'm gonna take some time off.
SCOTT=>Don't leave home without it. Ha- ha. I mean, maybe I'll run into you down the road.
MIKE=>Yeah, sure. Okay.
SCOTT=>Sorry about this, dude.
MIKE=>I'll be okay. Don't worry about me.
SCOTT=>Sorry, but....
MIKE=>No, man, forget it. Hurry up, she's waiting, you're gonna lose her.
SCOTT=>All right. You sure you'll be okay?
MIKE=>Go on, get out of here.
MIKE'S THOUGHTS:=>Well. So much for the great protector-of-us-all. Protector of himself, more like. I couldn't believe Scott would leave me here in the middle of a foreign country.
STEWARDESS=>Wake up. Wake up, we're here.
MIKE=>Where? Where am I?
STEWARDESS=>You're in Portland.
MIKE=>And so, I was back in Portland, enjoying the life I used to lead. It was like I was back from a vacation. Denise had a boyfriend now....
MIKE=>... and I enjoyed the fruits of my labor.
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>And there were new kids who were coming around who wanted to take your money. It was a dark period for the streets. Normally, Scott would keep order In the Broadway Cafe.
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>Gary and Ray both got work at stands. It was funny...
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>( they both sold hot dogs. Which is what they were used to selling on the streets in the old days. These guys had really changed, I thought.
BAD GEORGE=>Bob! What tidings I bring you. And such joy. Some of that old rot gut that you and I used to drink. I have three bottles stashed in the bushes out on eighty-second.
BOB=>What blew you in?
BAD GEORGE=>Think of the fun we can have, if we could only rind a ride for a journey to the bushes where the hooch is hid.
BOB=>If I shared your wine, I might catch this awful disease you appear to have. My clothes would turn striped, and I would suddenly have bells on my toes, like this here...
BAD GEORGE=>Bob, you're one of the greatest living men on Three-street.
BOB=>That is correct.
BAD GEORGE=>Surely you can find us a ride somewhere.
MIKE'S THOUGHTS:=>As I listened to Bad George and Bob talk, I watched across the street as a long black car pulled up alongside one of the fancier restaurant/bar establishments of Portland. And who got out of that car? It was the old protector-of- us-all, himself Scottie Favor.
BOB=>If it isn't Scottie Favor himself. Blessed are they who have been my close friends. Now dressed in a three pieced suit and looking every bit a gentleman! He has run into his inheritance.
BAD GEORGE=>Who?
BOB=>George, Budd, Mike. We have waited for this day to come.
MAN=>Scottie! I haven't seen you in a dog's age. You're looking well. So grown up. Scottie, I'd like you to meet Ed Warren, he's in marketing at Nike. Ed, this is Scottie Favor.
ED=>Oh, Jack Favor's son, hello, pleased to meet you.
SCOTTIE=>How do you do?
BOB=>Come, George, watch this. You will see the attention that I get.
BOB=>It's true we're drawing attention to ourselves. But Scottie will see that I am dying to see him, and it won't matter how we're dressed.
BOB=>God save you! God save you, my sweet boy.
BOB=>Sonny! My true friend!
BOB=>I mean you, Sonny! It's me, Bob!
SCOTT=>I don't know you, old man.
GIRL IN CROWD=>Who is that bum?
SCOTTIE=>Please leave me alone.
SCOTTIE=>Don't think that I'm the same Scottie that I was before. Everyone has noticed that I have turned away from that life, and the people who kept me company.
SCOTTIE=>When I was young, and you were my street tutor. An instigator for my bad behavior, I was trying to change. Now that I have, and until I change back don't come near me.
BUDD=>Don't take all this seriously. It's one of his jokes.
BOB=>God, God.... God!
MIKE=>Pigeon?
A BOY=>Scottie Favor broke his heart.
GARY=>He's gone now, either to Heaven or to Hell.
JANE LIGHTWORK=>Be sure it isn't to Hell. He tried to be an honest sort. I'm the one who heard him cry out last night. He said God, God, God... three or four times. And when I got there I put my hand into the bed and felt his feet. And they were cold as stone. And I checked the rest of his body. And it too was as cold as stone.
BUDD=>It sure is quiet.
MIKE=>I guess you're gonna miss him the most, Budd.
MIKE=>Here. Maybe you can give him a good burial.
MIKE'S VOICE=>I suppose that a lot of kids like me think that they have no home, that home is a place where you have a mom and a dad.
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>But home can be any place that you want. Or wherever you can find My home is right here on the side of this road, that I been to before. I just know I been on this fucking road one time before, you know that?
MIKE'S THOUGHTS=>Sometimes I had thought that God had not smiled on me, and had given me a bum deal. And other times, I had thought that God had smiled on me. Like now. He was smiling on me... for the time being....
