MITCHELL=>Is everybody in there?
BOB=>They're waiting for you. And they're very nervous.
REED=>I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year. The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet. We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
MITCHELL=>Dammit... I told them no mayo. See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
MITCHELL=>Do you know why I don't want to do it?
MITCHELL=>... Because it's got homeless shelters... and Head Start centers ... and... and...
BOB=>Hot lunches.
MITCHELL=>... And hot lunches for little And if I kill it... I'll look like a prick.
MITCHELL=>And I don't want to look like a prick! I want YOU to look like pricks!!!
SPEAKER=>Sir, we tried to kill it twice...
MITCHELL=>I don't think so, Howard. If you had killed it -- it would be dead. When I kill something - - it always dies. Doesn't it, flob?
BOB=>Always dead.
MAJ. LEADER=>Mr. President, with all the work your wife has done with the homeless...
MITCHELL=>Norman, I don't want you to do this cause you're forced to... I want you to do this because you want to. I want you to do it because you think it's the right thing to do. I want you to do it because you're acting in the best interests of our country...
BOB=>Well -- I think that's it.
BOB=>... You've got that radio address to go over and the American Bar Association at the Monroe tomorrow night...
MITCHELL=>The Monroe?
REED=>Uh, yes, sir. The Monroe Hotel...
MITCHELL=>Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
REED=>We're working on it.
MITCHELL=>Try to find someone who looks like me this time. That last guy was a joke.
REED=>We're doing our best, sir.
DURENBURGER=>This is a real special moment here at Durenburger's Chrysler Plymouth... Ladies an' gentlemen, I wantcha to give a real warm welcome to... The President of the United
WIDER=>A dead-ringer for the President appears, perched on the back of a four hundred pound pig. He is DAVE KOVIC, our hero. Dave enters from "stage right" wearing an Uncle Sam hat and waving triumphantly to the crowd. A teenage *boy pulls the pig forward by a rope.
DAVE=>Thank you, Don. Thank you for that warm introduction. You know it's wonderful to be here today amongst so many smiling faces.
DAVE=>And, Don, let me assure you from one chief executive to another, that there fl no Chrysler Plymouth like Durenburger's Chrysler Plymouth.
DURENBURGER=>Thank you, Mr. President. It certainly is nice of you to be with us here today considering your busy schedule and all.
DAVE=>Well, Don -- it's true that I have a busy schedule. But I've got a feeling that when folks find out about your five hundred dollar cash rebate on all `93 LeBaron and LeBaron convertibles you're gonna be even busier than I am.
GIRL=>Mommy, is that the President?
MOTHER=>I sure hope not.
DAVE=>You know, Don, it's not easy being President. Why just the other day, I was riding on Air Force One...
ANGLE-DAVE=>He stops the routine and squints out toward the crowd while the WAILING CONTINUES. His parents try to comfort the BOY but it doesn't do any good.
DAVE=>Hey, hey... What's the matter...
DAVE=>Hi... What's your name?
DAVE=>Don't you have a name?
CHILD=>... Sam.
DAVE=>Hi, Sam... You want a riddle?
DAVE=>Okay. What can run all day without getting tired?
DAVE=>Well come on, Sam. It's not your jar...
SAM=>My nose?
DAVE=>Right. !!!
JERRY=>Six-thirty?
ALICE=>Perfect.
JERRY=>Great, I'll see you then.
JERRY=>Hi, Dave.
DAVE=>Hi, .....
DAVE=>It went great, Alice. I killed em down there.
ALICE=>Yeah? Why don't you see what you *) can do in here.
DIFFERENT ANGLE=>Dave turns around to see three women stacked up in his waiting area.
DAVE=>No problem. What `ve we got?
ALICE=>Mabel says it's too far on the bus. Jennifer's boss tried to hit on her again and Lola's been crying in your office for an hour.
DAVE=>Lola. What happened?
LOLA=>Oh, Meester Kobic... Is no my fault... I learn on de I.B.M okay? Then they make me work on de Wang... No puedo comprendar esta machina...
DAVE=>It's airight. We'll find you something else.
DAVE=>I'll get her something right now. Alice... Have you seen my checkbook?
ALICE=>Dave, I'm your ex-wife. As in Ex E -- X...
ALICE=>Bottom drawer next to your baseball glove.
DAVE=>Thanks. You're the best.
MURRAY=>Dave, I can't hire anybody else.
MURRAY=>I don't have enough work for the people you gave me already.
DAVE=>She's got three kids and the husband's a diabetic... Diabetic?
LOLA=>Si. Diabetico.
DAVE=>Short-term thing. Straight temp job.
MURRAY=>I'll see what I can do.
DAVE=>So you want to go swimming?
MURRAY=>Dave -- I'm working.
DAVE=>Oh yeah... Me, too. You want to get dinner later?
MURRAY=>I was gonna do something with Joan.
DAVE=>Oh. Okay. I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
DAVE=>'... klahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plain...'
DAVE=>`Where the wavin' wheat, can sure smell sweet...'
DAVE=>'and the wind comes right behind the -
DUANE=>Mr. Kovic?
DUANE=>I'm Duane Stavensen with the United States Secret Service.
DUANE=>We're with the federal government.
DAVE=>Oh my God... I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
DUANE=>Mr. Kovic. We're not here about your taxes.
DAVE=>You're not?
DUANE=>No.
DUANE=>Your government needs your help.
DAVE=>What?
DUANE=>On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
DAVE=>Really?
DUANE=>We'd like to hire you.
DAVE=>Really?
JOHNNY=>Johnny, you did it again!
DAVE=>You really cut his this short?
JOHNNY=>It's a perfect match.
DAVE=>Hunh. 'Cause I always thought it came over the ears a little...
BOB=>You understand what you'll be doing?
DAVE=>Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
BOB=>Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
DAVE=>`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean, if you wanted me to talk or...
BOB=>Don't say a .
DAVE=>Right.
DAVE=>Uh --Mr. Alexander?
BOB=>What?
DAVE=>Is this dangerous or anything?
BOB=>No more than the usual.
DAVE=>The usual...
REED=>We're all set, sir.
MITCHELL=>What about the intro?
REED=>It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
MITCHELL=>It better be. Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
MITCHELL=>Who's this priest I'm thanking?
REED=>Father Mclntire. He blessed you at the inauguration.
MITCHELL=>Oh yeah. Did you take care of later on?
REED=>All set.
MITCHELL=>Fabulous.
MITCHELL=>You know as I was coming in here tonight I ran into Jordan Blankfort who I hadn't seen for years...
MITCHELL=>And I couldn'thelp remembering back to the time when Jordan and I were in law school together. ... Now Jordan and I were pretty wild back then and like most college students, we liked to enjoy a few beers on occasion...
DUANE=>Get readY.
MITCHELL=>God bless you... God bless America...
MITCHELL=>Jesus Christ.
WIDER ANGLE=>The President stares at him carefully.
MITCHELL=>You are a very handsome man.
DAVE=>Thank you, Mr. President.
MITCHELL=>Just get rid of that grin. You look like a schmuck.
DAVE=>Hello America! God Bless you!
DIFFERENT ANGLE=>The car speeds away from the curb with the motorcade behind it.
DAVE=>Sorry, I couldn't help it. I just got carried away... ... I was really good though, hunh?
DAVE=>So I guess there must be something pretty important going on for the President to go through all of this...
MAN=>Oh...
WOMAN=>Ah!
MAN=>Oh...
WOMAN=>Ah!
WOMAN=>Ahhh!
WOMAN=>Ahhhhh!
WOMAN=>Bill?
RANDI=>Mr. President?
RANDI=>Oh; shit...
REED=>It doesn't look very good.
REED=>They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
BOB=>I can't believe he'd do this.
REED=>I know.
BOB=>Where's the girl?
REED=>She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
BOB=>Nightmare...
REED=>Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
BOB=>Don't call the Vice President!
REED=>... What?
BOB=>Just don't call him, Alan!
REED=>The guy's in a coma, Bob.
BOB=>I don't give a shit.
REED=>Bob...
BOB=>This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him. And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
DAVE=>You know if you guys want to do something for his birthday, I could come down to Washington. I have some great birthday stuff...
DAVE=>I do this thing with the first lady -- my friends love it -- it's the two of them going away to Club Med...
DUANE=>Yeah...
DAVE=>What?
BOB=>It's a temporary solution.
REED=>Till what?
BOB=>TilT we figure something out.
REED=>Bob, the guy had a stroke!
BOB=>Look, everything can be handled. We'll just find a way to handle it.
REED=>Like how?
BOB=>Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
REED=>Mild stroke?
BOB=>Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
REED=>Up and around? Soon?
BOB=>Soon.
DAVE=>You know, I think I've been real cooperative up until now but...
DAVE=>Just tell me where we're going.
DAVE=>Holy shit.
REED=>Dave, my name is Alan Reed. I'm the White House Communications Director. This is Bob Alexander, our Chief of Staff. We met you earlier tonight at the hotel, remember?
REED=>Can I get you something to drink?
REED=>You sure? A Coke or a Perrier or something?
DAVE=>Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
REED=>Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
DAVE=>Look, I'm sorry. I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
REED=>We're not upset with you, Dave. We think you did a terrific job. Don't we?
BOB=>Terrific.
REED=>In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
DAVE=>Extend things?
REED=>Extend them. C'mere for a second.
REED=>Try it out.
REED=>Go ahead.
DIFFERENT ANGLE=>Reed looks over at Bob, who nods at him. He takes a deep breath.
REED=>Dave, something has happened to the President.
DAVE=>Oh my God...
REED=>I know... I know... It's difficult for all of us. But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
DAVE=>What happened?
REED=>Well, it's... It's sort of an... an `incident' really...
BOB=>A condition...
REED=>Exactly. A condition.
REED=>It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
DAVE=>Oh my gosh...
DAVE=>Will he be alright?
REED=>Oh, yeah... probably...
BOB=>We think so.
REED=>Yes.
DAVE=>Oh.
REED=>Dave, we need our friends and even our enemies to feel safe and secure... We need them to feel like they can go to bed at night knowing President Mitchell is fully in control... We need them to feel like he's sitting right here in this chair...
DAVE=>Hey - - wait a second...
DAVE=>What about the Vice President?
RTED=>Vice Presidant?
BOB=>Well... We didn't want to have to get into this but... ... The Vice President is mentally unbalanced.
DAVE=>No.
REED=>I'm afraid so.
DAVE=>Really? Crazy?
BOB=>Certifiable.
BOB=>How much do you usually get paid?
DAVE=>Uh -- I don't know. Sometimes it's just like a barter thing... Is this legal?
REED=>Dave - - have you ever driven through a red light?
REED=>You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
DAVE=>I'm not sure... I might have.
REED=>Well, let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital. You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
DAVE=>Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
REED=>Now, let's say the whole country. Was in that car. The entire United States of America.
DAVE=>In the car?
REED=>In the car.
DAVE=>I see what you mean.
REED=>Dave, the country is sick. And we're gonna get it to a hospital.
BOB=>These are the living quarters. The President's bedroom is on this side and the First Lady's is over there.
WIDER=>Dave walks forward in awe.
DAVE=>First Lady...
BOB=>Don't worry. You won't even see her.
BOB=>They barely talk anymore.
DAVE=>You're kidding?
BOB=>It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping.
DAVE=>Holy cow.
BOB=>We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
DAVE=>Oh... Okay.
KATHLEEN SULLIVAN=>... The White House now classifies the President's condition as a `slight circulatory problem of the head.'
KATHLEEN SULLIVAN=>Although technically a stroke, spokesmen say the President's condition is far from serious and he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
REED=>Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
BOB=>It's simple, Alan. We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one. The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
REED=>You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
BOB=>I was a senator, you know.
REED=>Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
BOB=>What about containment, Alan?
REED=>I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
BOB=>Is that everybody?
REED=>Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
BOB=>What about her.
REED=>Her?... Oh -- the First Lady... She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr. I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
BOB=>And...
REED=>I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
BOB=>Fine.
REED=>Everybody else is buying the minor stroke' story...
BOB=>I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
DOCTOR=>Well, I must say, Mr. President, even for a man with a mild stroke you seem to have made a remarkable recovery.
DAVE=>Thanks. I'm feeling much better.
DOCTOR=>No signs of paralysis, no circulatory changes. Your E.M.G. is completely normal and your blood pressure has even gone down. Have you been exercising recently?
DAVE=>Just the usual.. Watching the diet -- A little weight lifting... Some power talking...
DOCTOR=>Well, judging from these tests, I don't see any reason why you couldn't start back to work within a couple of days.
BOB=>Now, remember -- keep it simple.
DAVE=>Don't worry.
DAVE=>Good morning, Clara...
CLARA=>Good morning, Mr. President.
DAVE=>Good morning, Diane...
DIANE=>Good morning, sir.
DAVE=>Good morning, Randi...
DIFFERENT ANGLE=>She leans forward, grasping his hand, desperately.
RANDI=>Oh, good morning, Mr. President. I'm so relieved that you're alright. You really had me scared.
DAVE=>What's with her?
BOB=>Don't worry about it.
REED=>She's just a little emotional -- she feels kind of attached to the President.
BOB=>Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
DAVE=>And we're going away for a holiday.
BOB=>For a month.
DAVE=>A month.
BOB=>Right and don't embellish.
DAVE=>I promise. I won't.
ALICE=>I couldn't believe it. As soon as we sit down he pulls out this ring... ... Oh I know - -I just got so emotional. The waiter had to bring me another napkin.
ALICE=>Hang on. Kovic Temps Dave! Where are you? You met who?.., You're going where? Cancun.
ALICE=>No, that's fine... No, I think it's great.., Sure, I understand I will... Okay... 'Bye.
ALICE=>He's in love Thank God!
SANDER VANOCUR=>The President continued his convalescence, resting in the white House for the second straight day. His personal physician pronounced him in perfectly good health...
PRESIDENT' S PHYSICIAN=>I've examined him thoroughly and I must say, I don't think I've ever seen the President in better shape.
SANDER VANOCUR=>The President was able to attend to Some official business on Wednesday, and continues to be briefed on all areas of national concern...
SANDER VANOCUR=>So confident was the white House in the President's recovery, that they have just sent the Vice President on a twelve nation African goodwill tour... This is Sander Vanocur at the white House.
BOB=>First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms. Alan has put together sort of a training program
DAVE=>Great.
REED=>Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first. You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
DAVE=>A teleprompter.
REED=>What?
DAVE=>The teleprompter. Is it hooked up?
REED=>I don't think so.
DAVE=>Oh.
REED=>As I was saying, no one expects you to be Bill Mitchell overnight.
DAVE=>Presence.
REED=>Right. Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
DAVE=>At a press conference.
REED=>What?
DAVE=>That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
BOB=>I'm not certain about...
DAVE=>Oh, sure. Remember the convention speech?
DAVE=>'An America stronger than the one we were given. An America prouder than the one we found.' He has 'em right there on the side.
REED=>You know that's very good.
DAVE=>Oh, I loved that speech.
REED=>Thanks, I wrote it.
DAVE=>... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
REED=>Dave...
DAVE=>'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...' Hand on the heart...
BOB=>Dave...
DAVE=>It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung... Hands to the side...
REED=>Dave!
DAVE=>'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
DAVE=>So when do we start?
ANDREA MITCHELL=>Tom, virtually every reporter in Washington is camped out here awaiting the President's first appearance since his Stroke...
ANDREA MITCHELL=>Even though some may find his recovery amazing, White House officials claim they never expected less from a man who always expects so much from himself.
DAVE=>I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
REED=>It's just five minutes. She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
DAVE=>Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
REED=>She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
BOB=>Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
DAVE=>... Alright.
BOB=>Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony. All you have to say is `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
DAVE=>`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
REED=>Exactly. She doesn't always like this stuff and it might soften her up.
BOB=>We're ready.
WOMAN=>Why can't you die from a stroke like everybody else?
ELLEN=>What are you staring at?
DAVE=>Uh...
REED=>We're Gonna do it right out here.
ELLEN=>Who was it, Bill? A Secretary?
DAVE=>Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
ELLEN=>Go tuck yourself, Bill.
BOB=>Well, perhaps we can get started now.
ELLEN=>And you can tell those two pit vipers this is the last one of these I'll be doing for a while.
REED=>Smile!
REED=>Wave!
YELLOW ROOM=>Bob and Reed are huddled beside the window.
REED=>Fine.
DAVE=>Fine.
REED=>You bet.
DAVE=>You bet.
ELLEN=>I'm outta here.
ELLEN=>Don't you have anything to say to me?
DAVE=>Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
ELLEN=>You don't change, do you, Bill?
DAVE=>She hates me.
DAVE=>Duane?
DAVE=>... Can I get a bite? I'm kinda hungry.
DAVE=>You gotta try this. It's my special sandwich.
DAVE=>Everybody loves this sandwich.
DUANE=>What's in it?
DAVE=>Oh, that's a secret.
DAVE=>So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
DUANE=>I can't say.
DAVE=>You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
DUANE=>I can't say.
DAVE=>Oh.
DAVE=>So you just protect the President the whole time? That's your whole job?
DUANE=>Yeah.
DAVE=>You got a gun?
DUANE=>Of course.
AVE=>Can I See it?
DUANE=>Well, it's really not policy to...
DAVE=>I understand.
DAVE=>You ever use it?
DUANE=>No.
DAVE=>Huh. You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
DUANE=>What about it?
DAVE=>Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
DUANE=>Certainly.
DAVE=>So that means, now you'd get killed for me too?
DAVE=>Here. Try this.
REED=>Clean.
BOB=>What do you mean, he's clean?
REED=>I mean I've checked everything. Women. Liquor... Finances. I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
BOB=>No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
REED=>The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob. He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
BOB=>What about the wife?
REED=>Clean.
BOB=>Check his kids.
REED=>Clean.
BOB=>Nobody's got clean kids.
REED=>We've got nothing, Bob. This won't work.
BOB=>If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up. Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months. The whole thing is under control.
REED=>You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
DISTINGUISHED MAN=>Bob... Alan... Your boy sure looks great. I think he sounds even better'n he did before this stroke.
BOB=>Well, thanks very much, Judge. We'll tell him you sent your best.
DISTINGUISHED MAN=>You take care, now.
BOB=>Yeah, you, too.
GM PRESIDENT=>Now this man is using a robotic mechanism for picking up the engine. The large arms that you see duplicate all of his arm movements exactly, so it's as if he's lifting two thousand pounds.
DAVE=>Can I try it?
GM PRESIDENT=>Huh? Uh, well...
BOB=>Mr. President...
DAVE=>I mean, if it's a problem...
GM PRESIDENT=>No, no. It's really quite simple. Just come on over here.
GM PRESIDENT=>Now, you slip your hands into these sleeves here...
DAVE=>I once caught a fish this big.
REED=>He's a soundbite machine...
GERGEN=>I don't know about you, Mark, but I don't think I've ever seen the President as relaxed or comfortable with himself as he is right now.
SHIELDS=>Oh, I agree, David. I don't know who gave him happy pills but this is a pretty unbelievable transformation.
GERGEN=>Well, I think it's a kind of 'rebirth' really. This is a man who's stared death in the face and it's obviously had a profound effect on him.
SHIELDS=>Look, if that's what a stroke'll do for ya, I'll take a couple of dozen.
ELLEN=>What a jerk.
LENO=>How 'bout the President these days huh? One minute he has a stroke the next he's doing push-ups. Must make it a lot easier on the Secret Service when all they have to worry about is Kryptonite.
DAVE=>Okay -- first we're gonna hear from Ted on the land management legislation...
ELLEN=>You're misinterpreting it, Nathan -- that's not what the study said. It said if the mother got less than 1100 calories the child would risk a low birthrate...
ELLEN=>Nathan?... Hang on a second. Will you turn that thing up?
MCLAUGHLIN=>Issue One: 'The New Bill Mitchell.' Two weeks after his brush with death the President is suddenly bounding around the country with the energy of a high school track star. Is this merely overcompensation or the indefatigable greatness of a truly great man. Mor-ton...
MORT KONDRACKE=>Well, he looks pretty great to me. I think the President is showing the same strength of character he did when he first got elected.
ELEANOR CLIFT=>You know, Mort, every time this guy has a blip in the polls you start genuflecting...
MORT KONDRACKE=>Hey -- I think he looks great.
CHRIS MATHEWS=>Yeah, he looks great 'cause they're makin' him look great. This puppet show at the auto plant was the most manipulative piece of political theater I've ever seen.
FRED BARNES=>Oh, come on, Chris. You're just steamed 'cause he's doing well.
CHRIS MATHEWS=>I am not...
FRED BARNES=>Is he doing well?
CHRIS MATHEWS=>Well... Yeah... He's doing well...
MCLAUGHLIN=>Answer: He's doing very well. We'll get to predictions right after this.
PUBLIC ADDRESS ANNOUNCER=>Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out the ceremonial first pitch... The President of the United States.
LARRY KING=>We're back with Oliver Stone, talking about what seems like a pretty far- fetched theory...
WIDER=>Oliver Stone sits across the desk.
OLIVER STONE=>There's something going on here, Larry, and no one is telling us the truth.
LARRY KING=>Oliver, the guy had a little stroke. He's enjoying life a little...
OLIVER STONE=>If you look at a photograph of Bill Mitchell before the stroke, and another one right after...
LARRY KING=>Aren't you being a little paranoid?
OLIVER STONE=>Have you compared the photographs?
FOLLOWING DAVE=>Dave reaches the open doorway and slides quickly against the wall. Slowly, carefully he bends his head and peeks into the room.
REED=>Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
BOB=>Are you out of your mind?
REED=>Uh, let me get back to you...
BOB=>You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
REED=>It's a homeless shelter.
BOB=>Oh. Excuse me.
REED=>It's gonna be great. 'Caring about his wife.' 'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
BOB=>I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
REED=>Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
REED=>I just dumped it on him instead.
BOB=>When does it break?
REED=>Couple of days. Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
BOB=>Alan, we still have to control this guy...
REED=>And look at this. Russell came around on the trade bill.
BOB=>You're kidding.
REED=>How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
BOB=>Three years.
REED=>I'm telling you, Bob, it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
ELLEN=>Why are you doing this, Bill?
DAVE=>What?
ELLEN=>Since when do you care about the homeless?
DAVE=>I care about the homeless.
ELLEN=>Yeah. I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
CLOSER=>Their eyes lock for a moment. Dave smiles quickly and glances out the window. Ellen looks down at her own leg a little puzzled.
REED=>Okay, it's straight klick and smile but there's a great visual in the kitchen so make sure you stop at the soup.
ELLEN=>One of the things they're trying to do here at Helping Hand, is keep verbal skills alive. The first thing that goes with these kids is their ability to communicate and they need to get to them before this happens.
DAVE=>Hi there.
DAVE=>You like cartoons?
DAVE=>Could you just stop that for a second.
DAVE=>You like Tweety Bird?
DAVE=>So, which one do you like?
KID=>Sylvester.
DAVE=>Sylvester?
DAVE=>But he's a cat.
DAVE=>Gimme a quarter.
REED=>What?
DAVE=>Quick. Gimme a quarter.
DAVE=>Okay - - what can run all day without getting tired.
KID=>My nose?
KOPPEL=>What makes a man rise to a particular moment in history? What makes a man in the thicket of middle age, suddenly rediscover himself with the wonder of a child.
KOPPEL=>Later on tonight, we'll talk with Dr. Henry Mueller who is an expert in the psychological effects of a mid-life health crisis... and to Gail Sheehy, who has just co-authored a book on male menopause.
DAVE=>`Bum, bum da dum...'
WOMAN=>I can't believe you'd do something like that. Not even you.
WIDER=>The door to the shower swings open as Ellen materializes. No queen of England ever looked more regal than Ellen Mitchell in her cloud of steam.
ELLEN=>How could you?
DAVE=>... How could I what?
ELLEN=>Oh, come on, Bill. Don't patronize me. I'm not one of your little... Turn around. I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
ELLEN=>... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine. I can handle it. But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
DAVE=>I don't understand.
ELLEN=>That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes... ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
DAVE=>What's wrong with a magic trick?
ELLEN=>You made their funding disappear!
DAVE=>Look. If there was some mistake...
ELLEN=>There's no mistake, Bill. If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
DAVE=>Call Bob and Reed. Tell them I need them immediately.
DUANE=>But it's ten-thirty at night.
DUANE=>Yeah, sure. You got it.
BOB=>What the hell is this?
DAVE=>What the hell is this ?
BOB=>The Washington Post.
DAVE=>No...
REED=>President vetoes works bill?
DAVE=>We vetoed that?
BOB=>No!... WE didn't anything...
REED=>Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
DAVE=>That shelter was in this bill.
BOB=>Alan
DAVE=>Lots of shelters were in this bill.
BOB=>) Listen, you little...
REED=>Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing. Even I don't understand it sometimes. Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
DAVE=>But we went there. We saw those kids.
BOB=>Yeah. And if you can find a way to cut THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS from the federal budget, then you can keep your lousy shelters, okay.
MURRAY=>I'm here to see... the President?
MURRAY=>He asked me to come.
MURRAY=>I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
DAVE=>It's fine.
MURRAY=>They could put you in jail.
DAVE=>Why would they do that. They hired me.
DAVE=>It's kind of a national emergency thing. I can't really talk about it... Paying me big money too. C'mere.
DAVE=>See.
MURRAY=>Are we being taped?
DAVE=>I don't think so
MURRAY=>This is undeclared income.
DAVE=>And who's gonna find out?
MURRAY=>The government
DAVE=>I am the government.
DAVE=>I know -- kind of wild, huh? Let's get to work.
MURRAY=>I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books?
DAVE=>I'm not sure.
MURRAY=>I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
DAVE=>I'm not surprised. Can we save anywhere?
MURRAY=>Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some choices.
DAVE=>Choices?
MURRAY=>You know -- priorities. Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
DAVE=>You could buy it on payments.
MURRAY=>Yeah. That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
DAVE=>So what do we do?
MURRAY=>Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
DAVE=>It's alright. I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
CLOSER ANGLE=>Bob sits down next to Reed unfolding a copy of the paper.
BOB=>Its a work of art. Look at this thing.
BOB=>`Vice President's office linked to First Liberty scandal. Justice Department may investigate.' Alan, you're a genius -- we're on our way!
BOB=>What's with the cameras?
REED=>Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch.
BOB=>Oh. Fine.
DAVE=>Good morning, everybody.
CABINET=>Good morning, Mr. President.
DAVE=>Before we get started today there are a few things I'd like to go over in the budget.
BOB=>Do we have anything on the budget today?
REED=>I don't think so.
DAVE=>Now I think I've found some ways to put back the homeless section of the Simpson Garner works bill.
BOB=>Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
DAVE=>Well it's a last minute change.
DAVE=>The way I see it we need three hundred and fifty million dollars in order to keep the program. Now some of this can be achieved through some simple changes in cash management. For example...
DAVE=>According to the O.M.B. we have seventeen defense contractors who are delinquent in their contracts. Is that true?
DIRECTOR OF O.M.B.=>Uh... I believe so... Yes.
DAVE=>So even though they're late, we keep paying them on time?
DIRECTOR OF O.M.B.=>Well -- in a sense... yeah.
DAVE=>Now instead of giving them money for something they haven't finished, we could hold back that cash, put it aside in some interest bearing...
BOB=>Mr. President!
DAVE=>Yes?
BOB=>.. Nothing.
DAVE=>Great.
DAVE=>Like I was saying, if we took that cash and stuck it in even an ordinary savings account, we'd be making twelve million a month in interest.
SECRETARY OF TREASURY=>Well, technically that's true...
SECRETARY OF TREASURY=>Yes. Yes, I suppose that's true.
DAVE=>But unfortunately, money management only gets us halfway to our goal. To find the rest of the money, we're going to have to start making some choices - - some pretty tough choices...
BOB=>Choices???
DAVE=>Yes, Bob. Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE=>Yes, Mr. President?
DAVE=>You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to... 'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE=>And it's proving quite effective...
DAVE=>Does it make the cars any better?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE=>No, sir. It's more of a perceptual issue.
DAVE=>Perceptual?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE=>Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
DAVE=>Why?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE=>Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
DAVE=>So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE=>Yes, but I wouldn't...
DAVE=>Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars. Do you want to tell him that?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE=>Me? Uh, no sir... I sure don't.
DAVE=>Good. That gives us another forty- seven million. Now the Postal Service...
POSTMASTER GENERAL=>Yes, Mr. President!
DAVE=>Okay, so that makes... ... Two, eighty-four, carry the three... ... Three hundred and fifty-six million. ... And that means we can keep the program.
VARIOUS CABINET MEMBERS=>Wonderful job, sir... Fantastic, Mr. President.
REED=>What are you gonna do?
BOB=>I'm going to kill him.
REED=>You can't kill a President.
BOB=>He's not a President! He's an ordinary person. I can kill an ordinary person.
REED=>Bob...
BOB=>I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
REED=>He's only doing what you told him to.
BOB=>What I told him to?
REED=>I heard you. You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
BOB=>Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
REED=>He was only doing his job.
BOB=>His job? His job!!!
BOB=>It's not his job -- It's my job!
REED=>Bob...
BOB=>Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free. I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
REED=>Don't do this.
BOB=>I'll lock him away for good.
REED=>Then we'll all go to jail together.
BOB=>What do you mean by that?
REED=>Just what you think I mean.
BOB=>Are you threatening me?
REED=>Sort of... Yeah.
AIDE=>You won't believe this.
ELLEN=>`Saves homeless plan'?
DAVE=>Thanks. You did great. Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
MURRAY=>That'd be great.
DAVE=>Well -- take care.
MURRAY=>Yeah. Don't get into trouble.
WIDER ANGLE=>He throws the car into gear and starts down the long, bending driveway toward the gate. Dave watches from the edge of the lawn with a fond look on his face...
DUANE=>Gin.
DAVE=>I was waiting for that jack.
DUANE=>I had a feeling.
DAVE=>Duane?
DUANE=>Yeah?
DAVE=>How come you went along with all of this?
DUANE=>You mean with you and everything?
DAVE=>Yeah.
DUANE=>`Bleed for your king.'
DAVE=>What's that?
DUANE=>First thing they teach you at the academy. `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
DAVE=>You're kidding.
DUANE=>No... They don't kid.
DAVE=>But Bill was your king, not Bob.
DUANE=>Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
DUANE=>We're trained to be loyal. You gotta be loyal to someone.
DAVE=>Didn't mean to bum you out.
DUANE=>That's okay. You alright down here by yourself?
DAVE=>Oh, sure. Don't worry about it.
ELLEN=>Hello.
DAVE=>Ellen?
ELLEN=>I saw the light. I thought maybe you were up.
DAVE=>Oh... Yeah.
ELLEN=>Mind if I sit down?
DAVE=>No.
ELLEN=>That was quite a thing you did today.
DAVE=>Anybody would have done it.
ELLEN=>Oh, I don't think so. Still, you helped a lot of people.
ELLEN=>Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
DAVE=>Oh yeah? Me, too.
ELLEN=>You weren't in the state legislature.
ELLEN=>I'm Ellen Mitchell.
ELLEN=>What's your name?
ELLEN=>Look, I'll make this easy on you. I never see him anymore. I barely know him anymore. I'd just kinda like to know where he is.
ELLEN=>I mean, what is it? Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.' Where is he?
DAVE=>I don't know.
DUANE=>I really shouldn't be doing this.
DAVE=>Open it.
ELLEN=>Just open it, please.
NURSE=>I'm sorry, you're not allowed...
DUANE=>It's alright.
NURSE=>Mr. Alexander left strict...
ELLEN=>What happened?
DUANE=>It's the stroke. It's pretty bad.
ELLEN=>I don't understand. Is he, I mean...
DUANE=>I'm sorry.
ELLEN=>Don't touch me, please.
ELLEN=>When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now? After the election... What's going on here?
DAVE=>They asked me to help.
ELLEN=>I'm sure they did. 'State of Emergency.' 'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
ELLEN=>Could all of you just leave me alone for a minute.
NURSE=>I'm really not supposed to...
ELLEN=>Get out!
DAVE=>You're leaving?
ELLEN=>I'm not the First Lady, anymore. I shouldn't be here.
DAVE=>Where are you going?
ELLEN=>Home.
DAVE=>Where's home?
ELLEN=>Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
DAVE=>Just souvenirs. Towels and stuff.
ELLEN=>You1re leaving, too?
DAVE=>I never wanted to hurt anybody. In fact... I even thought I was helping.
DAVE=>Hey... It's...
DIFFERENT ANGLE=>Ellen is crying. She shakes her head and turns away from him.
DAVE=>Here.
ELLEN=>You know you make this little deal with yourself.
ELLEN=>You can put up with the other women and you can do without a life because you believe in what you're doing - - and if you can just keep your mouth shut...
DAVE=>You thought you had a chance to help people...
DAVE=>How were you gonna get home?
ELLEN=>I don't know. I hadn't thought it out that far.
ELLEN=>You sure this goes somewhere?
DAVE=>Truman used it all the time.
ELLEN=>You don't have to keep walking with me. I'm okay from here.
DAVE=>I don't mind.
ELLEN=>Thanks.
CLOSER SHOT=>Dave and Ellen emerge stepping out onto the sidewalk.
ELLEN=>Huh.
DAVE=>Duane said he'd leave the car over here.
DAVE=>Here you go.
DAVE=>He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
ELLEN=>Oh... Okay.
DAVE=>What?
ELLEN=>It's just so strange...
ELLEN=>I lock at you and I see Bill... I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
DAVE=>I'm not Bill Mitchell.
DAVE=>In fact, I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
ELLEN=>He wasn't always like that, anyway.
DAVE=>Are you hungry?
ELLEN=>What?
DAVE=>I'm starving. There's got to be something open around here.
ELLEN=>I really don't have much of an appetite.
DAVE=>Just wait.
ELLEN=>This is good. What's in it?
DAVE=>That's a secret.
ELLEN=>You have a lot of secrets.
DAVE=>I guess.
DAVE=>When did you know?... About me.
ELLEN=>I think in the car.
ELLEN=>The car?
ELLEN=>On the way to the homeless shelter. You looked at my leg. Bill lost interest a long time ago.
DAVE=>That's good. I was worried it was the shower.
ELLEN=>So what do you do the rest of the time?
DAVE=>You mean when I'm not running the country?
ELLEN=>Yes.
DAVE=>I run a temp agency.
DAVE=>You know, secretaries and stiff.
ELLEN=>You find people jobs?
DAVE=>Yeah. Is that funny?
ELLEN=>It's just more than anybody else does around here.
DAVE=>Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
ELLEN=>And your family? I assume you're married?
DAVE=>I was... once. It didn't take.
ELLEN=>You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it? I can't keep all of this a secret.
DAVE=>I know.
ELLEN=>But you could go to jail for it.
DAVE=>Yeah, I know.
DAVE=>I liked doing it, though. Not the fancy stuff with the helicopter or the TV cameras but...
DAVE=>I liked saving that shelter. I liked helping people I hadn't even met before.
DAVE=>And right then I felt like I wasn't pretending anymore.
ELLEN=>I don't think you were pretending.
DAVE=>I liked being married to you.
ELLEN=>What would you do if you were still in there? If you had one more chance to be President, what would you do then?
DAVE=>Lots of things.
GUARD=>I'm sorry, sir. There's no visitors...
GUARD=>Mr. President! I'm sorry I...
DAVE=>Just getting some air.
GUARD=>Certainly, sir... How did...
ELLEN=>The President wanted some ice cream.
ELLEN=>... You make a nice President, Dave Kovic.. . go for it.
BOB=>What the hell...
REED=>I didn't call it. He called it himself... I swear to God.
GUIDE=>... Jackson is the figure that you see represented in the lower left hand... Why there's Bob Alexander our White House Chief of Staff...
GUIDE=>... My, he seems to be in quite a hurry...
BOB=>What do you think you're doing?!
DAVE=>You mean the press conference? I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
BOB=>Share...
WIDER=>Dave rises from the couch as Bob moves over to him with his eyes blazing.
BOB=>You don't call a press conference. I call a press conference!
BOB=>You're nothing. Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
DAVE=>I'm... not... nobody...
BOB=>You're lint! You're a flea! You're a blip!
DAVE=>Well, maybe I am. But you're fired.
BOB=>... what?
DAVE=>I said you're fired. Go on -- get outta here.
BOB=>Oh... I'm fired?
DAVE=>Yeah.
BOB=>You're fired.
DAVE=>Fine...
BOB=>Fine?
DAVE=>Fine.
DAVE=>You got the whole Press Corps out there. Why don't you just go tell 'em.
DAVE=>Go on. Be my guest.
CLOSER=>They stare at each other for a long moment. Neither man moves as they stand toe to toe in the center of the carpet. For a second, it isn't clear who's going to win, until...
WOMAN=>Darling...
ELLEN=>Darling, they're all waiting for you in the Press Room - - you've really got to get going... Oh, Bob... I'm sorry, darling. I thought you were alone - -
DAVE=>I'd like your resignation on my desk by the time I get back.
DAVE=>Thanks for coming on such short notice.
WIDER=>Reed stands off to the side with an almost mesmerized look on his face.
DAVE=>First, I'd like to announce something that might come as a surprise to many of you. I've asked Bob Alexander to resign as White House Chief of Staff.
DAVE=>Sometimes, two people just change and it's better for everybody if they go their Own way. Over the last few months! Bob and I have come to believe in different things. He thinks this country is fine and we should go about doing business as usual. I just don't feel that way. Not anymore.
DAVE=>Because things aren't fine. And you know that and I know that. And we can keep lying to ourselves, but it's a little late for that. We've got water we can't drink and air we can't breathe. We've got bars on. our windows and graffiti on our doors. If you get sick you can't afford to go to the doctor and if you get laid off you can't find a new job. We're trillions of dollar in debt. Our roads are cracking, our bridges are crumbling and everything we used to build is made in Japan. We've got people sleeping in cardboard boxes, and ten- year-old kids who are doing drugs. We've been living together for four hundred years, and we're still trying to kill each other... But that isn't even the worst part. The worst part is we feel like we can't do anything about it.
DAVE=>So I've decided that while I'm President, I should actually try to do things... even if they seem impossible.
DAVE=>First off I'm initiating a program to try to find a decent job for every American who wants one.
DAVE=>Why start here? Because if you've ever seen the look on someone's face the day they get a job -- I've had some personal experience with this - - they look like they could fly. And unless we start tapping into that kind of spirit again, there's no way we're gonna fix anything in this country.
DAVE=>So... Let's get to work.
REPORTERS=>Mr. President... Mr. President...
DAVE=>It was okay?
ELLEN=>It was inspirational.
NINA TOTENBERG=>In the boldest initiative yet of the `New Bill Mitchell' presidency, the President has proposed a comprehensive full employment program, unparalleled since the days of F.D.R.
NOVACK=>... It's naive, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible...
MATHEWS=>... It's courageous, it's challenging, it's visionary...
BARNES=>It's insane.
MARK SHIELDS=>It's brilliant.
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN=>If the President wants to run around proposing lame-brained schemes like this one...
MICHAEL KINSELY=>Well he's certainly got my vote.
DAVE=>Thank God for that.
DAVE=>Let's call it a night. I can't take any more.
REED=>Right. We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
ELLEN'S AIDE=>I'll have those employment figures to you by eight-thirty...
REED=>And we've got that labor briefing at nine.
DAVE=>Terrific.
DAVE=>Well I guess...
ELLEN=>Yeah... Bedtime.
DAVE=>What?
ELLEN=>I can't.
DAVE=>I know. I'm sorry...
ELLEN=>I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
DAVE=>That's okay.
ELLEN=>This is crazy...
DUANE=>The U.S. News hammered us. But they're always tough on that kind of thing. Rosenthal loved us in the Times
RANDI=>Mr. President, Mr. Nance is waiting inside for you.
DAVE=>Who?
DUANE=>The Vice-President...
DAVE=>Oh... right... You know, ever since the stroke...
NANCE=>Mr. President.
NANCE=>This is from the people of Burundi...
DAVE=>Oh... Thanks.
NANCE=>And these are a gift from the King of To go.
DAVE=>What are they?
NANCE=>Fertility beads.
DAVE=>Ah.
NANCE=>Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
DAVE=>Certainly.
NANCE=>I know we haven't always gotten along. I know we've disagreed politically and I suppose I know what you think of me personally...
NANCE=>... But I've always tried to respect the role you wanted me to play. When I've disagreed with this administration I've kept it to myself. When you wanted my support you always had it.
NANCE=>Dammit, Bill -- how could you do something like this to me?
DAVE=>Something like what...
NANCE=>Oh, come on, we're not children. I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
DAVE=>The Fidelity nonsense...
NANCE=>All I've got is my integrity. That's all I have. Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
DAVE=>They re not my attack dogs.
NANCE=>What do you mean?
DAVE=>I just fired Bob Alexander.
DAVE=>Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
DAVE=>What do you mean you made it all up?
REED=>We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
DAVE=>This is wrong, Alan!
REED=>Wrong...
DAVE=>Alan...
REED=>Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad. It's really embarrassing. But it was Bob's idea.
DAVE=>We've got to fix this.
REED=>Absolutely. Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
ELLEN=>Dave...
WIDER=>She flies into the room with a worried look on her face. Dave and Reed watch while she heads toward the "media center" in the corner.
REED=>`Dave'?
DAVE=>She knows.
ELLEN=>Look at this.
NINA TOTENBERG=>... The hastily called news conference at the National Press Club was Bob Alexander's first public comment since resigning as White House Chief of Staff. It turned out to be nothing short of a full-fledged salvo fired directly at Pennsylvania Avenue.
BOB=>When I first began to look into the allegations concerning Fidelity Savings and Loan, I thought the wrongdoing was restricted to the Vice President's office...
REED=>Uh-oh...
BOB=>... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
REED=>Jesus...
TV SCREEN=>Bob pauses for an effect, then looks straight into the camera:
BOB=>... I was saddened to discover at least fifteen separate acts of intervention by this administration, most with the full knowledge of the President and all of them illegal. Federal regulators were influenced, records were destroyed, and pressure was brought to bear, in same cases by President Mitchell himself.
DAVE=>Now he's making stuff up about me.
REED=>He's not.
DAVE=>He's not making it up.
ELLEN=>Bob never left Bill's side. He knows where all the old bones are buried...
SPEAKER=>Mr. President, I don't know another way to put it, but 'This dawg just won't hunt.'
MAJ. LEADER=>We may be able to hold off this First Liberty thing for a little while1 but if you go running around the country with this new jobs idea...
SPEAKER=>They're gonna put us on a spit an' bring in the sauce.
FEMALE SENATOR=>If you just waited for a little while...
DAVE=>I don't want to wait for a little while.
SPEAKER=>Mr. President, I understand that. But sometimes ya fight an' sometimes ya run.
ELLEN=>That's not what you said during your ethics investigation.
WIDER=>Every eye in the room turns toward her. The Speaker stares daggers across the table.
SPEAKER=>I beg your pardon?
ELLEN=>When you needed the President's help, you got it.
SPEAKER=>Ma'am, no one appreciates your husband's help more'n me. I'm just saying that this jobs thing is a little unwieldy...'
NANCE=>It is not.
NANCE=>There's lots of ways to make it work. You could have targeted tax credits for on-site training... You could have a public private partnership like - J.T.P.A...
SPEAKER=>Excuse me for interruptin' but this ain't some city council silliness that's gonna blow over. We're talking about obstructing federal regulators and violating election up on the Hill who are talkin' impeachment. We got a real problem on our hands.
BOB=>... At least fifteen separate acts of intervention by this administration, most with full knowledge of the President..
NANCE=>Guess they're coming at you now, too.
DAVE=>Oh... Hi.
NANCE=>Dirty business we're in sometimes.
DAVE=>Yeah.
NANCE=>He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
DAVE=>... Sometimes they do.
NANCE=>Yeah... Sometimes they do.
NANCE=>Mr. President, whatever happens I just wanted you to know that I think that your jobs program is a wonderful idea...
DAVE,=>Not that anyone's gonna pay much attention now... But thanks.
DAVE=>Want to sit down?
DAVE=>You ever think back to how you started.
NANCE=>What?
DAVE=>You know. Your first campaign.
NANCE=>Yeah... .. I was a shoe salesman. and not very happy about it.
NANCE=>One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office. You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?' So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break. Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
DAVE=>Really?
NANCE=>My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
NANCE=>With advertising.
NANCE=>How'd you get started?
DAVE=>Oh... Kinda the same way.
DAVE=>Hello?
DAVE=>I brought you something.
DAVE=>What's wrong?
ELLEN=>Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
ELLEN=>They're crucifying you out there.
DAVE=>Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
ELLEN=>You really believe that?
DAVE=>Yeah. And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
ELLEN=>I sure fall for some weird guys.
DAVE=>Nance is a good man, isn't he?
ELLEN=>Yeah. He's a good man.
DAVE=>What?
ELLEN=>I'm just getting to know you -- I don't want to lose you.
SLOWLY=>DISSOLVE TO:
SANDER VANOCUR=>The President has requested this rare joint session of Congress so that he could personally answer the allegations raised by Bob Alexander, his former Chief of Staff...
SANDER VANOCUR=>Speculation on the President's response has run the gamut from a full-fledged denial right up to the possibility that he might resign.
BOB=>Let's wait for the speech first. Don't want to get ahead of ourselves.
DAVE=>Is everything clear with Duane?
DAVE=>And this is all of it?
DAVE=>Well -- here we go.
DAVE=>Relax, Alan... Enjoy the moment.
SERGEANT AT ARMS=>Mr. Speaker... The President of the United States.
WIDER ANGLE=>The response is more of a murmur than the usual applause. Dave appears at the back of the Chamber carrying the black briefcase. He makes his way up the aisle and mounts the five steps that lead to the podium.
BOB=>Shhh shh... Here it comes.
DAVE=>Thank you. I wish I could be here today under different circumstances...
DAVE=>There's certainly a lot of things about this country that we should be discussing, but I realize that's not possible now. As all of you know, my former Chief of Staff has implicated me in a scandal involving Fidelity Savings and Loan.
DAVE=>... And once people start talking about scandal it's hard for them to talk about anything else.
DAVE=>So fine. Let's talk about it.
DAVE=>Bob Alexander has accused me of... Let me read this to make sure I get it right...
DAVE=>.... Illegally influencing government regulators on behalf of major campaign contributors -- interfering with an ongoing Justice Department investigation - - and violating Federal election laws in the area of campaign finance.
DAVE=>Okay -- let's get right to the guts of it... Each one of these charges is absolutely true.
BOB=>Die, you pond scum!
DAVE=>I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.' So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
DAVE=>But you see that's not the whole story, and I think each one of you is entitled to the truth.
DAVE=>I have written proof here in the form of... Notes, memoranda and personal directives' proving that Bob Alexander was involved in each one of these incidents and in most cases planned them as well...
BOB=>Alan...
DAVE=>Now - - allegations of wrong-doing have also been made against Vice President Nance... I'm afraid that's just a lie.
DAVE=>... As this evidence will show... At no time and in no way was Vice President Nance involved in any of this affair. Bob made all of that up.
DAVE=>Vice president Nance is a good and decent public servant and I'd like to apologize for any pain this may have caused him or his family. And while we're setting the record straight, I'd also like to apologize to the American people...
DAVE=>... I forgot that I was hired to do a job for you and that it was just a temp job at that. I forgot that I had two hundred and fifty million people who were paying me to make their lives a little better and I didn't live up to my part of the bargain.
DAVE=>See, there are certain things you should expect from a President. I ought to care more about you than I do about me... I ought to care more about what's right than I do about what's popular...
DAVE=>I ought to be willing to give this whole thing up for something I believe in...
DAVE=>Because if I'm not...
DAVE=>If I'm not...
