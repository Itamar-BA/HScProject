HOODED MAN'S VOICE=>Vieira...
VIEIRA=>How comes it your are not afraid?
HOODED MAN=>Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
HOODED MAN=>I've come to strike a bargain with you. I wish to learn the power of changing.
VIEIRA=>And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
HOODED MAN=>Your life.
VIEIRA=>How?
HOODED MAN=>I have a magic of my own.
HOODED MAN=>Teach me the chant and I will take your place on the gallows.
VIEIRA=>After you recite the chant you must concentrate of the form you wish to take. The stonger you are the longer you can hold the illusion.
VIEIRA=>They come. Quickly, take my place.
RELIGIOUS MAN=>What are you doing here?
HOODED MAN=>Just saying goodbye to an old friend.
VIEIRA=>We had a bargain. You promised.
HOODED MAN=>I lied.
OLD MAN=>It's over.
OLD MAN=>Your anger blinds you. You must learn to control it. When the time comes you'll only have but one chance. You best use it well.
OLD MAN=>Where are you off to?
YOUNG MAN=>To the village for some ale -- and if the truth be known, I need to see someones face other than yours, old man.
OLD MAN=>Kilvara...
KILVARA=>It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
OLD MAN=>It's not been long enough. What witchcraft is this?
KILVARA=>Impressive -- is it not? The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes. I need more power to hold the form longer. I need the Highlander. Where is he?
OLD MAN=>I do not know -- and even if I did...
KILVARA=>I know. I know-- you would not tell me. Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me. Oh well -- I shall find him. Time is on my side.
KILVARA=>Is this what you're looking for?
KILVARA=>Oh -- I almost forgot. Your head.
OLD MAN=>It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
KILVARA=>Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
KILVARA=>You're dead.
KILVARA=>There can be only one.
PUNK=>What'cha got in the bag?
PUNK=>Hey -- you hear me?
MACLEOD=>Yes -- I hear you.
PUNK=>Good. Now, give it up.
MACLEOD=>Go home -- while you still can.
PUNK=>What do you think you're gonna to do with that?
MACLEOD=>Let's find out.
MACLEOD=>Rachel.
RACHEL=>You know it's not safe here for you.
MACLEOD=>I know.
RACHEL=>The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
MACLEOD=>I can take care of myself.
RACHEL=>Why are you here, Conner? After seven years without a word, why have you come back? You went off to make a new life with Brenda and that was the last I heard--
MACLEOD=>Brenda's dead.
MACLEOD=>Four years ago. I've nowhere else to go. You're all I have, Rachel -- and I'm just so tired of being alone.
RACHEL=>It isn't over, is it, Conner?
MACLEOD=>No.
RACHEL=>How can that be?
MACLEOD=>I don't know.
RACHEL=>Is there anything else you need?
MACLEOD=>No -- I'm fine. Thank you.
RACHEL=>I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
MACLEOD=>Me too.
FARMER=>It will be a good harvest this year.
MCCLEOD=>Can you really tell from doing that?
FARMER=>What do you think?
MCCLEOD=>I think you just like to eat dirt.
SARAH=>Would you care for some water, Conner?
MCCLEOD=>Aye -- that I would, lass.
FARMER=>I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
MCCLEOD=>She's a treasure she is.
FARMER=>She'll soon be of age.
MCCLEOD=>Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
FARMER=>I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
FARMER=>Good day.
FARMER=>You are welcome to share our food and our fire.
FARMER=>No!
FARMER=>This cannot be.
MCCLEOD=>It is. Do not ask me how. I do not know. I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
FARMER=>Agreed.
MCCLEOD=>I would like to say goodbye.
FARMER=>How?
FARMER=>Be quick -- he has not much time.
SARAH=>Don't leave us, Conner.
MCCLEOD=>It's not for me to decide.
MCCLEOD=>Don't cry, wee one. It's a better place I go to.
SARAH=>I love you, Conner.
MCCLEOD=>Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
SARAH=>I'll no forget you.
MCCLEOD=>And I you. Go now. Let me walk to heavens door alone.
FARMER=>This should do.
FARMER=>Go. I will dig a grave and mark it with your name.
MCCLEOD=>Thank you.
FARMER=>Conner?
FARMER=>I will not pretend to understand what I have seen this day. I am a simple man. Whatever you be -- demon or spirit -- I thank you for the life of my Sarah and I wish you God's peace.
MACLEOD=>The forest is lovely. Dark and deep -- but I have promises to keep -- and miles to go before I sleep.
MACLEOD=>"Miles to go before I sleep"
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>For years this site was thought to hold no archaeological value. That is until a few weeks ago when some local boys discovered what appears to be a collapsed passageway that leads into a cavern.
REPORTER=>How much longer until you expect to enter the main cavern?
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>That's what we're going to find out now.
REPORTER=>I've never seen anything like that before.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>It just started a few hours ago.
JENNIFER=>Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
REPORTER=>Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
JENNIFER=>Huge.
REPORTER=>What are you hoping to find inside?
JENNIFER=>You guys are from the British museum, right?
REPORTER=>No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries. It's a syndicated show out of..
JENNIFER=>Paul. I thought we agreed. No press.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>Just a little. Who knows what we're going to find in there. It could be a huge excavation. A little friendly PR never hurt.
JENNIFER=>Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
JENNIFER=>Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning. This could be a very important find. I want it documented.
KILVARA=>Can you feel it? There is another one among us. It has not ended?
KILVARA=>Everything is as it was before.
MAN'S VOICE=>Good day.
CAVANAUGH=>You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
MCCLEOD=>Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
CAVANAUGH=>Caution shows wisdom.
CAVANAUGH=>I know that weapon. It belonged to Juan Romeriz. He's dead?
MCCLEOD=>Aye.
CAVANAUGH=>You?
MCCLEOD=>No. He was my brother. He died at anothers hand.
CAVANAUGH=>We too are brothers, Macleod. In fact, you have more family than you think.
MCCLEOD=>Who are you?
CAVANAUGH=>Thomas Cavenaugh. I am a teacher of sorts. Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
MCCLEOD=>I learned my fill from Romeriz.
CAVANAUGH=>Indeed you did. And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
MCCLEOD=>So they can take my head?
CAVANAUGH=>Your head is not important, Highlander. What is important is the prize. It must go to one who would not misuse it. Ride with me. Come and meet your family.
CAVANAUGH=>I've called this gathering on holy ground so that each man might take comfort in knowing he is protected inside the confines of these walls. None of us, good or evil would dare raise a hand against the other in God's house.
CAVANAUGH=>God's purpose for us is unclear, save that he has given us a gift.
CAVANAUGH=>I do not profess to know what is in God's mind. He has chosen us. We are his warriors through time. The final Gathering is still far away but the prize must be captured by a man who is pure of heart. Those of us who would use the prize for goodly purpose must band together against those who would use it for evil.
MCCLEOD=>The prize? So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again. So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children. The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
CAVANAUGH=>There will be more to the prize than that. Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
MCCLEOD=>The days of magic are ending. The world is changing.
CAVANAUGH=>Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change. Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon. They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
MCCLEOD=>I grow weary of the fight.
CAVANAUGH=>You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
MCCLEOD=>Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>What's going on? Where is everyone?
JENNIFER=>We're holding the workers down below.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>Why?
JENNIFER=>Someone broke into the cavern last night.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>What? How?
JENNIFER=>We're not quite sure. The Guard was knocked out.
JENNIFER=>He's fine. He swears he never left his post for a moment. He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>How could they get by him?
JENNIFER=>I don't know.
JENNIFER=>We found him this morning.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>What's that next to him?
JENNIFER=>His head. Someone cut it off.
JENNIFER=>Look at this.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>Incredible. The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds. It's a remarkable duplication.
JENNIFER=>I don't think it is a duplication.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>It has to be.
JENNIFER=>And this?
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>Same period -- and exceptionally well preserved. Jennifer, what's going on here?
JENNIFER=>That's a good question. That's a very good question.
MCCLEOD=>I'm going out for a while.
MCCLEOD=>You kept it?
RACHEL=>Yes.
PRIEST=>You look troubled my son.
PRIEST=>Sometimes we feel better if we talk about the things that bother us. How long has it been since your last confession?
MCCLEOD=>A long time.
PRIEST=>Perhaps if you--
MCCLEOD=>I don't think confession will help me, father.
PRIEST=>Redemption is one of God's gifts.
MCCLEOD=>God's gifts? You mean like, life, having children, growing old, dying and heaven?
PRIEST=>Exactly.
MCCLEOD=>Those are gifts I can never have.
PRIEST=>You are too young to be so bitter.
MCCLEOD=>I'm older than I look.
MCCLEOD=>Wait. We don't have to do this.
MCCLEOD=>Alright.
MCCLEOD=>Must you do that?
CAVANAUGH=>What?
MCCLEOD=>Sing.
CAVANAUGH=>It is a beautiful day. I am merely enjoying it.
MCCLEOD=>Can't you enjoy it quietly?
CAVANAUGH=>Are you always this pleasant? You know what you're problem is?
MCCLEOD=>You?
CAVANAUGH=>Life. You've stopped living it. You look, but you do not see. You listen but, you do not hear.
MCCLEOD=>I hear you.
CAVANAUGH=>What else? What else do you hear right now?
MCCLEOD=>The river.
CAVANAUGH=>That's all?
MCCLEOD=>Yes.
CAVANAUGH=>Do you not hear the wind in the trees? The songs of the birds. The horses breath? There is a whole world around you. Alive. Living. Feel it -- become part of it. Live your life, Highlander. It's going to be a long one.
MCCLEOD=>That is what bothers me.
CAVANAUGH=>I see. You don't care about life anymore.
MCCLEOD=>I guess not.
CAVANAUGH=>You protect yourself well for a man who doesn't care if he lives or dies.
CAVANAUGH=>Fear not, my friend -- we're all going to die. It's just going to take us longer, that's all.
MCCLEOD=>I'm leaving.
CAVANAUGH=>Leaving what?
MCCLEOD=>England. There is nothing for me here anymore.
CAVANAUGH=>And what do you think you will find in another land?
MCCLEOD=>Maybe myself.
CAVANAUGH=>Then it's worth the journey.
MCCLEOD=>Thank you, Thomas.
CAVANAUGH=>For what?
MCCLEOD=>For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
CAVANAUGH=>I'm sure they will.
MCCLEOD=>As friends -- always as friends.
CAVANAUGH=>We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
MCCLEOD=>That is a thought that doesn't please me.
CAVANAUGH=>If it came down to it what would you do?
MCCLEOD=>I do not know. I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>Caretaker found him this morning. He's got no I.D. on him -- we'll have to run his prints.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>So, whaddaya think, Lieutenant, U.S.D.A?
BEDSOE=>Did you find a sword? An old sword?
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>Yeah -- how'd you know that?
BEDSOE=>He's back.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>You stayed here again last night?
JENNIFER=>I was working on the cataloging.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
JENNIFER=>I know, Paul.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>Do you? Then why don't you go out? Meet someone. Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
JENNIFER=>I like my work.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
JENNIFER=>We'll see.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>Take a lok at this.
JENNIFER=>The headless corpse of a man was found early this morning in a meat packing warehouse near the river. Police say the unidentified body was dressed in what appears to be a costume from the seventeenth century...
KILVARA=>Don't get up.
TELLER=>Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
MR. PARKER=>Good afternoon... ... Shirley.
TELLER=>Would you like to deposit this in your account?
MR. PARKER=>No. The money, please.
TELLER=>This check is for sixteen thousand dollars. That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
MR. PARKER=>I can take care of myself.
TELLER=>Alright. It's going to take a few minutes. I have to call and verify the funds.
TELLER=>Yes -- I'll hold.
MR. PARKER=>That's okay -- I trust you.
GUARD=>Just a moment, Sir.
GUARD=>Would you come with me please?
KILVARA=>I think not.
GUARD=>Freeze!
KILVARA=>That hurt.
RACHEL=>What are you doing?
MCCLEOD=>I shouldn't have come back here. It was a mistake.
RACHEL=>Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
MCCLEOD=>Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
RACHEL=>Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
MCCLEOD=>Because no one can.
MAN'S VOICE=>Hello, Nash.
MCCLEOD=>Detective Bedsoe.
BEDSOE=>Lieutenant.
MCCLEOD=>Congratulations.
BEDSOE=>Guess what we found this morning?
BEDSOE=>A body -- with it's head cut off. Sound familiar?
BEDSOE=>When did you get back?
MCCLEOD=>A few days ago.
BEDSOE=>That's what I figured. Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
BEDSOE=>I've been waiting seven years for this.
BEDSOE=>Where were you last night around nine?
MCCLEOD=>I already told you. I took a walk.
BEDSOE=>Tell me again. Where'd you go?
MCCLEOD=>Central Park.
BEDSOE=>Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
MCCLEOD=>No. I don't scare easy.
BEDSOE=>Where have you been for the last seven years?
MCCLEOD=>Around.
BEDSOE=>And Brenda?
BEDSOE=>How?
BEDSOE=>She was a good woman.
MCCLEOD=>You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
BEDSOE=>No.
BEDSOE=>I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
MCCLEOD=>No.
BEDSOE=>You sure?
MCCLEOD=>He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
BEDSOE=>I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
CAPTAIN=>Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
BEDSOE=>What?
CAPTAIN=>Cut him loose. The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
BEDSOE=>You don't understand. About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey. A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley. The fourth body we've never been able to identify. All four men died from decapitation. Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
CAPTAIN=>It's circumstantial.
BEDSOE=>For Chrissake! Gimme a break. The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
CAPTAIN=>I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view. There's something missing here. It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career. It's called evidence. Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it. Find me an eye witness. Dig up a motive. Until then we don't have a case against him.
BEDSOE=>This isn't over Nash. It's just beginning.
JENNIFER=>Lieutenant Bedsoe?
BEDSOE=>Not now. I'm busy.
BEDSOE=>I'm gonna nail you, Nash. That's a promise.
MCCLEOD=>Is that it?
BEDSOE=>No. I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
MCCLEOD=>Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
BEDSOE=>Get outta here.
MCCLEOD=>I'm going to Jimmy's Bar on West sixty seventh for drink. See you there.
JENNIFER=>Lieutenant?
BEDSOE=>What? Who are you? What do you want?
JENNIFER=>My name is Jennifer Hillman. I'm an archaeologist. I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
BEDSOE=>Talk to me about what?
JENNIFER=>About this.
MEDICAL EXAMINER=>Well, it wasn't easy but I finally determined the cause of death.
BEDSOE=>What else?
MEDICAL EXAMINER=>Nothing. Besides not having a head he's in perfect health. No cavities. No broken bones. Have you found out who he is?
BEDSOE=>He's nobody. The police, the F.B.I, Interpol -- nobody has record of this guy. It's like he was never born.
JENNIFER=>That's exactly what Scotland Yard said about the person we found at the site.
BEDSOE=>What do you think?
JENNIFER=>They appear to be authentic.
BEDSOE=>Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
JENNIFER=>Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
BEDSOE=>Whatever -- it's old clothing, right? This is some weird shit.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
BEDSOE=>What is it?
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank. It was robbed this morning.
BEDSOE=>Really? I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley. A crime was committed in New York City? That is news.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>That's not all, Lieutenant. Wait until you see the tape. It's unbelievable.
BEDSOE=>I'd like you to see this.
ROBBERY DETECTIVE=>Watch this part.
BEDSOE=>What the hell. What is this? A joke?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE=>No joke, Lieutenant.
BEDSOE=>Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE=>Parker. We found him knocked out in the can.
BEDSOE=>If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE=>Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
BEDSOE=>Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE=>You can believe what you want. You saw the tape.
BEDSOE=>You didn't see this. Understand?
JENNIFER=>Yes.
BEDSOE=>Let me worry about Nash.
MAN'S VOICE=>You're going to fall over you damn fool.
MCCLEOD=>Thomas. What are you doing here?
CAVANAUGH=>You didn't think I'd let you go off by yourself, did you?
MCCLEOD=>You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
CAVANAUGH=>The sea and I don't agree with each other. Where we off to?
MCCLEOD=>France.
CAVANAUGH=>How long is the voyage?
MCCLEOD=>Not long. We should arrive in the morning. Are you going to be alright?
CAVANAUGH=>Me? Of course.
CAVANAUGH=>Oh, Lord have mercy.
MCCLEOD=>Oh no.
GASTON=>Excuse me gentlemen. My name is Gaston.
CAVANAUGH=>What'd he say?
MCCLEOD=>I have no idea.
GASTON=>Ah, you are English. I speak English. My name is Gaston. For a small fee I would gladly be your guide.
CAVANAUGH=>We need food and lodging.
GASTON=>Not to worry, Monsieur. My Uncle owns a very reputable inn.
GASTON=>How was journey?
MCCLEOD=>Great. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to lose weight.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>Here it is, Lieutenant. We blew it up off the tape. Every cop in the city has a copy of it.
BEDSOE=>Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset. We're stepping on their toes of this one.
BEDSOE=>Tough.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
BEDSOE=>This ties in with Nash.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>We don't have any proof of that.
BEDSOE=>I don't need proof. I know it. Send it out.
JENNIFER=>Russell Nash Antiques. Hudson street.
JENNIFER=>Mr. Nash?
JENNIFER=>My name is Jennifer Hillman. I was at the police station earlier today--
MCCLEOD=>I remember you.
JENNIFER=>I was wondering if I could talk to you?
MCCLEOD=>Are you a cop?
JENNIFER=>No. I'm an archaeologist.
MCCLEOD=>What do you want?
JENNIFER=>To talk to you.
MCCLEOD=>I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
JENNIFER=>Not even headless corpses wearing seventeenth century clothing?
MCCLEOD=>Corpses?
JENNIFER=>Yes. We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
MCCLEOD=>In the highlands?
JENNIFER=>Yes. How did you know?
MCCLEOD=>A lucky guess.
JENNIFER=>I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
MCCLEOD=>He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
JENNIFER=>Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
MCCLEOD=>You got me.
JENNIFER=>Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
MCCLEOD=>Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
JENNIFER=>If it's good advice.
MCCLEOD=>This is. Go home. Stay out of this.
JENNIFER=>Why? What's going on?
MCCLEOD=>Where did you get this ring?
MCCLEOD=>Where did you get it?
JENNIFER=>It's mine. It's been in my family for years. It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
MCCLEOD=>Goodnight, Miss Hillman.
RACHEL=>I heard voices downstairs. Is everything alright?
MCCLEOD=>Fine.
RACHEL=>What will you do?
MCCLEOD=>There's nothing I can do. I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
CAVANAUGH=>What are we doing here?
MCCLEOD=>Living. Remember?
CAVANAUGH=>You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
MCCLEOD=>She's beautiful.
CAVANAUGH=>Where are you going?
MCCLEOD=>To ask her to dance.
CAVANAUGH=>She's the King's cousin.
MCCLEOD=>Then she should be an excellent dancer.
ISABELLE=>Conner?
MCCLEOD=>Aye?
ISABELLE=>Where do you go when your mind drifts?
MCCLEOD=>Different places.
ISABELLE=>The past?
MCCLEOD=>Sometimes.
ISABELLE=>Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
MCCLEOD=>Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
ISABELLE=>And will I be part of your past or your future?
MCCLEOD=>Something wrong?
CAVANAUGH=>Yes.
MCCLEOD=>What worries you?
CAVANAUGH=>You.
CAVANAUGH=>You've been seeing her for over a month now. Have you learned nothing from the past?
MCCLEOD=>I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
CAVANAUGH=>So, you do this for yourself? What about her? You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod. You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen. You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
CAVANAUGH=>That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart. Would you live that pain again?
MCCLEOD=>No. What am I to do?
CAVANAUGH=>The only thing you can do. You must end it.
GASTON=>This is a most dangerous undertaking. These are part of the royal apartments.
ISABELLE=>Conner.
MCCLEOD=>Hello, blossom.
MCCLEOD=>I cannot stay.
ISABELLE=>Why not?
MCCLEOD=>I'm leaving in the morning.
ISABELLE=>Leaving? For how long?
MCCLEOD=>You'll no see me again.
ISABELLE=>Why?
MCCLEOD=>I cannot explain.
ISABELLE=>Do you love me, Conner?
MCCLEOD=>Aye.
ISABELLE=>Then take me with you.
MCCLEOD=>Where I'm going you cannot follow.
ISABELLE=>Why are you doing this?
MCCLEOD=>Because, it's for the best. There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
MCCLEOD=>Take this -- and whenever you look at it, remember that it came from one who loved you.
ISABELLE=>I wanted to grow old with you -- to have your children.
MCCLEOD=>I know, but that can never be, and that's the sorrow if it.
CAVANAUGH=>Well?
MCCLEOD=>It's done.
GUARD=>What is your business here?
GASTON=>Just taking in some night air, Captain.
GUARD=>Corporal. This is the King's cousins apartment. Come with us.
CAVANAUGH=>We've done nothing wrong.
GUARD=>That's what we'll decide.
MCCLEOD=>I think not.
GASTON=>We have permission. I'll show you.
MCCLEOD=>Go.
MCCLEOD=>I said, go!
GUARD=>Sentence has been passed on you.
CAVANAUGH=>What is it?
GUARD=>There is only for attacking the King's guards. Death. You will both be executed immediately. Which one of you shall go first?
CAVANAUGH=>I'll go first.
MCCLEOD=>No -- I will.
CAVANAUGH=>I stood up first.
MCCLEOD=>That doesn't matter.
CAVANAUGH=>You always get to go first.
GUARD=>You will both go. You will go first. And you will watch.
CAVANAUGH=>What is this?
GUARD=>It's a guillotine.
MACLEOD=>What does it do?
GUARD=>It cuts your head off.
MCCLEOD=>You can go first.
CAVANAUGH=>No -- after you.
MACLEOD=>Don't you have anything else? Can't you hang us -- or shoot us?
CAVANAUGH=>Shooting's good. I would much rather be shot. This has to be awfully messy.
GUARD=>Take him.
MCCLEOD=>No!
GUARD=>Bring him.
JENNIFER=>Look out!
KILVARA=>Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
MCCLEOD=>This cannot be.
KILVARA=>I am stronger than you, Highlander.
MCCLEOD=>That's what the Kurgan said.
KILVARA=>The Kurgan was a pussy.
KILVARA=>Why prolong the inevitable?
KILVARA=>Fine -- I've waited over three centuries. I can wait a little longer.
MCCLEOD=>Why did you wait?
KILVARA=>It was not by choice. A small matter of a mountain falling down on us. We were trapped inside. When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands. What you thought was the end -- was not. This is the end. We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
MCCLEOD=>It will not end tonight.
KILVARA=>You cannot hide from me. You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want. Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want. The world will be mine.
KILVARA=>Remember, Macleod -- the next time you see me -- you won't see me.
JENNIFER=>I don't believe what I just saw.
MCCLEOD=>That's probably the smartest thing.
JENNIFER=>You're hurt.
MCCLEOD=>I'll be fine.
JENNIFER=>What's going on? Why did he call you Macleod?
MCCLEOD=>Because it's my name.
JENNIFER=>Then who's Russell Nash?
MCCLEOD=>I don't know anymore.
MCCLEOD=>I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
RACHEL=>Why?
MCCLEOD=>I don't know. He is the stronger one. He has a power--
RACHEL=>You also have a power, Conner. It is why you have survived.
RACHEL=>Heart.
RACHEL=>Do not underestimate the power of your heart. Your dreams live there.
MCCLEOD=>My dreams died long ago.
RACHEL=>Did they? You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man. You feel the same -- want the same. You want to live.
MCCLEOD=>I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it. I've existed in the shadows.
RACHEL=>And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
MCCLEOD=>Dear, sweet, Rachel. Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
RACHEL=>If you search your heart you know all the good you have done. Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just. This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made. And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
PROSTITUTE=>Please, sir -- you're frightening me.
MAN=>Good.
MAN=>Conner -- what an unexpected surprise.
MCCLEOD=>Let her go.
MAN=>I'm afraid I can't do that. Just let me kill her and then we can attend to our business.
MCCLEOD=>When you make your thrust at her I'll take your head. It's her or me.
MAN=>Oh dear me -- I do so hate decisions.
CONSTABLE=>Dear mother of God.
MCCLEOD=>Goodbye -- Jack.
BEDSOE=>Anything from the bank?
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
BEDSOE=>He had to come from somewhere.
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>I think it was England.
BEDSOE=>Why?
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank. Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
BEDSOE=>So?
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>So -- the only thing that was taken was his passport. I checked with immigration -- he returned to New York ten days ago -- but our embassy in London says he is still there.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>I was going through some of my mythology books last night. I think you'd get a kick out of this.
MCCLEOD=>You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
JENNIFER=>Jennifer.
JENNIFER=>Why do you stare at me like that?
MCCLEOD=>You remind me of someone I used to know.
JENNIFER=>Same story -- same questions.
MCCLEOD=>I don't have any answers for you.
JENNIFER=>Who was that man last night?
MCCLEOD=>I don't know.
JENNIFER=>Then how did he know your name?
JENNIFER=>Do you always walk around with a sword?
MCCLEOD=>New York is dangerous place.
JENNIFER=>You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions. I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
MCCLEOD=>About what?
JENNIFER=>It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
MCCLEOD=>I'm interested in mythology.
JENNIFER=>Have you ever heard of the Calan?
MCCLEOD=>No.
JENNIFER=>You look like you have.
MCCLEOD=>Do you like Italian food?
JENNIFER=>Yes.
MCCLEOD=>Meet me Tratino's at nine.
JENNIFER=>Why?
MCCLEOD=>I told you I'm interested in mythology. We can talk about it more.
KILVARA=>I would like to purchase a new jacket.
KILVARA=>It looks a bit small.
SALESMAN=>The tapered look is in.
KILVARA=>I need a lot of room. Sometimes I carry things under my coat.
KILVARA=>Freeze. A popular expression.
BEDSOE=>What happened?
SALESMAN=>They shot him. I saw it. They shot him and he got right back up.
BEDSOE=>Is this the guy?
SALESMAN=>Yes.
KILVARA=>You cannot hide from me, Macleod.
MCCLEOD=>Good evening.
JENNIFER=>You're twenty minutes late.
MCCLEOD=>Sorry.
JENNIFER=>Does this ring mean something to you?
MCCLEOD=>Glenmorganie -- no ice and...?
JENNIFER=>The house red.
JENNIFER=>You didn't answer my question.
MCCLEOD=>I know.
JENNIFER=>You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
MCCLEOD=>Why?
JENNIFER=>I'm just trying to place you.
MCCLEOD=>I've lived all over the world.
JENNIFER=>You're not an easy person to get to know.
MCCLEOD=>Why? Because I don't give up all my secrets?
JENNIFER=>How come you wanted to meet tonight?
MCCLEOD=>I wanted to get to know you better.
MCCLEOD=>That makes you uncomfortable?
JENNIFER=>A little -- yes. My interest in coming here is profession.
MCCLEOD=>Is it?
JENNIFER=>Yes -- it is.
MCCLEOD=>Alright. In the shop you mentioned something about--
JENNIFER=>--the Calan. Do you know who they are?
MCCLEOD=>Why don't you tell me.
JENNIFER=>They were called different things by different cultures. The Celts called them the Sourans. The Druids called them the Calans. According to the mythology they were spirits, sent to earth and reborn -- some good -- some evil -- both immortal.
MACLEOD=>Immortal?
JENNIFER=>Yes. They do not age and they cannot die -- unless their head is cut from their body.
JENNIFER=>Then the spirit is released and the power is absorbed by the Calan who severs it.
MACLEOD=>Very interesting. I bet kids love you at bedtime.
JENNIFER=>Maybe you can explain what I saw the other night?
MCCLEOD=>Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
JENNIFER=>No.
MCCLEOD=>Why not?
JENNIFER=>Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
MCCLEOD=>You don't really believe this do you?
JENNIFER=>Let me ask you something else. At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed. The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section. What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
MCCLEOD=>So?
JENNIFER=>Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern? They were wedged in tight. They couldn't get a grip on them. They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
MCCLEOD=>If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
JENNIFER=>Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't? What if they were trying to get out?
MCCLEOD=>That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
JENNIFER=>--for three hundred years.
MCCLEOD=>How could that be? People don't live for three hundred years.
JENNIFER=>Not unless they're immortal.
MCCLEOD=>You're very smart for someone who has not even lived a single lifetime. Maybe too smart.
JENNIFER=>What did you mean a single lifetime? Are you saying that it's true?
MCCLEOD=>May I come in?
MCCLEOD=>You asked me earlier if that ring meant something to me -- it does. It reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
JENNIFER=>Would you like to see it?
MCCLEOD=>I've seen it.
JENNIFER=>On the back it has--
MCCLEOD=>--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word: Courage.
JENNIFER=>How did you know that?
MCCLEOD=>It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried. The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
JENNIFER=>You?
MCCLEOD=>Yes.
MCCLEOD=>I was born into the clan Macleod, five hundred years ago in Glenfinnan -- on the shores of Loch Shiel.
MCCLEOD=>I've wandered the world ever since then. I cannot die.
MCCLEOD=>You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
JENNIFER=>And the other one -- he is like you?
MCCLEOD=>He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me. We are the last of our kind. The last of the Calans. I do not know what purpose we were put here for. I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
JENNIFER=>Where will you go now?
MCCLEOD=>It will end tonight.
JENNIFER=>Must you fight him?
MCCLEOD=>He will not stop until it is over.
MCCLEOD=>Good evening, Lieutenant.
BEDSOE=>No -- it isn't. A cop died today and the other is barely holding on. I want some answers, Nash.
MCCLEOD=>I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
BEDSOE=>That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on. You're connected to this guy somehow. He's after you -- just like the others were.
MCCLEOD=>It's late.
BEDSOE=>Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords. One cut off the others head. He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
MCCLEOD=>Maybe he was a lousy shot.
BEDSOE=>Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
MCCLEOD=>Most people are afraid of death.
BEDSOE=>Most people can die.
MCCLEOD=>If you really believe that you'll pull the trigger.
KILVARA'S VOICE=>Can you come out and play?
KILVARA'S VOICE=>No? You know, some people think that I don't have any good qualities, but that isn't true. I saw you tonight with your little friend -- I let you say goodbye to her. I think of it as letting a condemned prisoner have his last request. Besides, I have her now.
MCCLEOD=>She isn't part of this.
KILVARA'S VOICE=>She is now. We're at the museum. I figured we'd have more room for our business here. If you hurry you might get here before I kill her.
JENNIFER=>He's here!
JENNIFER=>He's in there!
MCCLEOD=>Get out.
JENNIFER=>Be careful, Conner.
MCCLEOD=>Conner?
MCCLEOD=>I never told her my first name.
KILVARA=>Clever -- don't you think. You can save her. All you have to do is blow out the candle. Of course, you have to get past me to do it.
KILVARA=>Now, you die.
BEDSOE=>You...
KILVARA=>I know -- freeze.
MCCLEOD=>Bedsoe -- he isn't dead!
KILVARA=>Now -- we finish it.
MCCLEOD=>Yes.
MCCLEOD=>There can be only one.
JENNIFER=>Is it over.
MCCLEOD=>Yes -- I think it is.
BEDSOE=>Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
DETECTIVE GRELEY=>Lieutenant -- what about him?
BEDSOE=>What about him?
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI=>Should I take him in?
BEDSOE=>No -- it was self defense.
BEDSOE=>Well, we gonna wait here for my bones to heal -- or you gonna take me to the hospital?
JENNIFER=>What now?
MCCLEOD=>Now I can start to live. To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
JENNIFER=>Sounds very -- normal.
MCCLEOD=>Yes -- yes it does.
