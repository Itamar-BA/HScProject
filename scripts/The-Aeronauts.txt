JAMES GLAISHER=>We only need the sky to hold for ninety minutes - once we’re above the cloud line, it will be fine.
JAMES GLAISHER=>You’re incredibly late.
JOHN TREW=>God speed, old man.
JAMES GLAISHER=>Well, I’m not finding it particularly entertaining.
AMELIA WREN=>Oh, well done Posey! Well done.
ARTHUR GLAISHER=>Many more think you are.
JAMES GLAISHER=>Would you listen to that?
ANTONIA=>No. You did not.
AMELIA WREN=>I dislike that title.
JAMES GLAISHER=>She is apparently worth thousands of pounds a year. I am trapped here, just as you.
JAMES GLAISHER=>I need to make studies of the air and I need to be in the air
AMELIA WREN=>Perhaps that you don’t have an invitation for tonight’s events. Would that be a fair presumption?
JAMES GLAISHER=>He was right! The fool was right!
AMELIA WREN=>He’d have liked these. Pierre.
JAMES GLAISHER=>May I give you a tour -
JAMES GLAISHER=>Pa. Pa. It’s me. James.
ARTHUR GLAISHER=>My son is ten years old.
CHARLES GREEN=>Find another madman to get in a balloon with. Perhaps the French. Or better yet - give up!
AMELIA WREN=>Have we slowed? Are we not at
AMELIA WREN=>You’re insufferable.
JAMES GLAISHER=>- with every layer of air we’re travelling closer to the sun. The findings we’re still to discover could be overwhelming.
AMELIA WREN=>- you are freezing -
JAMES GLAISHER=>There is nothing more mysterious, nor more beautiful, than the stars in the sky, and look at us, we’re dancing amongst them.
AMELIA WREN=>These are beautiful.
AMELIA WREN=>Concentrate now, think. Think.
JAMES GLAISHER=>I’m so sorry. I really am
AUNT FRANCES=>So we pray for silence?
JAMES GLAISHER=>I have been insensible.
AMELIA WREN=>I was busy elsewhere.
JAMES GLAISHER=>That has no great use either. The readings on our descent will be less - significant.
JAMES GLAISHER=>The same speed as - snow?
AMELIA WREN=>And if I help you....
