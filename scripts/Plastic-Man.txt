GUARD=>Something wrong, Dr. Bright?
LITTERBUG=>You better quit pushing me, pal.
SUSAN=>They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
SIM=>One big muther of a mouse.
ARGON=>Grab him! Hurry! Grab him!
SIM=>Good morning, Mr. O'Brien!
O'BRIEN=>What? I'm not going anywhere!
SIM=>This is going to take some explaining.
O'BRIEN=>Oh God, please! This can't be happening! I can't be plastic! A plastic man?!
O'BRIEN=>Oh yeah, real funny. Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
SUSAN=>You have no one to blame but yourself.
SUSAN=>Victim my ass! You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage! Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
NEBBLEMAN=>With enough exposure, it appears they can bond to anything.
O'BRIEN=>What did you want my hair for?
O'BRIEN=>'In brightest day, nor darkest night. No evil shall escape my sight.'
SUSAN=>Lemonade. Do you want some?
NEBBLEMAN=>They're here! They're here! We have the nanobot.
SUSAN=>Is that what Argon told you?
SUSAN=>You mean the designs for the nanobot? You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
O'BRIEN=>He'll never know what hit him.
SIM=>Just try it! Come on! Do something. Move. Anything. Anything! Just twitch, blink, I dare you! I double dare you!
ARGON=>You don't have to leave, Mr. O'Brien. We've prepared a wonderful room for you. I think you'll find it quite comfortable, so comfortable, in fact, I doubt you'll ever want to leave.
ARGON=>Can you feel it, Poppy? The presence of the moment? Can you feel the weight of its significance?
POPPY=>Okay, arms up, lean forward.
ARGON=>Poppy, this is not the time!
SPENCER=>Hey, what's up with the fence?
POPPY=>It's not going to take long.
NEBBLEMAN=>This is all your fault, Susan...
O'BRIEN=>We were different people then.
