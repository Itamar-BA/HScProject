JONS=>sings even louder.
JONS.=>It is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth.
MIA=>Whom did you see?
JOF=>What do you mean?
DEATH=>You want guarantees?
JONS=>ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the path towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and almost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when no one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft object. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying with her face to the ground.
KNIGHT=>He's big for his age.
KNIGHT=>Is that your husband?
KNIGHT=>I have dull company.
MIA=>points with her spoon.
KNIGHT=>smiles.
TYAN=>Fourteen, my lord.
TYAN=>moans weakly, as if she were far away.
KNIGHT=>steps up and leans over her.
PLOG=>There, over there!
SKAT=>immediately takes to his heels. PLOG chases him, swinging his sledge and bellowing like a wild boar.
DEATH=>Shame on you, Skat!
KNIGHT=>I didn't notice that.
MIA=>One can't do that.
KNIGHT=>and the chess game. She holds her son in her arms. Now JOF returns.
KARIN=>sits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book.
