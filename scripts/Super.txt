FRANK=>The other, I was downtown.
MOMENTS LATER=>Jacques is sitting at the table across from Frank, shoveling eggs into his piehole. Frank examines him.
MOMENTS LATER=>He finds a single hairpin in one of her empty drawers.
LATER=>Frank is on his knees on the floor, SOBBING. The two perfect moments are on the wall beside him. He looks up at his own distorted face in a full-length mirror.
RUN THE CREDITS!=>A DRIVING POP SONG plays over ANIMATED CREDITS: they're a version of Frank's colored-pencil cartoons on lined paper, featuring Frank in a superhero costume. He shoots beams out of his eyes. He picks up getaway cars, crunching them in his hands. He tears off criminals' heads. He stretches and flies and blows powerful winds that tear the flesh off villains, leaving them skeletons -- Ha! It's all very triumphant.
FRANK=>Can you arrest him?
MOMENTS LATER=>The kid shows Frank stacks of cages with the various types of rabbits in them.
BACK TO FAMILY ROOM=>Frank gazes intently at the screen. The Holy Avenger's words cut deep.
BACK TO SCENE=>Frank stares at the scene, transfixed.
FRANK=>Sarah, come with me.
JACQUES=>That's the last time.
HAMILTON=>Frank. What the fuck?
MOMENTS LATER=>Frank prays on his knees beside his bed.
LATER=>Frank tosses and turns in bed, unable to sleep, his mind on fire with the events of the past few days.
BACK TO SCENE=>Frank's bedroom wall and ceiling crack open further, and more blinding light bursts forth. There are no angels singing, only the RUMBLING and the SCREAMS of the damned.
BACK TO SCENE=>Frank opens his eyes. Everything is back to normal. The air-conditioner, clock, birds, and other dim sounds of the night surround him.
LIBBY=>What? The Avengers?
FRANK=>I've never read it.
ON TV=>SUPER: "SGT. LAWRENCE FITZGIBBON, DPD."
MOMENTS LATER=>Frank waits in the long line. Not so far ahead of him, a RUDE MAN and his GIRLFRIEND butt into line. People GRUMBLE, but don't do anything about it. The GUY behind Frank is peeved.
MOMENTS LATER=>Frank clumsily changes into his costume in the front seat. Accidentally HONKS the horn.
MOMENTS LATER=>The Crimson Bolt, looking determined, walks across the lot, holding his red lead pipe.
LIBBY=>Back there with you.
IN THE KITCHEN=>Libby runs up to Frank, puts the paper down on the counter.
MOMENTS LATER=>Frank stuffs the costume and bolt rod into the trash bag as well.
MOMENTS LATER=>Frank's car stops at an intersection. Frank glances up at the street sign -- BEDLINGTON AVE.
JACQUES=>All right. You ready?
ON THE GROUNDS=>The Crimson Bolt darts around the bushes. Behind him he can see the four men chasing him.
FRANK=>What are you doing?
LIBBY=>This is what you do?
LIBBY=>Fucking cocksucker!
STOREFRONT STREET=>Frank, trying to ignore his sore leg, runs past shops and pedestrians as Quill chases him.
AN ALLEY=>Frank stops for a moment. He looks down at his leg, which is sore and bleeding again. Frank pulls the Crimson Bolt mask onto his face.
LIBBY=>Drives Frank's car after Quill and Toby and toward the alley. But the alley's too narrow for the car. She looks for another way. And drives off in a different direction.
BACK TO ALLEY=>The Crimson Bolt, wearing his mask but in regular clothes, hobble-runs out of the alley and to --
A STREET=>Quill catches up to the Crimson Bolt. He grabs his shirt. The shirt rips as both of them fall to the sidewalk. Quill and Toby jump on the Crimson Bolt, punching him.
MOMENTS LATER=>Libby looks around and closes the garage door behind them.
FRANK=>What are you doing?
FRANK=>What are you doing?
LIBBY=>Here. Put this on.
LIBBY=>Oh... oh yes. Aaah.
LIBBY=>Hold on. Be quiet.
ABE=>They're coming up.
MIKE=>They're coming up.
LIBBY=>Who are those guys?
LIBBY=>This shit is heavy.
NEARBY=>Three THUGS hear the SCREAMS.
LIBBY=>Frank! Are you -- ?
JACQUES=>'Him?!' Who's 'him'?
