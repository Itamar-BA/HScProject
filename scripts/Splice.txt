CLIVE=>Severing support.
BLOOD-CURDLING SCREECH.=>Elsa GASPS. Clive lurches to rescue... But Ginger does nothing. Merely sniffs at the newborn, nudging it with her nose. Fred emits a PURRING GURGLE. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY The team release a collective sigh of relief. INT. CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- DAY Clive relaxes, watches with fascination as... Excited, Ginger lets out a SHORT SQUAWK, then continues her gentle smelling inspection. A probing tongue cleans the area around Fred's eyes. Elsa crouches in for a close-up, catching her breath.
THE BEDROOM=>Where Elsa drunkenly pulls at Clive's bloody shirt buttons.
ELSA=>I don't think so. CLIVE
ELSA=>We're on a mission, remember? It's not a good time. CLIVE
CLIVE=>Shutting down...? ELSA
ELSA=>One in a million.
CLIVE=>There's confusion.
CLIVE=>El, human cloning's illegal.
CLICK.=>He's hit the button. Instantly, the needle is inserted into the egg and the genetic material is injected into the empty nucleus. Conception.
CLIVE=>Yeah, great. You? DEXTER
LATER:=>Clive and Elsa confer in one corner while the Real Estate Agent waits to the side.
CLIVE=>Yeah. It's cool.
ELSA=>You don't sound so enthusiastic. Is it too expensive? CLIVE
ELSA=>It's... Biting!
ELSA=>Alright. Maybe. CLIVE
IN THE CONTAINMENT ROOM:=>The door opens and Clive and Elsa enter. The Hybrid lies utterly still in its glass prison.
CONTAINMENT CHAMBER=>Now seriously afraid, Elsa looks around the room. The limited view afforded by her helmet forces her to clock her entire body. The room appears empty. She slowly turns... RIGHT INTO THE FACE OF THE CREATURE, hanging suspended upside- down from the molding in the ceiling. Elsa SCREAMS and jumps back. The creature drops from its perch, landing awkwardly on the ground. It rights itself on unsteady feet. Elsa reacts, getting her first good look at the thing: The Hybrid has morphed into A SMALL, BALD FEMALE CHILD. A profoundly malformed child. Its eyes are set on the sides of its head. Arms are absent. Legs are triple-jointed ending with prehensile feet. The LONG TAIL with a BARBED TIP is the only feature it has retained from its previous incarnation. The overall package seems incomplete; even the skin has not fully formed, leaving an IRREGULAR LESION vertically bisecting it from head to crotch. The creature hisses and whips its venomous tail.
CLIVE! OBSERVATION ROOM=>Clive turns to the window. From his angle he can only see the abject terror in Elsa's face.
CLIVE=>What's the matter?
CONTAINMENT CHAMBER=>The creature becomes increasingly agitated by Elsa's presence. She shuffles a careful step sideways. And the Hybrid bolts at her. Elsa reflexively covers herself.
OBSERVATION ROOM=>Clive watches, helpless as the Hybrid tears clumsily over Elsa's body, literally bouncing off the window before scurrying into a corner of the room.
CONTAINMENT CHAMBER=>Elsa gathers herself. She has a clear path to the door now. She sees the Hybrid cowering in the corner, senses its fear.
CONTAINMENT CHAMBER=>An extraordinary thing happens: At the sight of Elsa's exposed face, the Hybrid calms. It's as if the creature recognizes something familiar in her.
ELSA=>It's imprinting.
CLIVE=>...Behind her, helmeted and wielding a metal prod like a weapon. He grabs her and forcibly pulls her from the room, quickly shutting and locking the door behind them. The creature stares after them, frightened and confused.
ELSA=>You think you can do that?
ELSA=>See that? It must have developed the Ambysotma growth gene.
CLIVE=>It's aging fast.
LAB STAFF.=>Dexter swabs samples of Ginger's dorsal excretions, while Clive pulls a blood sample. The little creature shakes under the needle.
DEXTER=>Sure... anything.
BARLOW=>She isn't too happy about the new directive, is she? CLIVE
SCREAM.=>Clive jumps up as Elsa spins around in time to see... The Hybrid's back spasms, muscles twist, flesh stretches grotesquely as if something inside were trying to break out. RIIIIP! A slender girlish arm erupts from her side. Bleeding and dripping with shreds of skin, it lashes out and grips Elsa's leg with two bony fingers and an opposing thumb.
ELSA=>
CLIVE=>We have to be careful not to project too much onto her.
CLIVE=>Storage. It's not working. We need to order a new...
MOMENTS LATER=>The sink is almost full. Dren's condition is considerably worse. Her nose is completely clogged, throat swollen, she can hardly breathe. Clive turns off the faucet. ELSA
ELSA=>There's no time.
LATER:=>Dren is out of the sink, looking very much revived as Elsa pats her down with a towel.
CLIVE=>Now we know what those "blobs" are. Amphibious lungs! ELSA
CLIVE=>Yeah. Of course.
ELSA=>While genetically she follows the same template as our H-40 hybrids, the added human element appears to be taking a dominant role.
VIEW. END MONTAGE=>INT. STORAGE ROOM -- NIGHT Clive puts down the camcorder as Elsa dims the light near Dren, who is tucking under the covers, post-bath. Elsa begins to step away, when Dren bolts upright, her arms reaching out, clearly agitated.
CLIVE=>Hey... we don't have any...
JOAN=>Hormonal changes? ELSA
BARLOW=>Just like that? Changed sex? How could this happen? CLIVE
JOAN=>No more monsters!
ELSA=>I'm sorry, honey. I'm not mad at you. I was just worried.
GUARD.=>INT. LAB -- MORNING Clive enters the remodeled lab, walking down a long line of identical, evenly spaced work cubicles. As he passes, the faces of his co-workers stare out mournfully from their boxes. Like prisoners of war, observing their conquered leader in chains. With a sigh, Clive settles into his own cubical. Just another employee. The first thing he sees is Barlow's head, over the partition.
CLIVE=>Not feeling well.
INSIDE DREN'S SPACE=>She curls up, petting the cat with a kind of tender gratitude. Something uglier than her. EXT. FARM -- NIGHT Two vehicles pull up in front of the farmhouse. Clive slides down from the driver's side of the van. Elsa issues from their vintage hotrod. Together they unload boxes of equipment and supplies from the back of the van.
TEDIOUS!=>She spelled TEDIOUS!
ELSA=>Come back here, right now!
ELSA=>Dren. Stop that!
ELSA=>And dangerous. You have to stop contradicting me in front of Dren.
ELSA=>You're a part of me. And I'm a part of you... I'm inside you. I'll always be here for you. Always.
ELSA=>I don't think so.
CLIVE=>Right and wrong. ELSA
CLIVE=>Except. For. Her.
ELSA=>We can't do that.
VEHICLE.=>EXT. BARN -- NIGHT Clive and Elsa come out of the barn as a SEDAN roars up the drive. The door flies open and Dexter steps out. His expression is a combination of stern resolve and guilt.
ELSA=>See for yourself.
SHHHRK!=>A violent backwash of air. Barlow's face is frozen in an odd state of consternation until... ...his head slides off his neck. And drops on the lawn. The rest of his body crumbles after it. Elsa SCREAMS, stumbles backwards. Clive reacts, stunned as... Something lands on the ground between them. Something big.
DREN.=>Covered in grave dirt. Resurrected. Transformed.
MALE.=>The difference in physiology is unmistakable. The eyes are now set in the front of the skull, defining him as a predator. The arms more developed, hips narrowed, pectorals pure rippling muscle. And the wings are massive, one still coated with a streak of Barlow blood. The only detail that clearly marks this as the Dren that we once knew is the blazing shock of white hair on the left side of his head. Male-Dren turns to Elsa, takes a threatening step forward.
ELSA=>Where's the keys? CLIVE
WINDSHIELD:=>Dexter. Savagely mauled and very dead. Elsa cries out. Clive stares, mute. From above, THE SOUND OF POWERFUL FLAPPING WINGS. Elsa swallows her horror, leaps out of the van and grabs Clive.
SILENCE.=>She waits. Finally, rises, cautiously pokes her head above the horizon of amber, her knuckles white around the handle of the butcher knife. BEHIND HER, two enormous multicolored wings silently spread outward as the form of Male-Dren rises into view. Elsa whirls around. The wings envelope her, whipping the knife from her hand, flinging it into the wheat field.
