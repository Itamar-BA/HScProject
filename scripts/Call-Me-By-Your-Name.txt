ELIO=>L'usurpateur.
ANNELLA=>Dove è Elio?
ELIO=>I’m Elio.
ELIO=>We're sharing the bathroom. It's my only way out...
PERLMAN=>The origin of our Italian ‘albicocca’ was ‘al-barquq’...
OLIVER=>I beg to differ. PERLMAN
PERLMAN=>I was testing you.
ELIO=>The same one?
OLIVER=>Forget I asked. ELIO
PERLMAN=>I think your insights here are persuasive, but.. OLIVER
OLIVER=>Yes, kind.
ELIO=>Thinking, then. OLIVER
ELIO=>Later, maybe.
ELIO=>Yeah, come on.
MARZIA=>A cause de lui.
MARZIA=>Retourne-toi. Ne me regarde pas.
OLIVER=>Try again later.
ANNELLA=>Try later, what?
OLIVER=>PERLMAN
ELIO=>I have to go!!
PERLMAN=>Are you going too?
DAY=>MAFALDA appears in the corridor, holding the laundry of the two young men. She brusquely opens Oliver’s door, puts Oliver’s shorts, socks, handkerchiefs, maybe the blue “billowy” shirt, on his dresser. She goes out, then knocks on Elio’s door.
OLIVER=>So does he speak?
ELIO=>No, he fudges.
ELIO=>I know nothing Oliver. Nothing, just nothing.
ELIO=>So much of it is wrong.
ELIO=>That too.
ELIO=>Not yet.
ELIO=>We can stop by the pharmacist on the way back.
OLIVER=>Don’t say that. ELIO
OLIVER=>You just rhymed.
OLIVER=>Are you going to be okay?
CHIARA=>Alors... On sort ou pas?
65A=>ELIO makes himself a smoothie in Mafalda’s kitchen, cutting up a peach, a banana, then a pear, dates. Mafalda wants to do it for him and tries to take the knife away. To her, a smoothie is a foreign concoction.
ELIO=>Est-ce qu’Oliver est là?
ANNELLA=>Lasciamolo fare. MAFALDA enters the kitchen.
ANNELLA=>Il y a un moment.
ELIO=>
ANNELLA=>Our muvi star... OLIVER
ANNELLA=>Ennnnnni taaim... PERLMAN
PERLMAN=>No poker either?
ELIO=>Ca t’a dérangé?
ELIO=>
MARZIA=>Tu lis vraiment autant que ça ? Je veux direi: moi aussi, j'aime lire, mais je ne le dis à personne.
MARZIA=>Parfois. Pas toi?
ELIO=>Way over the top.
OLIVER=>They’re amazing. But these are far more... sensual. PERLMAN
OLIVER=>What's the time?
MARZIA=>Montons dans ta chambre. ELIO
AFTERNOON=>ELIO and MARZIA go up the stairs that take to the upper floor of the building.
ELIO=>I am more so.
OLIVER=>That’s a start.
A LITTLE LATER=>OLIVER pulls out and says to ELIO that he is going to come. ELIO watches the formidably discreet, formidably cool OLIVER make faces and peak before his very eyes. When he comes, it’s all over Elio’s chest, saying “I want to! I want to!”. It is a shock at first when OLIVER spreads his semen out with the palm of his hand over Elio’s stomach and chest. OLIVER, still straddling ELIO, picks up his billowy blue shirt from the floor and cleans him with it.
OLIVER=>I knew we shouldn’t have. I knew it. We should have talked. Maybe.
OLIVER=>Something wrong?
ELIO=>I don’t know.
ELIO=>I’m not telling anyone. There won’t be any trouble. OLIVER
LIFE IN THE GARDEN=>A second unit series of shots of life in the garden. INT. KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - EARLY AFTERNOON MAFALDA is washing dishes in the kitchen. She clears away the dessert plates from lunch with their fruit peelings. ANCHISE enters the room with a basket full of huge, glowing, succulent-looking peaches.
OLIVER=>This song!
ELIO=>There’s no song. You’re hallucinating.
ELIO=>I think he did.
PERLMAN=>Have I spoken out of turn?
OLIVER=>I miss you too. Very much. I have some news.
OLIVER=>Oliver.. I remember everything ...
