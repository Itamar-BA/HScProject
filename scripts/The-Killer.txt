SIDNEY=>Do you follow the eight fold path?
SIDNEY=>I used to come here when, I was very young. My Father brought me. He thought it was a place of perfect tranquility...Do you believe in God?
JEFF=>Everyone believes in God.
SIDNEY=>There are atheists --
JEFF=>They believe in luck. It's the same thing.
SIDNEY=>Want to count it?
JEFF=>I trust you.
SIDNEY=>You know who he is?
SIDNEY=>You have a problem?
SIDNEY=>A very bad man -- Nobody will ever miss him.
JEFF=>As he walks through the temple --
MAN IN THE PHOTO=>Reaches for his gun --
THUG=>JERKING and TWISTING as the slugs TEAR into him --
THUG=>Killed instantly
SIDNEY=>They took her to the Royal Hong Kong. Straight to Emergency. I know a woman who works there. We can find out how she's doing.
JEFF=>You've already talked to her?
JENNY=>I can't see...
DOCTOR V.O.=>...the impact from the bullet exploding out of the gun...
JENNY=>I can't see.
DOCTOR V.O.=>...may have damaged the optic --
JENNY=>Will I be blind?
DOCTOR=>Can you see anything?
JENNY=>Light. Shapes. Everything's blurred. Nothing's clear.
DOCTOR=>It may only be temporary. It depends on the amount of damage to the optic nerve...
JENNY=>Will I be blind?
DOCTOR=>There's no way to tell right now.
CHANG=>I'm Sergeant Chang from the police. Did you see the man who did this to you?
CHANG=>Could you describe him?
FIRES.=>A WASH OF BLOOD seeps across the screen --
CHANG=>I'm sorry...
JENNY=>Please.
JENNY SINGS O.S.=>The same SONG from earlier...
CHANG=>Excuse me, are you F.B.I. Agent Lee?
CHANG=>Welcome to Hong Kong. I hope you will have a productive visit.
LEE=>Thank you. I look forward to getting acquainted.
CHANG=>Your first visit to Hong Kong?
LEE=>Yes. My first time here.
CHANG=>My superiors are looking forward to meeting you.
LEE=>It will be my pleasure, I'm sure.
ROGERS=>I've been asked to give you all the help I can. I'm afraid that will be very little. We have rather a lot of our own problems just at the moment.
LEE=>The man in the picture is wanted on Federal charges in the United States.
OFFICE=>Rogers drops the photo.
ROGERS=>As I told you on the telephone, neither his name nor his picture shows up on our computer.
LEE=>Our sources say that he's living in Hong Kong...
ROGERS=>He's charged with "depriving a citizen of his civil rights"..? You'll pardon me, but this seems a rather trivial offense...
LEE=>He deprived this citizen of his civil rights by putting seven bullets in his head and body.
ROGERS=>I'm told there are hundreds of murders a day in your country. What's so special about this one to take you so far out of your jurisdiction?
ROGERS=>You'll pardon my own lack of enthusiasm.
LEE=>We also believe he is a contract killer with at least twenty-five notches on his gun.
ROGERS=>Not a bad number. You'll find killers for hire are rather common in Hong Kong...Of course we'll help you in any way we can.
LEE=>I'll try not to be a burden.
ROGERS=>Please remember you have neither authority nor jurisdiction here, which means if you do find him, you will inform us and we will decide what action, if
LEE=>Perfectly.
ROGERS=>And I'll have your gun.
LEE=>I don't carry it on social occasions.
ROGERS=>You will not carry a gun on any occasion in the Colony.
LEE=>I wouldn't dream of it.
ROGERS=>As you're here, there is something you could do for us. If you'd like..?
LEE=>I hope ii doesn't involve carrying a gun.
ROGERS=>Ask Sergeant Chang to come in, please.
JENNY=>Do you have a request?
JEFF=>I'm sorry. I only speak English.
JENNY=>Do you wish a request?
JENNY=>It's all right, I can manage by myself.
WAITER=>Do you have a ride home?
JENNY=>There's a cab stand at the end of the street.
WAITER=>Wait a minute. I'll walk with you..
JENNY=>Please. I'll be all right by myself.
TWO RIDERS.=>They trail her for a moment. Speed up -- The passenger GRABS Jenny's bag. Knocks her over. The Driver accelerates... Gets about ten feet. Jeff suddenly appears out of the shadows -- A FLYING KICK sends Driver and Passenger sprawling. The motorcycle CRASHES into a flower stand --
JENNY=>Help! Get away from me.
JEFF=>Wait...
JEFF=>I m trying to help you.
JENNY=>I'm sorry.
JEFF=>Are you all right?
JENNY=>Thank you. Is this my bag?
JENNY=>You got it back?
JEFF=>It's all over now. Can I take you home?
JENNY=>Thank you, but you've done enough for me already --
JEFF=>Then, maybe you can reward me by letting me take you home.
JENNY=>You were in the club. You spoke to me, left me money --
JEFF=>I come a lot to hear you sing --
JENNY=>You're an American?
JEFF=>From New York. It's almost the same thing. My name is Jeff.
JENNY=>You speak no Cantonese?
JEFF=>Twenty or thirty words...
JENNY=>Then you don't understand the songs?
JEFF=>It's probably better that way. Here's the car.
JENNY=>I hate being so helpless...
JENNY=>I hate it. I'll never get used to it.
JEFF=>Would you like me to have a look around? Just to be safe?
JENNY=>Thank you. Coming home alone still scares me.
JEFF=>Don't you have a boyfriend?
JENNY=>I got rid of him. I feel sorry enough for myself. I didn't need any more help.
JEFF=>You sure that's the way he felt?
JENNY=>It's the way I felt... Would you like something to drink? I think I have some brandy.
JEFF=>I don't want to keep you up.
JEFF=>I can get it.
JENNY=>It might be better. At least you'll know what you're getting. I'm still not too good at fumbling in the dark.
JEFF=>You can't see at all?
JENNY=>'Brighter days ahead.
JEFF=>Isn't there anything that can be done? An operation or something?
JENNY=>No. The optic nerve is damaged. They say it might heal by itself, but it might not.
JENNY=>Wouldn't you like to sit down?
JENNY=>You're looking at the scarf, aren't you?
JEFF=>The bloodstains are yours?
JENNY=>The man who did this to me used it to bandage me.
JEFF=>Why do you keep it?
JENNY=>I keep momentos of all the big events in my life.
JEFF=>I was never crazy about brave and cheerful.
JENNY=>I haven't seen my face in six months. I wonder if I've lost my looks.
JEFF=>You don't have to worry.
JENNY=>Are you feeling sorry for me or taking advantage of me?
JEFF=>Both.
JENNY=>I think you should go.
JEFF=>Can I see you again?
JENNY=>No. It's not a good idea.
JEFF=>I'd like to.
JENNY=>I sing every night in a bar. You can see me there.
JEFF=>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
CHANG=>It's perfect. Eddy'll never make you for a cop.
LEE=>You don't think I look like a police officer?
CHANG=>Not like a local cop anyway.
LEE=>Your man Eddy is a pretty bad boy?
CHANG=>Not just bad. Insane. And no problem pulling the trigger.
LEE=>Great. Tell me about him. Make me hate him.
LEE=>And who do I represent?
CHANG=>Unspecified. You're just a businessman. If something~ goes wrong, don't give it a second thought. Shoot first and ask questions later.
LEE=>What's going to go wrong?
CHANG=>Eddy. sorry we're late.
EDDY=>This the customer?
CHANG=>Tony Lee say hello to Eddy.
EDDY=>Lee, huh?
LEE=>What's so funny?
LEE=>More likely my brother. My old man got around pretty good.
EDDY=>Let's see the money.
CHANG=>Now, let's see the guns.
COP=>What's going on here'
CHANG=>Nothing. Just a little reunion.
COP=>What's in the suitcases?
CHANG=>Ladies underwear. The spring line.
COP=>Let's have a look.
CHANG=>Officer, do we really...
COP=>Open 'em up. Now!
CHANG=>What are you talking about?! You know me!
EDDY=>I don't know you from shit!
CHANG=>I'm no cop.
LEE=>Cut this shit out and let's do business.
EDDY=>Sure. Here's how this deal is going to work. I take the money~ keep the guns, and kill you. How does that sound~
BLASTING.=>One Thug takes a bullet sandwich while firing at Lee -- Chang jumps on Eddy.... Thug #3 SHOOTS Chang in the leg, then BLAM! BLAM!
EDDY=>Boarding a CROWDED STREETCAR --
LEE=>Freeze!
LEE=>Help me! Goddammit! Help me!
COMMISSIONER=>He should be deported and shipped out on the next plane.
ROGERS=>He was on special assignment at my request.
COMMISSIONER=>We don't have enough cowboys and kung fu killers of our own? You have to turn some trigger happy American G-man loose on the streets with a gun?
ROGERS=>It was in the line of duty...
LEE=>This guy had just killed a cop, shot two innocent bystanders -- More innocent lives were in danger so I shot him. You think I should have waited for him to shoot me? Maybe a few more civilians?
COMMISSIONER=>The woman died of a heart attack. You might as well have shot her.
ROGERS=>Just a moment. He shot one of the most vicious criminals in the Colony. That the woman died is regrettable...
COMMISSIONER=>Regrettable ..?
ROGERS=>Tragic, if you like, but not due to any irresponsibility or dereliction on his part.
COMMISSIONER=>He should never have been on the street with a gun.
ROGERS=>That was my decision. And I will take full responsibility for it.
COMMISSIONER=>Yes, you will.
CHANG=>I think he ought to get a medal for killing the son of a bitch.
LEE=>You're a stand up guy. Thanks.
LEE=>Come on. You love me.
ROGERS=>I want you to get your business done and get the hell out of Hong Kong before there's any more carnage.
LEE=>Help me find my man and I'm outta here.
ROGERS=>Sergeant Chang you are to assist Mr. Lee in any way you can that does not involve the slaughter of innocent civilians.
JEFF=>How did you know it was me?
JENNY=>I don't know. I just knew. Maybe now that I've lost my sight, my other senses are getting stronger. I've heard that's supposed to happen.
JEFF=>They do that in martial arts training. Blindfold you and make you use your other senses...I saw a lot of Kung Fu movies when I was a kid.
JEFF=>You've already had enough sympathy. I know. You said that too.
JENNY=>Now I'm sorry about the way I talked last night.
JEFF=>Are you going to apologize for feeling sorry for yourself!
JENNY=>I was. Stupid, huh?
JEFF=>Do you want to get back at the one who did it to you?
JENNY=>I'd like to make him blind...
JENNY=>I think he feels guilty. He tried to help me. After it happened...He didn't do it on purpose.
JEFF=>Then, you forgive him?
JENNY=>No. I don't forgive him...I don't really want to talk about this anymore.
JEFF=>I'm the one. I'm the one who did it. I shot you.
JENNY=>Why do you tell me this? Why did you come back?
JEFF=>I came back because I felt guilty. I'm telling you because I want you. I want to be with you.
JENNY=>You could have stayed with me last night.
JEFF=>I couldn't...
JENNY=>Why not? It would have been easy. I would have let you. I was at the end of my resistance. Should I be afraid? Maybe you're going to kill me?. I'm the only witness who saw you.
JEFF=>Call the police. I won't stop you.
JENNY=>Why did you tell me?
JEFF=>I don't feel much. At all. Ever. I'm trained not to. But...I don't know. I had to tell you. I couldn't deceive you. No matter...what.
JENNY=>All day today, I remembered. I was hoping to see you. I thought maybe you'd come to the bar, but then I didn't know. I'm talking to you like I've already slept with you. You know why?
JENNY=>You've already changed my life more than any man I've ever met...
JENNY=>When you make love, do you close your eyes?
JEFF=>Sometimes.
JENNY=>I thought it was you before you told me.
JEFF=>How?
JENNY=>Wouldn't you know me in the dark? My smell. My presence...?
JEFF=>Is that really true?
JENNY=>It's true. .
JEFF=>And you went with me anyway?
JENNY=>That's all you need to know about me.
JEFF=>You need to know more about me. I'm a killer. I don't know how to explain it. I'm good at it. I get paid well. I decide who I'm going to kill. It's w%at I do. It's all I've ever done. Kill people. But I still think of myself as a good man. And I want to be with you. Now. Tomorrow. Next week. Next month. Next year.
JENNY=>You're in love with me. Yes? But you have to be in love with me to justify hurting someone innocent --
JEFF=>You think that's true?
JENNY=>Yes. But its' good. I'll have you forever. You have to live a long time. For me. You owe it to me.
JEFF=>The briefcase. I guess somebody's got a big problem.
JEFF=>'Want a beer?
SIDNEY=>Sure.
JEFF=>How's the action hand?
SIDNEY=>Pretty useless.
JEFF=>If you don't use it, you lose it.
JEFF=>Is it the hand or the nerve?
SIDNEY=>Just the hand.
JEFF=>Let's see what you' got?
SIDNEY=>Are you sure?
JEFF=>C'mon...
JEFF=>Tony Weng...
JEFF=>I thought he was your boss.
SIDNEY=>So did he. That's why my boss wants him dead.
JEFF=>So who's your boss?
SIDNEY=>It's better you don't know.
SIDNEY=>You want it or not?
JEFF=>I'll do it. I should do it for free. As a service to humanity. This guy's a scumbag.
SIDNEY=>It won't be easy. He's got heavy protection around all the time.
JEFF=>This is my last job. I'll do it right.
SIDNEY=>Ir must be a woman.
JEFF=>Yeah.
SIDNEY=>The singer?
SIDNEY=>Does she know about you?
SIDNEY=>That's dangerous.
JEFF=>Yeah...It's great.
JEFF=>Easy to pick up. Hard to put down.
JENNY=>I think you must be very handsome.
JEFF=>I have to go away for a few days.
JENNY=>Don't tell me about it. I don't want to know. I'm happy now. That's enough.
JEFF=>I have a job. I can't say no to it.
JEFF=>I have to do it. It's the last of that life...
JENNY=>You don't have to do anything. Except be good to rne.
JENNY=>I've got a passport -- There's nothing here I can't leave in a minute.
JEFF=>You're sure you don't hate me?
JENNY=>Not now, anyway. I'm too much in love now. Maybe later.
LEE=>This looks like my man. 'Killed a local Mr. Big and six heavies. Walks in a nightclub by himself. A gun in each pocket. Blows away the target and whoever else gets in his way and walks out.
CHANG=>I was on that case.
LEE=>You got a whole bunch of eyewitnesses here...Male, Caucasian, medium height, medium build... That's the best they could do?
CHANG=>I questioned most of them myself. Mainly gang types. Nobody saw anything.
LEE=>What about this girl he blinded?
CHANG=>I questioned her. She was in shock. Couldn't remember what happened.
LEE=>Anybody talk to her lately?
LEE=>She can talk. Let's get her in. Put her with an artist and let her draw us a picture.
LEE=>What else you got to do? I'm telling you this is my man.
CHANG=>I have lots to do. Especially today. Unlike you. I'm not on holiday.
LEE=>I thought you were on holiday. Isn't today a holiday?
CHANG=>Well, today... Today is a holiday, but...
LEE=>What holiday is it?
AT THE DOCK=>Chang & Lee sit in a POLICE LAUNCH watching.
P.A. VOICE=>Attention all competitors. Please report to the floating platform for the opening ceremony.
CHANG=>This years honorary chairman is a respected local businessman who is also the Colony s biggest drug trafficker.
LEE=>I see you're people are taking good care of him.
CHANG=>Police protection for this scum! His private army's bigger than the police force!
LEE=>What's happens now?
CHANG=>He dots the eye of the dragon and the race starts.

DRUMMER=>Pounding for all he's worth --
LEE=>There!
CHANG=>Where?
LEE=>It's him.
PLATFORM=>A COP talking into a walkie talkie.
COP=>It came from the direction of the fishing boats. Seal off the harbor.
CHANG=>I haven't got a radio.
LEE=>What about the boat?
CHANG=>How the hell do I know? It's not my boat.
LEE=>He's got to be around --
JEFF=>Waves back...
FIRING.=>BULLETS PUNCHING the sand all around him --
FIRING.=>Drums of GASOLINE nearby --
JEFF=>Speed reloads --
GUNMAN=>Bullets rip into him --
LEE=>There!
CHANG=>We'll never catch him in this thing!
LEE=>Is there a hospital around here -- anywhere?
CHANG=>Sacred Heart!
LEE=>He'll take the girl there!
DOCTOR=>WHAT happened to her?
JEFF=>She was shot.
DOCTOR=>Oxygen. Check her blood pressure. prepare her for surgery.
JEFF=>She's going to be all right --
NURSE=>We'll take good care of her,
NURSE=>Blood pressure's low.
JEFF=>Is she all right?
NUN=>She's lost a lot of blood.
NURSE=>Pulse is dropping.
CHANG=>A man came through carrying a child..?
NURSE=>They went to emergency.
CHANG=>Call headquarters for backup! Don't let anyone leave!
NUN=>Are you related to the patient?
NUN=>How did it happen?
NUN=>Wait a minute! You can't go! I have to register your name!
CORRIDOR=>The Nun comes out into the corridor.
NUN=>Sir...Wait...
LEE=>Where is he?
NUN=>Who are you?
LEE=>I'm with the police.
NUN=>Let me see your badge.
CHANG=>Police! He's with me!
CHANG=>Where is he?
JEFF=>Put the gun on the floor.
JEFF=>Okay. Fine. Say goodbye to your friend.
JEFF=>Kick it away.
LEE=>You are wanted...
JEFF=>Don't talk! Do it!
JEFF=>Get down on the floor.
THE LITTLE GIRL=>Shows some sign of life.
NURSE=>Her pulse is rising, She'.s breathing on her own.
CHANG=>What happened~
COP=>There was a gunshot.
LEE=>Where?
COP=>From over there.
ROGERS=>Your man, as you call him, is now wanted for murder by us which means that your official duties here are finished. We may want you back as a witness in a trial...
LEE=>First you've got to arrest him.
ROGERS=>We'll see to that.
LEE=>I will remind you that he is wanted on a prior charge in the U.S., and we will apply for extradition if you catch him.
ROGERS=>Extradition is the province of our respective governments. Not for us.
LEE=>The suspect may be an American citizen.
ROGERS=>Don't you want to go home?
LEE=>Not until my job's done.
LEE=>I'd just like to help out -- see this thing through to the finish...
ROGERS=>There are likely to be some politically sensitive aspects to this case of which you are unlikely to be aware.
LEE=>I'll work under the investigating officer and merely offer my assistance.
ROGERS=>Chang will be in charge. I will leave this up to him.
CHANG=>I need all the help I can get.
ROGERS=>You understand you will have no official status. You will be an adviser.
LEE=>I understand that.
ROGERS=>I'll want daily reports.
CHANG=>Yes, sir.
LEE=>I guess I get to keep my gun.
CHANG=>I noticed.
LEE=>Number two what?
CHANG=>In the Five Flowers Tong. Crime syndicate. Prostitution, gambling, drugs, guns
LEE=>So our man's an outside hired gun. Who's the new number one?
CHANG=>Don't know. We'll have to wait and see. Probably a power struggle. Maybe our man will tell us.
LEE=>Let's assume he did them both. I say we start with the singer. Jenny Kwan. He risked his life for the
CHANG=>He may be soft on blind girls and kids, but he's got to be smart enough to get out of town. There were people trying to kill him out there today. I doubt they're just going to give up.
LEE=>Maybe. Or maybe he's going to stick around. Solve his own problem -- I got a feeling for this guy. I think he s pissed off that he was crossed on the beach. And I don't think he just stiffs the blind girl...
CHANG=>Quite a guy. You sure you want to catch him?
LEE=>Oh, yeah. He has to go. The man's a killer.
JEFF=>I want my money.
SIDNEY=>You should have left town.
JEFF=>I want it tonight.
SIDNEY=>You'll have it.
PAYNE=>I've never thought of you as a cricket man, Sidney.
SIDNEY=>You didn't tell me you wanted Jeff dead.
PAYNE=>Will you have tea, Sidney?
SIDNEY=>Thank you.
PAYNE=>I'll be Mum.
SIDNEY=>Yes. But I would have counseled you against it. I still counsel you against it.
SIDNEY=>I only want what is best for this house and for you.
PAYNE=>I want Jeff dead. This house wants Jeff dead. Is that enough for you? Or do you want me to explain --
SIDNEY=>I only ask that you allow me to plead for him first.
PAYNE=>Then you do want an explanation. We police have seen him. They will now begin to look for him. If they catch him he could expose me.
SIDNEY=>He doesn't know it's you. If you pay him...
PAYNE=>He is connected to you. You are connected to me. Kill him, or kill yourself.
SIDNEY=>I am the gun in your hand. You aim. I fire.
PAYNE=>Prove it.
LEE=>Pretty song...
JENNY=>Sorry, I thought you were a friend. I don't see very well.
LEE=>You sing beautifully.
JENNY=>Thank you.
LEE=>Is your friend an American?
JENNY=>Yes. ha
LEE=>Is he coming in? I'd like to meet a countryman.
JENNY=>I don't know. Would you excuse me, please?
LEE=>Sure.
LEE=>She's seeing him. I know it.
CHANG=>How can you be sure?
LEE=>I'm telling you, Elvis is dead and Jenny Kwan is seeing Jeff -- Can we get a twenty four hour a day surveillance and a wire tap?
LEE=>No. No evidence. Just instinct.
CHANG=>I'll try to get it anyway.
SIDNEY=>You don't trust me?
JEFF=>Sure, I trust you, Sidney. You're my friend. My teacher. You taught me the rules.
JEFF=>Still playing by the rules, Sidney?
SIDNEY=>Always.
SIDNEY=>I f I knew I wouldn't tell you. The rules.
JEFF=>You sold me out. What do the rules say about that?
SIDNEY=>If you believe it, you have to kill me.
JEFF=>How did they know I'd be there?
SIDNEY=>I put your car there. They could have followed me. It wouldn't have been hard. I wasn't looking for anybody.
JEFF=>Just careless?
SIDNEY=>I didn't have any reason to be careful. I didn't know they wanted you dead.
JEFF=>Why do they want me dead?
SIDNEY=>They don't want any link between them and the hits.
JEFF=>I don't even know who they are. The only link between them and the jobs I did is you. Why don't they kill you?
SIDNEY=>I'm them now. I work for them. They have my loyalty.
JEFF=>So where does that leave me? ha
SIDNEY=>H ii ya.
JEFF=>That the money?
SIDNEY=>Count it.
INSERT BRIEFCASE=>Empty.
JEFF=>You bring these guys with you?
SIDNEY=>What guys?
JEFF=>Why?
JEFF=>Forget the rules. These people trust you less than I do. Who are they?
SIDNEY=>The Tai Pan of the Five Flowers.
JEFF=>He hired me to kill Weng and Lim? They were his guys --
SIDNEY=>They had other ideas. They were not loyal.
JEFF=>Who's the Tai Pan?
JEFF=>It doesn't make any difference if you tell me, because you're already dead.
SIDNEY=>We're both dead.
JEFF=>Tell me who it is?
SIDNEY=>Simon Payne.
JEFF=>The head of the Five Flowers is English?
JEFF=>Get out.
SIDNEY=>You're not going to kill me?
JEFF=>No.
SIDNEY=>Why?
JEFF=>You did what I would have done. You owe them.
SIDNEY=>I owe you. I'll get you your money.
JEFF=>I'm giving you your life in payment for what I owe you. We re even now. I never want to see you again.
CHANG=>As far as forensics concerned nobody's ever lived in this apartment except these guys.
LEE=>It's him.
CHANG=>Your instinct?
LEE=>That's right.
CHANG=>No prints. No clothes. No personal effects.
LEE=>You show his picture to the neighbors?
CHANG=>Nobody's ever seen him.
LEE=>How is that possible?
CHANG=>Private elevator from the garage. Even the maid's never seen him. The place is rented to an off shore company.
CHANG=>Yes. Of course. We are very meticulous.
CHANG=>It's possible.
LEE=>It's him.
JENNY=>Hello?
JEFF=>It's me.
JENNY=>I was just thinking about you.
JEFF=>Anything good?
JENNY=>It was so good. Want me to tell you about it?
JEFF=>Not now.
JENNY=>Can't you talk?
JEFF=>Not really.
JENNY=>ls something wrong?
JEFF=>Nothing a new life won't solve. Are you ready to travel?
JENNY=>Any time you say.
JENNY=>Any time. I'll be ready.
JEFF=>It'll be soon.
COP=>Call Sergeant Chang. Right away..
WOMAN=>Are you supposed to be the new janitor?
JENNY=>There are cops everywhere. They're using me as bait. Stay away from me!
LEE=>Drop it.
JEFF=>It's not your fault. You don't look like a Hong Kong cop.
LEE=>You don't look much like a Tong hatchet man.
JENNY=>Why don't you go?
JEFF=>He's got a gun on me. I've got one on him.
LEE=>I got plenty of time. I'm not going anywhere.
JEFF=>Who are you?
LEE=>Ronald Lee. FBI.
JEFF=>Little off your turf...
LEE=>Not really. I'm assigned to you. Wherever you are is my turf.
JEFF=>My own personal FBI agent. What'd I do to get this?
LEE=>Astamendi is the one we've got you for. There are others.
JEFF=>Jenny, why don't you make us some tea. Mr. Lee and I could be here awhile...How do you figure me for that job?
LEE=>You were turned.
LEE=>Yeah. And we don't get paid much either. What have you got on the creep? Maybe we can deal.
JEFF=>You're willing to die to bust me on suspicion of killing some creep?
JEFF=>It's your job, right?
LEE=>It's my job.
JENNY=>Did you hit him?
LEE=>He's here. You take downstairs. I'll take the roof.
LEE=>Freeze!
CHANG=>Don't shoot. It's me. He's right behind me with his gun pointed up my ass.
LEE=>You know he's the one who shot you. Made you blind..
JENNY=>You think that changes how I feel about him?
LEE=>He's a professional killer.
JENNY=>So are you.
LEE=>II' I kill somebody it's because I have to and in defense of the law.
LEE=>It happens.
JENNY=>He's like you. He kills bad people too.
LEE=>Well, there are a lot of very bad people looking to kill him right now. I figure I may be his only ticket out of here alive. But I need help.
JENNY=>I won't help you put him in prison. I'm sure he'd rather be dead...If I could get my sight back but it would mean losing him -- I'd rather be blind...
LEE=>And you think he feels that way about you?
JENNY=>I hope he doesn't. Then he could be far away from here.
SIDNEY=>I f ailed to kill Jeff.
PAYNE=>I noticed.
SIDNEY=>So did your men.
PAYNE=>What's your point?
SIDNEY=>You should keep your word and pay Jeff.
SIDNEY=>Let me keep my word.
PAYNE=>! don't understand why you are still alive, Sidney. The others who tried to kill Jeff are all dead.
SIDNEY=>He spared me because we are friends.
PAYNE=>Even though you betrayed him and tried to kill him?
SIDNEY=>Yes.
PAYNE=>He is a very good friend indeed. We should all have friends like this.
SIDNEY=>He can be a dangerous enemy.
PAYNE=>Arc you suggesting he might be dangerous to me?
PAYNE=>You know there's somebody from the American FBI here looking for him?
SIDNEY=>Yes.
PAYNE=>What if. they catch him?
SIDNEY=>Jeff knows the rules. He'll never talk.
PAYNE=>It's a chance I'm unwilling to take.
PAYNE=>Where the hell is the car? I've decided to use his money as payment to the person who brings me his head.
SIDNEY=>I ask you not to do that.
PAYNE=>It's already done.
SIDNEY=>If it pleases you, I will beg.
PAYNE=>You've served this family well for two generations. I promised my father you would always be taken care of. But you are beginning to become a problem. Don't push your luck.
JEFF=>You know what to say?
PAYNE=>Di op the guns! Drop them!
JEFF=>Sidney. You drive.
SIDNEY=>I'm on the same side as the gun.
JEFF=>If you want to kill me you have to send somebody better than me. And there's nobody better than me. That's why you hired me in the first place. So do I kill you or do you pay me?
PAYNE=>I'll pay you, of course. I don't know how long you II live after that.
JEFF=>It's not smart to threaten a man with a gun.
PAYNE=>I-low do you want the money?
JEFF=>Just like the agreement. Give it to Sidney.
PAYNE=>I won't be able to get cash till the bank opens tomorrow.
JEFF=>I'll just keep you with me until then.
JEFF=>Your word stinks and you have no honor. That's why we're all here in this car --
PAYNE=>You were seen at the Weng hit. The police are looking for you.
PAYNE=>It becomes mine if they catch you.
JEFF=>Don't worry. I know the rules even if you don't.
PAYNE=>I know the rules. I'm good for the money. I'll pay you..
JEFF=>Maybe you're right. I don't think I could stand being with you for the next eight hours. Sometime after midnight, I'd get bored looking at your pretty face. I'~l have to do something about it. l ct me out here.
JEFF=>I'll be in touch. Don't fuck with me about the money. Twenty four hours. Or your dead.
PAYNE=>Il' I asked you to shoot him, would you do it?
SIDNEY=>Yes. After you've paid him.
LEE=>I could have shot him, but I felt it would endanger the civilian.
ROGERS=>The Commissioner will find this a welcome change From your previous policy. This civilian is the girl he blinded in the Lim hit --
ROGERS=>And now she's his girlfriend. It's a novel approach
CHANG=>Twenty four hours a day. Phone tapped and we've lifted her passport.
ROGERS=>My guess is your man is long gone by now.
LEE=>l le's not going to leave without the girl. He said so.
ROGERS=>And you're prepared to rely on his word?
LEE=>Absolutely.
ROGERS=>You'll l pardon my cynicism.
CHANG=>\Ve really don't have anything else to go on --
LEE=>He'll show up for the girl.
ROGERS=>As we have nothing to do, but wait, I suppose we'll wait..
CHANG=>We can't wait too long. Rumor on the street says there's a big price on our man's head.
LEE=>The guys who ordered the hits are offering the reward
CHANG=>That way they can deny responsibility for the deaths of their brothers.
LEE=>Nice way to do business.
ROGERS=>Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Lee.
JEFF=>I can't fail her. I've brought her too much that's bad already.
JEFF=>Maybe it's because I'm guilty. And she forgives me. She doesn't want anything.
SIDNEY=>I'll try to make a deal with Payne, but you may have give up the money.
JEFF=>I'd rather die than let Payne not pay me...Why can't I give up everything for her. Including my pride?
JEFF=>I should have killed you Sidney. But you're the only friend I have. And I need your help;
CHANG=>He just pulled up in his car -- yes we see her -- right...
LEE=>Who's that?
CHANG=>I don't know.
CHANG=>Maybe she's going to the airport.
CHANG=>We better put the airport guys on alert, anyway.
CHANG=>She's not going to the airport. That's where you turn... Maybe we should pull them over.
LEE=>Maybe she's going to meet our man -- They're not trying to lose us.
CHANG V.O.=>Shit. We've got a problem.
LEE V.O.=>What is this place?
CHANG V.O.=>The Walled City. This is where she's going. Shit.
LEE=>What's the matter?
CHANG=>This place belongs to China, not Hong Kong. We have no jurisdiction in there.
LEE=>What do you mean 'we'?
CHANG=>No way -- You don't want to go in there -- It's free zone for every thief, killer, drug addict in the Colony. And there's no law.
CHANG=>That's it.. We don't go any further.
CHANG=>She's lost. If you don't know your way around in there, you'll never get out. It's a rabbit warren in there. With very ugly rabbits.
LEE=>I'll take my chances.
CHANG=>Listen to me. If we go down in there we won't live half an hour. I'm not kidding. It's open season on cops in there.
CHANG=>There''s no place they can go. All we have to do is wait them out. We have informers inside. They'll find them.
LEE=>When they do I'm going in. With or without you. I
JENNY=>Jeff...
SIDNEY=>You're not really safe here. One hour. Two at the most...I'll meet you as soon as I've got the money. Everything else is arranged.
LEE=>No word on where they are?
CHANG=>Not yet. Our informants are working on it.
ROGERS=>I don't really know why we're bothering -- if there really is a price on him he won't last the night in there.. We can't get to him in there but the Five Flowers can.
AUDIENCE=>Payne sits in front. One of his retainers approaches him -- Whispers something . Payne leaves his guests Moves through the audience to the back. The audience eats Talks among themselves . Normal behavior in Chinese Opera.
JEFF=>We have another hour -- then we have to go.
JENNY=>Where?
JEFF=>If everything goes right... Thailand.
JENNY=>I like Thailand. Temples. Elephants.
JEFF=>I hope you like boats.
JENNY=>I love boats.
JEFF=>We'll be on one for a few days.
JENNY=>The police have my passport.
JENNY=>What was that?
LEE=>Hold it!
LEE=>Put your clothes on and let's go.
JEFF=>You don't have any authority here, cop-
LEE=>I got all the authority I need, right here in my hand.
JEFF=>You figure you're going to march me through the streets in handcuffs?
LEE=>Something like that.
JEFF=>You think you can find your way out of here?
JENNY=>Where is he?
JEFF=>A little to the left.
LEE=>C'mon Jenny, put the gun down! I don't want to shoot you but Goddamn it, I will!
JENNY=>Not unless he leaves us alone.
JEFF=>What about it?
JENNY=>Get out. Or, I'll shoot.
JENNY=>I didn't mean to...It went off accidentally.
CHANG=>We have to move! Now!
JEFF=>What's your hurry?
LEE=>We wouldn't want that. Spoil all the preparations we're making for you back home.
CHANG=>About two more blocks
JEFF=>Mind if we stop for a cigarette?
CHANG=>'Not so funny. This is a very bad place...through here
JEFF=>He's dead.
JEFF=>He wanted to kill me.
LEE=>'Too bad he didn't. This was a good man.
LEE=>What do you have in mind?
JEFF=>Man kills your partner, you're supposed to do something about it.
JEFF=>You wounded him. He won't make it very far. Let's you and me have a truce and go kill the son of a bitch.
LEE=>You're still under arrest.
JEFF=>We get out of here alive, we'll talk about it.
JENNY=>Jeff!
JEFF=>You stay here -- you'll be okay. Five minutes. No more. I promise.
ANOTHER ALLEY=>Jeff tracking...
LEE=>He's leaking pretty good...over here --
JEFF=>Yeah
JEFF=>Here...across there --
LEE=>Over here
BAM! BAM! BAM!=>Prostitutes and their TRICKS suddenly come running out, screaming at the two armed men -- All of them half-dressed, shouting, swearing --
LEE=>Jesus Christ...
JEFF=>Shut up!
JEFF=>Bullshit. You're my prisoner. You're out of bullets. I've got two left.
LEE=>Nice try, but you're the one that's bull shittin',
JEFF=>Try your luck. I'll give you a free one.
JEFF=>Like I said, I've got two left.
LEE=>Just because I'm out of gas doesn't mean you're not...
BAM!=>Jeff whistles a bullet by his ear.
JEFF=>I got one left. And you're my prisoner. Or you're dead. Which is it?
LEE=>Shouldn't be too hard for you. You're a killer.
JEFF=>Don't worry. It won't be hard at all.
LEE=>Am I supposed to say thank you?
JEFF=>Never one around when you need one.
JEFF=>You drive.
JENNY=>This is blood, isn't it? Are you hurt?
LEE=>What's the matter?
JEFF=>I took one in the shoulder.
JEFF=>I'll be all right. I just need to get it out.
LEE=>We better get you to a hospital.
JEFF=>You just drive. I'll tell you where to go.
JENNY=>You're losing blood. We have to do something, Bandage you or something. I don't know anything about this and I can't see --
LEE=>Top of my class. And she's right we'd better do something about your shoulder --
JEFF=>Just keep going...
JENNY=>Tell me everything you're doing.
JEFF=>Easy for you to say.
JENNY=>Keep telling me.
LEE=>Now I'm going to sear the wound.
JEFF=>I'm lighting a cigarette.
LEE=>Aren't you afraid you'll get cancer?
JEFF=>I should live so long.
LEE=>Better get you something to bite on so you don't break your teeth.
JEFF=>He means it's going to hurt.
LEE=>Like living hell.
JENNY=>Tell me what you're doing?
LEE=>1"m stanching the wound with gunpowder. Stop the bleeding.
LEE=>You all right?
JENNY=>You're some cop
LEE=>I'm just trying to keep him alive so he can be brought to justice back home...
LEE=>f m just doing my job, what's your excuse?
JENNY=>I'm in love.
LEE=>I don't get it -- this guy blinds you in the middle of committing a crime -- then you just take him into your bed. Fall in love with him. Life goes on, forgive and forget, huh?
JENNY=>I can't really explain it to myself. How could I explain it to you.
LEE=>When did you know he was the one who blinded you?
JENNY=>Before or after l went to bed with him. That's what you want to know?
LEE=>You don't have to answer. I'm just curious.
JENNY=>Why shouldn't I tell you. After.
JENNY=>I know what you're thinking. And you're right.
JEFF=>You both seem to be having a pretty good time...
JEFF=>Hurts like hell, but it's better. Thanks -Which then brings us to the big question of what to do with you..Jenny and I have appointments to keep...
LEE=>Technically you're my prisoner so I figure to go with you...
JEFF=>Sorry, we're traveling alone.
LEE=>You might need some help before you're out of this.
JEFF=>Are you offering?
LEE=>I am.
JEFF=>I accept.
JENNY=>What about arresting him? You just said he was a prisoner.
LEE=>Well work that part out later.
LEE V.O.=>I guess we're here --
JENNY V.O.=>Where are we?
JEFF V.O.=>Po Lin Monastery.
LEE=>How safe are we here?
JEFF=>Depends.
LEE=>Swell. I hope there are a lot of guns in that bag.
JEFF=>No problem.
PAYNE=>I don't want to fuck around anymore Sidney. Either you tell me where Jeff is and keep your position in this house, or you eat shit and die. What's it going to be?
SIDNEY=>Will you break your word?
PAYNE=>Take his gun.
PAYNE=>Don't fuck with me!
PAYNE=>Prop him up.
PAYNE=>Who the hell do you think I am that you can tell me what to do? Did T suddenly get to be so weak? Have I lost so much respect that you dare question my orders? You are a fucking flea, Sidney.
SIDNEY=>We owe him the money. You gave your word.
PAYNE=>My father lifted you out of the stinking pile of shit you came from. And I took the gun out of your hand, put a tie around your neck. 'Gave you position, authority and my trust. You repay me with insolence.
SIDNEY=>You're the tai pan. You must keep your word.
PAYNE=>And that's for you to decide? Do you think I'm weak, Sidney? That I'm not the man my father was?
SIDNEY=>Your father always kept his word.
JEFF=>You get some sleep. I'll come get you when it's time.
JENNY=>You're just getting me out of the way in case something happens.
JEFF=>Nothing's going to happen. You'll need your sleep. It's a long trip.
JEFF=>I have to wait for Sidney. You'll be safe here.
JENNY=>If all I wanted was to be safe, I wouldn't be with YOU.
JEFF=>From now on maybe you'll have both.
JENNY=>I hope so.
JEFF=>I'll be back when it's time. He goes.
PAYNE=>Do you want to tell me now, or do I keep cutting?
SIDNEY=>Tell them.
PAYNE=>Don't shoot!
SIDNEY=>Where's the fucking money?
PAYNE=>Right there. In the briefcase.
PAYNE=>I don't think you've got any bullets left.
SIDNEY=>I don't know. It's not my gun.
SIDNEY=>Take a chance. Let's find out.
LEE=>You think your friend'll show up with the money?
JEFF=>Yeah
LEE=>This is the same friend who sold you out before?
JEFF=>That's's why I'm sure hell show up.
LEE=>The same friend who sold you out to the same people.
JEFF=>I trust him.
I LEE=>I never trusted anybody that much.
I LEE=>So you know Ill come after you?
JEFF=>You're a lawman, aren't you?
LEE=>You should have shot me when you had the chance.
I JEFF=>How could I shoot anybody with a heart as good as
LEE=>Why didn't you?
I JEFF=>I told you. Your heart's good.
LEE=>What about the thug? He's just a guy with a shitty job. Maybe he had a good heart.
JEFF=>No heart. Just a lot of demons.
LEE=>How do you know?
JEFF=>Training. Instinct. How do you know anything?
LEE=>And you figure it's all right for you to just kind of weed those bad hearted guys out --
LEE=>You ever kill anyone with a good heart?
JEFF=>Not lately anyway. Before I met Sidney...
LEE=>I get it. Sidney changed you. From an animal to a killer with nice table manners.
LEE=>You're not going to lay all that 'honor among thieves' bullshit on me, are you?
JEFF=>Were is honor among people. Some people. Thieves, killers, even Iawmen. It's why I trust you.
LEE=>I don't trust anyone.
JEFF=>Bull shit.
LEE=>You think you know me pretty well?
JEFF=>Pretty well Your heart sticks out a mile.
LEE=>I figure saving my life buys you six months. Then I'm on your case again.
JEFF=>'They'll never let you back on my case after tonight.
LEE=>Six months far free. For saving my life and because I'd like to see this poor misguided girl get what she thinks she wants --
LEE=>I wish you could too, but you've got too many debts to pay.
LEE=>Come on, I thought you're a tough guy.
JEFF=>I used to be. But maybe I lost my nerve because of a woman.
LEE=>You won't be the first one.
SIDNEY=>You tell these assholes to do what I say or I'll shoot you right here.
PAYNE=>Do what he says.
SIDNEY=>Get in the elevator! Do it now!
SIDNEY=>I can shoot you in the foot if I have to prove I'm serious.
PAYNE=>Do what he says! Get in the fucking elevator.
SIDNEY=>Push a button.
PAYNE=>You're a dead man, Sidney,
THUGS=>Boss, are you all right? You've been shot? etc.
PAYNE=>Never mind me. Get after him. Kill that son of a bitch.
LEE=>What happens to Jenny if you don't make it?
JEFF=>She'll be taken care of. I've arranged all that.
LEE=>Swiss lawyers, offshore banks... Numbered accounts.
JEFF=>Something like that.
JEFF=>I always get paid. And Sidney needs to restore his honor by paying me.

PAYNE=>Find another entrance!
LEE=>Other entrances?

LEE=>If we're alive when they get here, you're under arrest.
JEFF=>Bullshit. You're my hostage.

PAYNE=>Drop your guns. We all know how this is played.
PAYNE=>Drop your gun and don't take another step.

PAYNE=>I can handle the cops.
JEFF=>Not if you shoot her.

LEE=>No. You're a pro. You don't work for free.
JEFF=>We got to go.
LEE=>Six months and then you start looking over your shoulder.
LEE=>You take care of her --
LEE=>Bye, Jenny.
JEFF=>Your story might look better to the police if you were UNCONSCIOUS.
LEE=>Oh shit...
