MODERN TRADER=>But there were some who saw it coming... While the whole world was having a big ol’ party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could. Not me, I’m not a weirdo. I’m pretty cool. We’ll meet later. These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy. And they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do: they looked.
YOUNG ANALYST=>No. I didn’t know that.
MICHAEL BURRY=>Did you find it strange-
MICHAEL BURRY=>90 days late... 30 days late... These bonds are one of the banks’ biggest revenue sources... They need more mortgages to fill them... That’s why it’s all adjustable rate high risk... They’re giving mortgages to people who can’t afford mortgages in order to fill these bonds, in order to earn fees...
LAWRENCE FIELDS=>Great Michael. Whenever you find something interesting we all tend to make money. What stock are you valuing?
MICHAEL BURRY=>Once the majority of adjustable rates kick in 07’ they will begin to fail and when they fail above 15% the whole bond is worthless.
CYNTHIA=>You hate your job.
MARK=>I love my job!
CYNTHIA=>You're miserable!
JARED VENNETT=>Porter Collins: former Olympic rower who went to Brown. He had worked with Baum at a previous firm and couldn’t figure out why no one listened to Baum, the guy with all the good ideas.
DANNY=>Yeah, okay. Fine.
YOUNG BANKER=>Ted asked me to do some meeting prep but I couldn't find any marketing material on you.
CHARLIE=>God he’s paranoid.
SEMINAR LEADER=>Real estate is the only entrepreneurial activity available to all Americans. Why? Simple, it doesn't require capital. That's right. Let me say that again. You don't need money to be a real estate millionaire!
TATTOOED NECK=>Cause my kid just got settled in the school.
MIKE'S ASSISTANT=>) Scion. Dr. Burry's office. ...He would prefer you email him...I sit twenty feet away and I email him--
LAWRENCE FIELDS=>There will be redemptions.
REAL ESTATE AGENT=>House on the left might be motivated...That is another quasi- motivated seller...They're probably teensy-weensy bit motivated...In her case I'd say possibly almost motivated.
YOUNGER AGENT=>This market won't last.
PORTER=>They're bragging.
DANCER=>Only in the VIP.
BEN=>Oh this won’t be fun.
MARK=>Somebody call Vennett.
MARK=>Motherfuckers!
VINNY=>That’s not all Mark...
MARK=>You want a job?
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL=>So despite these temporary aberrant numbers we’re quite pleased.
PORTER=>Fucking stop it.
CHARLIE=>Loaded with assets?
SELENA GOMEZ=>People are cray cray.
PORTER=>What else is new?
JAMIE=>Stop saying Wow.
LUCY THALIA=>They’re independent markets. They’re not always correlated. I know it sounds odd but these are very complicated products.
MIKE=>I'm listening.
MARK=>Congratulations.
JAMIE=>You can do this Ben ...
BEN=>That’s what I thought...
CHARLIE=>I’m done. No more.
CHARLIE=>You damn straight.
BRUCE MILLER=>How do you really feel?
YOUNG BANKER=>From the time you guys started talking, Bear Stearns stock has fallen more than 38 percent. Would you buy more now?
VINNY=>Mark, finally!
MICHAEL BURRY=>I met my wife on Match.com. My profile said, quote, I am a medical student with only one eye, an awkward social manner, and $145,000 in student loans, end quote.
JARED=>And when all was said and done, only one single banker went to jail.
