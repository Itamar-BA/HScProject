ROAD TO HELL=>INT. AUDI DRIVING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. We are driving at high speed in the fast lane of an empty country road as the third track from the Flashdance album plays on the stereo. We see a sign that reads: “BUENOS AIRES: 270 MILES.” DIEGO—a tall blond man of about forty—is calmly driving his Audi A5. An old Peugeot 504 sputtering smoke from its muffler is going about 50 mph in the fast lane. Diego flashes his lights but the driver of the Peugeot doesn’t budge.

Through the large window that opens onto the backyard, he sees the lawyer and the detective talking near the pool. The detective has a serious look on his face. He thinks, shakes his head, says something and then shakes his head again. Every so often he looks towards the upper levels of the house, where Helena and Santiago’s bedrooms are. After exchanging some final words with the detective, the lawyer asks him to wait. He walks back inside the house to talk to Mauricio. Judging from his expression, it doesn’t look like good news.
