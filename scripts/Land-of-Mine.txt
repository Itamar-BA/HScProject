'DANGER! MINES.'=>Carl pushes some sand off with his foot. A wooden plank appears beneath the sand. Carl puts his backpack down and digs further up ahead. Another plank appears. Carl puts his backpack back on and walks along the planks down towards the sea. He treads carefully, it is obvious that the entire beach is littered with mines. You can even see some of them poke up through the sand. Carl goes all the way to the water before he stops. He looks down the beach. He pulls a flag out of his backpack and sticks it into the sand. Then we walks along the water. INT. ARMY TRUCK - AFTERNOON CU of young German soldier on the back of an army truck. This is Sebastian . Besides Sebastian are 11 other German boys. We see their faces one by one. Manfred , Werner , Ernst , Helmut , Ludvig , Wilhelm and so on. 12 boys in all. They are just teenagers, nevertheless their youngish faces have a worn-out look to them. Like they have borrowed them from much older, and more experienced men. Hard and weary. The boys all look like they have been starving, some more than others. They are in various types of uniform. All of which are worn and torn. Two of the boys are like two peas in a pod. They are obviously twins. Hidden from the view of the others, they are holding hands. Sebastian peers out through the a gap in tarpaulin cloth that covers the back of the truck. He squints as the setting sun gets in his eyes. The truck is driving along a straight road through a forest near the Danish North Sea coastline.

CARL=>And you two. I take it that you two are brothers?
CARL=>Sorry for what? What exactly are you apologizing for, huh?
WERNER=>I am not sure I ...
CARL=>You may go get some water.
SEBASTIAN=>Absolutely sure, sir!
LUDVIG=>Area number 7, sir.
LUDVIG=>There is one here.
LUDVIG=>What kind of work? ERNST
LUDVIG=>What a fucking pig.
CARL=>What exactly do you think?
WILHELM=>Where are you going?
SEBASTIAN=>Helmut. I need your help. We need to get him off this beach.
WERNER=>What are you doing? Help him, for Christ's sake!! Werner grabs hold of Wilhelm.
SEBASTIAN=>No, like this. Tightly, Okay? You got him?
CARL=>What is up there? KARIN
SEBASTIAN=>Yes, I know. It is horrible. But you have to swallow it. Drink it down. empty those stomachs.
CARL=>Get in the house.
EBBE=>What we are doing? What does it look like, Carl?
SEBASTIAN=>It was for the best, Sergent. SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN=>Good night, sergeant.
CARL=>Stop or I will shoot you!
SEBASTIAN=>Helmut, look at me. It is okay. You hear? It is okay. We need your strength now. I need you. You hear? We must stand by each other now, right?
HELMUT=>It was an act of stupidity. And now we will all pay for it!
HELMUT=>You don't get it, do you? You think he is your friend? He detests you ... all of us! You know the other de-mining units use armored vehicles to check the beaches? But us? We have to walk. You think that is because the sergeant is our friend?
