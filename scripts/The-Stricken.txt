CODY=>Deputy! Deputy Little!
ETHAN=>Not personally.
SHERIFF BANKS=>And the only way to make it your own... is to make it your own.
SHERIFF BANKS=>Then tend to the horses.
TIP TOP=>Holy Christ, look at that!
SHERIFF BANKS=>Whether they know it or-- or not.
ETHAN=>I’m sorry, but we... uh, telegraphed for a doctor?
ETHAN=>...Are you sure?
CHARVEL=>But y’all gonna have to be gentlemanly about this...
ETHAN=>Get back! Everyone back!
MAD CROW HARPER=>Be glad, Mr. Tip Top. Think of all the schoolyards and campfires and saloons that your name will be whispered in now. So very many.
MAD CROW HARPER=>All right. They got yarns to spin.
ETHAN=>Hold it! Hold it there!
HOUSTON=>He wants to lose.
LEADFACE=>What in the hell--
SAXON LAZAR=>I’ve been watching you sittin’ there, smilin’, and foldin’ winning hands all night. And now you win everything back in one hand?
MAD CROW HARPER=>I do hate it when people spoil an ending.
MAD CROW HARPER=>Tell me something, what exactly does a sheriff even do around here? Have you seen the sights lately? This look like a nation of laws to you? Like a nation of anything?
MAD CROW HARPER=>Sorry, Mr. Sheriff! But your tale ain’t obscene enough to pass on!
MAD CROW HARPER=>What are you, the law now?
MOLLY=>It’s not fair...
ETHAN=>Let’s go, Molly.
MAD CROW HARPER=>Not ringin’ any bells yet?
MAD CROW HARPER=>Atta’ boy! The rancher’s kid? The little one you left for dead?
MAD CROW HARPER=>The blood. The horror. The goddamn adventure. My god, I reckon I even wanted to be you at one time. At least shake your hand.
MAD CROW HARPER=>But you’re a hard man to pin down. ‘Specially now. All retired and such. But when push came to shove, your kin, they lead me right to you. Like goddamn destiny.
MOLLY=>I can’t do this!
MAD CROW HARPER=>All right. All right, Mr. Sheriff. You can show ’em, now... Show everyone...
ETHAN=>Go go go go go!
