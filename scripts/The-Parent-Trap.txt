LITTLE KID=>You've already tooken everybody...
HALLIE'S VOICE=>Not everybody.

MARVA, SR.=>Well, if someone's sick, dear, then 1 must go in.-
MARVA, SR.=>Congratulations, ladies ...
MARVA, SR.=>-- That little stunt was the most revolting display of hooliganism ever to take place on these hollowed grounds.
MARVA SR.=>And worst of all, coming from two sisters who should be setting an example for the entire...
MARVA JR.=>I'm afraid the look-alike thing has been the crux of the problem, Chief.
MARVA JR.=>A-men.
MARVA SR.=>That's impossible.
MARVA SR.=>Well, whatever the excuse, I recommend immediate dismissal.
MARVA SR.=>All right, all right... Let me just think...
MARVA JR.=>Uh-oh.
MARVA, SR.=>we've got six weeks left at camp and you two are going to spend every glorious one of them - together. You'll eat together, bunk together and do all your activities together. Either you'll find a way to get along or you'll punish yourselves better than I ever could.

QUEEN ELIZABM=>Good afternoon.
QUEEN ELIZABETH=>What's your name, dear?
QUEEN ELIZABETH=>Yes, I have that effect on people. So nice to meet you, Annie James. Thank you for stopping by the Palace today.
QUEEN ELIZABETH=>That's okay, my dear, I shan't tell a single soul. I promise.
QUEEN ELIZABETH=>Time for me to go. Ta-ta.
PALACE GUARD=>Now that's a first.
CHARLES=>Is that my little girl? That tall gangly thing?
CHARLES=>What are you doing?
CHARLES=>Smelling?
ELIZABETH'S VOICE=>Annie...!
ELIZABETH=>Honey, welcome home!
MARTIN=>I think it looks awesome.
ELIZABETH=>Any other surprises - belly-button rings, tatoos ... ?
ELIZABETH=>What is it, sweetie?
ELIZABETH=>Can you believe it? It seems like it's been forever.
ELIZABETH=>So tell me all about camp.
ELIZABETH=>Nothing's new... it's just as Mom-like as it's always been. So... c'mon, tell 7ne... Did you like everyone? Was it fun?
ELIZABETH=>Yes... Once. But that was a long time ago, before you were born.
ELIZABETH=>Man-o-Manichevitz ... I love your new vocabulary.
MARTIN=>I found a stowaway in your suitcase.
MARTIN=>well, since he's not our 'Cuppy’, shall we dispose of him?
ELIZABETH=>Hello? Hi... Really? Can't you manage without me? Annie just got home from camp... Well, what's the problem?
ELIZABETH=>Annie!
ELIZABETH=>Really? You don't think it's too over-the-top?
ELIZABETH=>Who?
ELIZABETH=>Me? I think the time change has made you a little loopy. Come on, let's see what all the fuss is about...
ELIZABETH=>No, I like things exactly the way they are, thank you.
ASSISTANT=>Hi, Elizabeth. Hey Annie, welcome home. Great haircut.
ELIZABETH=>The ‘F’ word?!
HALLLIE=>You didn't? -Why not?
ELIZABETH=>Oh. That ‘F’ word. Well, no, actually it doesn't because I didn't even wear a wedding gown-when I married the IF' word.
PHOTOGRAPHER=>Okay, she's here.- We're saved.
ELIZABETH=>Uh-huh, the pressure's on.
PHOTOGRAPHER=>We don't know what to do with the veil. if she wears it, it covers the back of the dress, if she doesn't the dress looks--
ELIZABETH=>-- incomplete. Right. Can you try standing sideways..? Head up, kind of an Audrey Hepburn type... that's it. That's perfect. Now slip the veil on and drape it back... not over her shoulders ... straight back, there you go... Now lift the train in your arms like you're carrying it. Don't worry about the bouquet, you're married now, you gotta learn to juggle... Beautiful. And look happy, it's your wedding day!
ELIZABETH=>Why the sudden curiosity about your Dad?
ELIZABETH=>I'm going home, kids ... See you tomorrow.
ELIZABETH=>Who?
ELIZABETH=>Okay. He was quite lovely to tell you the truth. When we met, he was...actually entirely lovely. All right?
ELIZABETH=>Are you cold?
@IE=>I'm fine. so, did you meet him here in London? Elizabeth-takes Hallie's hand as they dash across the street.
ELIZABETH=>We met on the QE 2.
ELIZABETH=>We kind of hit it off immediately.
ELIZABETH=>And since a ship's Captain can do all kinds of special things, like even marry people...
ELIZABETH=>I don't )mow, honey. These things are complicated. I'm very British and you father's very American. I tried living in California, he tried living in London but...
ELIZABETH=>No, it didn't. Except for having you.
NICK=>Hal! Hey, welcome home, kiddo!
NICK=>Get into these arms, you little punk.
NICK=>Great. Everybody's great, can't wait to see you. Eight weeks really is too long, Hal. So much has been happening around here.
NICK=>What's the matter? Did I cut myself shaving?
NICK=>C'mon, squirt, let's go home.
NICK=>Hey, by the way, thanks for all those newsy letters. I'm really glad I bought you all that personalized stationary you just had to have.
NICK=>We?
NICK=>‘Lovely’? You seem to have gotten very Proper all of a sudden. Still biting those nails.
NICK=>Whaddya mean, noticed? You've been biting them since you got teeth.
NICK=>'Lovely' girl ... 'Horrid, habit? Did I send you to summer camp or finishing school? And why do you keep saying 'Dad, at the end of every sentence?
NICK=>Because you missed your old man so much?
NICK=>So, let me see if I get this ... you missed being able to call me Dad.
NICK=>Now you sound like your old self.
JOSE=>Well, look who finally decided to come home.
JOSE=>Did your old man tell you we decided no more camp for you?
JOSE=>it got too quiet around here, Hal. We couldn't stand it. Nobody blasting music, nobody playing hide and seek in the vineyards, nobody getting stuck up on the roof...
CHESSY=>Hell-o, Gorgeous! You grew, you lost weight, you look fabulous, we missed you, don't let these bums talk you out of, going back to camp. You're a growing girl. You need adventure. You hungry? I made cornbread and chili. Why're you so quiet? What's wrong?
CHESSY=>It's on the stove... Wipe your feet, Jose!
CHESSY=>You've changed, Hal ... I can't put my finger on it, but something about you has definitely changed..
CHESSY=>What's with you, goofball! It's Hallie. Sanmy continues BARKING. Annie I probably smell like camp, that's all. Annie runs up the porch steps, followed by Chessy.
CHESSY=>What's wrong with you? it's like you didn't even recognize her.
CHESSY=>Whaddya want to do first, kiddo - unpack or eat? Or eat, then unpack? Or, we can eat while we unpack.
CHESSY=>Yes, I would say that's a definite possibility.
NICK=>Hal, when you're done, come on down, there's someone I want you to meet.
NICK=>Okay, Hal.
CHESSY=>-He didn't tell you?
CHESSY=>Hal, it's none of my business how your father makes a fool out of himself, you understand? He's a big boy, he can do what he wants.
CHESSY=>Her name's Meredith Blake. She's a publicist from San Francisco. Your father hired her at the beginning of the summer to do some publicity for the vineyard and if you ask me, she's done a better job selling herself than the grapes.
CHESSY=>Look, you and I )mow your Dad's no suave debonair Bachelor of the Month-type, so I wonder what a young hot thing like her sees in a guy who walks around with his shirt-tail hanging out and his cereal bowl full of chili. Then I realized, there's a .million reasons why that girl's giggling and they're all sitting in the Napa Valley Community Bank.
CHESSY=>-- What do I know? But I'll tell you one thing. This one could give Sharon Stone femme fatal lessons. She's got your father eating out of the palm of her hand. They ride together, they swim together, they're out to dinner every night. Not to mention she treats yours truly like the shlepper help' of all time which has really endeared her to me, as you can imagine. = you go down and meet her and see for yourself. Don't let me influence you.
NICK=>There's my girl! Hal, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Honey, this is Meredith Blake.
ITH=>Hi. Wow. I can't believe I'm finally meeting the famous Hallie. I've looked forward to this all summer.
MEREDITH=>Nicky, she's adorable.
MEREDITH=>-- Twenty-six.
NICK=>oh, suddenly she's interested in math. I'm gonna get some more chili and a bottle of champagne to celebrate.
MERIDITH=>No, no, I just had to say that to get him out of something. You know I never heard a man talk about his daughter the way Nicky talks about you. You two are obviously incredibly close.
MEREDITH=>Others? What others?
MEREDITH=>The 411?
MERIDITH=>I'm number twenty-nine?!
NICK=>okay, here we go. A bottle of my special reserve label. You girls find something to talk about while I was gone?
NICK=>Does that mean 'yes'?
MERIDIITH=>it sure does. EXT. ELIZABETHIS TOWN HOUSE - LONDON - FOLLOWING MORNING OVER, a
PHONE RINGS.=>INT. FOYER - SAME TIME
ELIZABETH=>Somebody grab that, please.
MARTIN=>James residence... Annie? Hallie walks by. Hallie Yes, Martin?
MARTIN=>oh dear, it sounded just like you on the phone.
MULIE=>Annie, are you still there? I can barely hear you... Ann....
CHESSY=>okay, here we go, most important meal of the day... Eggs sunny side up, bacon, toast and just in case you're really hungry... a stack of humongous chocolate chip pancakes which smell incredible, if I do say so myself. Chessy places all of this in front of Annie.
CHESSY=>He and Miss--
CHESSY=>Uh-huh. So you waited until it was three in the morning her time. That makes perfect sense.
CHESSY=>Very smooth. Your Dad wants you to go over to his office as soon as you're done with breakfast.
CHESSY=>Pull, Hal.
NICK=>Honey, I'm glad you're here, there's something really important I want to talk to you about.
NICK=>Okay, you go first.
NICK=>Okay, I want to talk to you about Meredith.
NICK=>W-W-What about your mother?
NICK=>C'mon, Hal, we've talked about your mother...
MERIDITH=>Hi. Hello, Hal.
MEREDITH=>Hallie, this is my assistant, Richard. Richard, this is Nick's daughter, the one I've been telling you so much about.
RICHARD=>oh, hello. How are you, luv?
NICK=>How'd you do that?
MEREDIITH=>Did you tell her?
NICK=>Almost.
MEREDITH=>Hey, if you're free later, why don't we all have lunch on the terrace?
NICK=>Actually, I promised Hal we'd hang out together this afternoon.
MEREDITH=>No problem. I’ve got plenty to do... I'm working on a new label design , Nicky... featuring Y-0- U. You're gonna love it.
RICHARD=>Oooooooo. Ice woman.
MEREDITH=>And proud of it, babe.
NICK=>What camping trip? The one we go on every summer before you go back to school.
NICK=>So, you excited about our camping trip?
NICK=>So, Hal, what do you think of Meredith?
NICK=>-- Just what do you think of her... as a person?
NICK=>Well, I'll tell you why... because believe it or not, honey...
NICK=>Hallie, I'm trying to tell you something!
CHESSY=>You got something you'd like to share with the class?
CHESSY=>I gave you a fright?
CHESSY=>You sure there's nothing you want to talk to me about? Like maybe why Sammy never comes near you anymore or why your appetite's suddenly changed or why all of a sudden you're neat as a pin and using expressions like, 'You gave me a fright.,
CHESSY=>if I didn't know better, I'd say it's almost as if you were... oh, never mind, that's too impossible.
CHESSY=>Nobody. Nobody. Forget I even mentioned it.
CHESSY=>You know about Annie? Annie I AM Annie. Just then, Nick ENTERS, also a little out of breath.
NICK=>-- Why'd you take off like that? I told you I wanted-to talk to you about something? Chessy, why are you looking at her like that?
CHESSY=>Like what? I'm not looking at her any special way.
CHESSY=>She's so beautiful and so big. Annie gives Chessy a look that says, 'Please don't say anything!
CHESSY=>I'm gonna go make you something special to eat. What would you like? Oh, it doesn't matter. I'll whip up everything we've got.
NICK=>Honey, look... I want to know what you think about making Meredith part of the family?
NICK=>Yes.
NICK=>You do?
NICK=>Hal, calm down. Now you speak French?!?
CHESSY=>Don't look at me, I know nothing.
NICK=>Maybe I am too old for this. Meredith sweeps into the room, wearing sunglasses.
MEREDITH=>Hi, doll.
MEREDITH=>You look stressed, baby. How about a Martini?
NICK=>How about a double?
MEREDIITH=>Chessy?
MEREDIITH=>Don't you love it? it's just what we need. It's such a big house.
MEREDITH=>Two martinis, please. And make Mr. Parker's a double.
NICK=>Please, Chess. I'm getting a migraine...
NICK=>I told Hallie.
MEREDITH=>You did? And?
MEREDIITH=>Nicky, this reaction is totally classic. It's 'Daddy's Getting Remarried - 101'. I'd worry if she didn't react this way. Look, why don't I talk to her... woman to woman.
MEREDIITH=>-
MEREDITH=>Knock-knock. Can I join you?
MEREDITH=>Guess the news of the engagement came as a bit of a shock, huh?
MEREDITH=>You know, I remember what it was like to be eleven. I had my first beau at eleven. It's a wonderful age. You're starting to feel like a woman and believe it or not soon You'll understand what it's like to be in love.
MEREDITH=>Well, take it from someone who got their molars very early in life... being in love is a fantastic mystery that takes a man and woman on a magical journey to a place...
MEREDITH=>You do?
ITH=>Boy, your father underestimates you.
MEREDITH=>So what if I'm young and beautiful? That's not a crime, you know. And for your information, I adore your father. He's exactly-the kind of man I always planned on marrying. This is the real deal, honey and nothing you do is going to come between as. The reality is, angel, you are no longer the only girl in Nick Parker's life. Get over it.
MEREDITH=>I hope you're not suggesting I'm marrying your father for his money.
MEREDITH=>You are unbelievably out of line, young lady.
ELIZABETH=>This is fantastic wine by the way Martin.
ELIZABETH=>I don't think you're going like it.
ELIZABETH=>Honey, are you okay?
ELIZABETH=>of course. Are you okay? Would you like me to come with you?
GRANDFATHER=>What do you say you and I take a little stroll in the park, young lady.
ELIZABETH=>Au, Mademoiselle. I will have the sketch to you by tomorrow. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you. Au revoir.
ELIZABETH=>I have to finish this sketch and Fed Ex it to Paris, then how about you and I go out to lunch and spend the rest of the day getting lost in Harrods?
'ELIZABETH=>You have to go out of town? And where may I ask are you going? Hallie SQUIRMS UNDER THE COVERS, entirely disappearing.
ELIZABETH=>Annie?
HALLIE'S VOICE=>That's where I have to go. I have to go see Annie.
HALLIBIS VOICE=>in Napa with her father, Nick Parker. CLOSE - ELIZABETH
ELIZABETH=>You're Hallie...
ELIZABETH=>oh, honey, I've loved you your whole life. She takes Hallie in her arms.
ELIZABETH=>Why didn't you tell me it was you all along?
MARTIN=>I've never been so happy in my entire life. Grandfather pats him gently. INT. ELIZABETHIS ROOM SAME TIME Hallie and Elizabeth break from their hug. Elizabeth wipes her tears.
ELIZABETH=>Legally, you belong to your father and Annie belongs to me.
ELIZABETH=>I agree, it totally sucks. I don't want to lose you now that we've been together.
ELIZABETH=>I guess we will.
ELIZABETH=>No, of course not.
ELIZABETH=>I'm sorry, I can't handle this'. I haven't seen or heard from Nick Parker in over eleven years and suddenly I'm flying halfway across the world to... I'm not mature enough for this. if the man didn't make me so nuts, I'd still be married to him.
MARTIN=>Actually, Hallie says her Dad's quite the hunk. And never re-married, either. Just like you, ma'am.
ELIZABETH=>Martin, it just so happens I'm not remarried by choice. I've had my opportunities for llamour. Not lately, of course. But I've had my share of gentlemen callers.
MARTIN=>Not lately.
ELIZABETH=>I just said that! Hallie said he was a hunk, huh? He was rather dashing. He used to make me weak in the knees, if you Can imagine that. Is that a grey hair?!
ELIZABETH=>Good. Me too. Almost. Not quite.
ELIZABETH=>Oh. Right. Sorry. Did you speak to your father, dear?
ELIZABETH=>He did? Anxious-nervous, like he's dreading it or anxious-excited like he's looking forward to it?
MARTIN=>Liar, Liar, pants on fire...
ELIZABETH=>Oh, Martin, could you come back for a moment, please?
ELIZABETH=>Martin, I have a really ridiculous, somewhat childish request to make. Martin, you know you're more than a Butler to me. You're like a lovable brother who just happens to wait on us and...
ELIZABETH=>Would you, Martin? I'd be forever grateful. And you don't even have to go as our butler. Just as a friend.
GRANDFATHER=>Bye, Hal.
GRANDFATHER=>I wouldn't miss it for the world.
MEREDITH=>Okay, they'll be here any minute... Be nice, Daddy. He's everything you ever wanted for your little girl... plus millions more.
MR. BLAKE=>Then you know I'll be nice.
MEREDITH=>Okay, there he is... -- with the whole motley crew.
ANGLE THE FRONT ENTRANCE=>Nick, Annie, Chessy and Sammy ENTER the Lobby. Meredith rushes to greet them, kissing Nick.
MEREDITH=>Hi, darling... Hallie, Chessy... And Sammy, what in the world are you doing here? Honey, a dog in The Four Seasons?
NICK=>Hal begged me to bring him.
MEREDITH=>And naturally you said 'yes'. Sammy snaps at Meredith.
CHESSY=>Good doggy. Meredith, these the folks..?
MEREDITH=>Yes! Mom... Dad... finally, you all meet. This is my fiance and the love of my life, Nick Parker and this is his adorable daughter Hallie who we can all thank for bringing us together this weekend... This entire get together was her idea I'll have you know...
MR. BLAKE=>Well, how are you young lady, I've heard nothing but wonderful things about you.
ELIZABETH=>-- You mean you never saw me drink so much vodka before! Guess what? I've got news for you, Marty old chap... never tasted the stuff before. Not once.
ELIZABETH=>Hello, Doorman. Oh, you scared me, I thought you were real for a minute..
'ELIZABETH=>That was a great flight, wasn't it? So quick.
MA.RTIN=>I never saw you so... thirsty, before, ma'am.
MARTIN=>Could've fooled me, ma'am.
ELIZABETH=>Absolutely. Never felt better in my life. But darling, tell me 'cause I'm a bit confused... Have we landed yet?
WHIPS ACROSS THE LOBBY=>where Meredith, her folks, Nick, Chessy, Annie and Sammy EXIT a Dining Room.
MEREDITH=>I've already checked us in, so why don't we go up to the rooms, freshen up, then meet for lunch?
MR. BLAKE=>Sounds good, I'm starved. Meet you back here in ten.
ELIZABETH=>oh, jeez... She sticks out her band and the doors POP BACK OPEN.
ELIZABETH=>-- Forgot my purse.
ELIZABETH=>Honey, you didn't have to wait for me, I could've found the room by myself. Besides ... I've got to make a pit stop. Vodka makes you have to go like crazy... Go on,thweetie, I'll meet you upstairs ... I mean, upthstair... uppth... upppthst... I'll meet thyou up... thstairs! I like that jacket by the way. Were you wearing that the whole time on the plane?
CHESSY=>' Just do what the woman says and meet her upthstairs.
MEREDITH=>Alone at last.
ELIZABETH=>Hallie Parker!
ELIZABETH=>You look beautiful. So tan and healthy...
CHESSY=>.may I suggest we take this little pow-wow inside. Hi, you probably don't remember me...
ELIZABETH=>Chessy!
CHESSY=>I knew I always liked you. INT. HOTEL SUITE - MOMENTS LATER The Girls sit side-by-side.
ELIZABETH=>Let me put this as sucthinkinctly as possible. You... I mean, -- One of you told me your father knew I was arriving here today... And I'm here to tell you the man I just saw in the elevator had absolutely no idea he and I were on the same planet, let alone in the same hotel.
ELIZABETH=>Yeth. And it was completely and utterly humiliating. I gotta lie down... The man went completely ashen. Like I was the bloody ghost of Christmas past. Can one of you get me something cold for my head? Don't you think I've pondered what it was going to be-,like to see your father again after all these years? Well, let me tell you, me waving like a mindless idiot while Nick Parker is wrapped in another woman's arms is not exactly the scenario I had in mind. No sireee... Thank you.
ELIZABETH=>Martin! What are you doing?
MARTIN=>Going for a swim. Do you mind?
ELIZABETH=>No, no, that's perfectly perfect. By all means, yes, have fun... someone ought to. Just put on a shirt... my God...
CHESSY=>Oh... Hell-o.
MARTIN=>Hello, Hello...
ELIZABETH=>Oh, Chessy, this is our butler, Martin.
CHESSY=>How do you do? I'm her butler.
MARTIN=>Enchante, mademoiselle.
CHESSY=>Gee, the pleasure's all mine, monsieur.
ELIZABETH=>Girls! You were going to tell me why you lied and brought me here without telling your father!?!
CHESSY=>Were they? 0-kay, that's good. Well, then why don't I just slip back into my room and check out the ol' mini bar...
MARTIN=>Allow me to assist you...
ELIZABETH=>Wait! You mean everyone knows but me?!? What's going on here?
ELIZABETH=>Oh. I see... getting married...
ELIZABETH=>You're trying to fix me up with your father.
ELIZABETH=>Hold it! You two knew about this?
MARTIN AND CHESSY=>No. Not exactly. We tried to reason with them. What could we do? They made us do it. We're the hired help. Don't fire us. It was a mistake.
ELIZABETH=>okay, let me say this loud and clear. Nick Parker and I have nothing in common... anymore. Plus, in case you haven't noticed, he seems extremely content with his leggy, long haired, tight-skirted fiance. I want the two of you to explain to your father that I am here for one purpose only and that's to switch you two back. Now, let's do what we have to do and be done with it. Understood?
MEREDITH=>No. I don't understand.
MEREDITH=>Clear your head? What do you have to clear your head about? Is something wrong?
NICK=>Ring shopping?
MEREDITH=>Nicky!
MEREDITH=>The funeral?!?
NICK=>I'm kidding.
MEREDITH=>We're still going ring shopping after lunch, right?
NICK=>Of course! For the funeral. I mean, for the wedding.
NICK=>Just running down to the lobby. Hey, Hal, do me a favor, keep Meredith company, willya? Thanks, kiddo.
NICK=>It's great to see you too, squirt. Now go on, get up there.
MEREDITH=>Have you seen your father?
ITH=>What are you, Robert DeNiro? Yes, I'm talking to you.
MEREDITH=>Well, hel-lo? Where was he?
MEREDITH=>What are you staring at?
MEREDITH=>Don't tell me you're going to break your rotten streak and suddenly be nice to me?
NICK=>What are you doing? I thought you were gonna...
NICK=>she wasn't? Oh... okay... See you in a little bit, kid.
BARTENDER=>Here you go. This'll cure anything you got. Just don't ask what's in it.
ELIZABETH=>Okay... Here's to..'
MEREDITH=>Thank you...
MEREDITH=>Martini, dry and a pack of Parliaments. Elizabeth belches.
ELIZABETH=>Excuse me... I apologize. Really, I'm so... -- sorry. I think I just drank tar.
MEREDITH=>You're Elizabeth James?
ELIZABETH=>Guilty.
ELIZABETH=>still guilty.
MEREDITH=>I faxed your office just yesterday. I saw a wedding dress you designed and fell completely in love with it. Your office said you were out of town and they didn't know if you could make another one. I can't believe it. This is fate. I'm Meredith Blake.
ELIZABETH=>How do you do?
MR. BLAKE=>There you are! We've been looking all over for you!
MM. BLAKE=>Nicholas, I think this hotel is perfect for the wedding... The more I see of it, the more I like it.
NICK=>Me too. Absolutely.
MM. BLAKE=>Tell me, dear, how many guests will there be from your side of the family? Just a guesstimate?
NICK=>I'm not sure at the moment... Can I get back to you on that one?
MRS. BLAKE=>Of course, And are we thinking formal attire or...
CHESSY=>Boss, you okay?
ELIZABETH=>Nick, hello... Long time no see... Please try not to go crazy...
NICK=>A little late for that advice. What is going on? I haven't seen or heard from you in eleven years and suddenly you're popping up everywhere I look and naturally on the day I'm--
NICK=>Both of them? Annie... Hallie...
ELIZABETH=>They decided to switch places on us, Nick.
NICK=>Wait a minute. You mean I've had Annie all this time5
NICK=>Honey, of course not. It's just... I can't believe it's you. The last time I saw you... you had diaper rash. Look at you...
NICK=>Hal, you've been in London all this time? Come here.
ELIZABETH=>Girls, why don't you let your father and I talk for a couple of minutes, okay?
NICK=>oh, man, I can't believe this. Seeing them together... and you... and... How are you, Lizzie or does everyone call you Elizabeth now?
ELIZABETH=>No, no, Lizzie's fine. My Dad still calls me Lizzie. I've been terrific. How 'bout you?
NICK=>Well, I've had better days. Ouch!
ELIZABETH=>Let me help you with that? Excuse me, do you have a First-Aid kit?
TOWEL BOY=>Sure.
ELIZABETH=>Okay, lie down...
NICK=>How is your Dad, still sneaking those stogies?
ELIZABETH=>Every day.
NICK=>I can't believe it, you haven't changed at all...
ELIZABETH=>You thought maybe I'd be fat and grey?
NICK=>Well, not grey... Ouch!
ITH'S VOICE=>-- Finally! There you are!
MEREDITH=>Oh. You've met Elizabeth. Good. Honey, Elizabeth's going to make my... wedding gown... But, I don't understand... How did you two meet and why are you so wet?
NICK=>I wasn't paying attention and I...
ELIZABETH=>Nick, I didn't know she was y OUR fiance...
NICK=>How did we meet? How did you two meet?
MEREDITH=>Am I missing something here?
NICK=>Sweetheart, you know what? This is one all world...
MEREDITH=>How small?
AI*IE=>Oh, hi, Mer.
ITH=>Hello.
NICK=>Honey, did I ever mention Hallie was a twin?
MEREDITH=>No, as a matter of fact, you didn't. Two of them?!? How fabulous.
MEREDITH=>This is your mother?
GIRLS=>Yes.
MEREDITH=>You were married to Nick?
ELIZABETH=>Guilty again.
MEREDITH=>well, this is a small world.
NICK=>And getting smaller.
ITH=>And what a coincidence that we're all here on the same exact weekend.
ELIZABETH=>it's not exactly a coincidence. The children arranged it so their father and I could work out their custody situation.
MEREDITH=>The children arranged it? Oh. How sweet.
MEREDITH=>I'm sorry, I just don't see why you have to have dinner with your ex-wife with her little
NICK=>That's not true.
MEREDITH=>Can we have some help over here, please?
NICK=>Honey, calm down. The girls have never had a meal with both their parents in their entire lives. How could I say no?
MEREDITH=>
NICK=>I think I have to get dressed for dinner.
MEREDITH=>Nicky...
NICK=>If you love it. I love it.
MEREDITH=>I love it.
NICK=>Hal, I've had enough surprises for one day... just tell me where we're going...
ELIZABETH=>Hi. So do you know where they're taking us?
NICK=>Hey... Hi.
NICK=>She won't crack.
NICK=>We're going in a limo?
NICK=>And exactly how are we paying for her?
NICK=>The table's only set for two.
ELIZABETH=>You're not?
CHESSY=>No, but I am. Good evening, I'm Chessy, I'll be your server tonight. No wisecracks please.'
MARTIN=>And I'm Martin, your Sommelier. May I offer you both a taste of the bubbly in hopes that you'll get a little snickered and won't can this lovely lady and myself for following the orders of two eleven year-olds...
CHESSY=>Annie, mood music, if you please.
CHESSY=>You don't get it, do you? Smooth Oper-ator...'Big hit in 186 ... The year you two met... Hors d'oeuvre?
ELIZABETH=>So, that's what this is all about.
CHESSY=>The help.
'ELIZABETH=>it's incredibly sweet.
ELIZABETH=>Neither have 1.
NICK=>Well then, here's to...
ELIZABETH=>Our daughters.
NICK=>Martin, I think I'll have that drink. Martin pours them both champagne, then he and Chessy slip away.
NICK=>To tell you the truth, I haven't been on a boat since the -QE2.
NICK=>You know, I always see you in Hallie. I always have. Something about her eyes ...
ELIZABETH=>That's funny. I always see you in Annie. Something about her smile.
NICK=>Now I know how a goldfish feels. ' They turned out pretty good though, huh?
ELIZABETH=>We've been lucky.
ELIZABETH=>It started so fast.
NICK=>Now that part I remember perfectly.
THROUGH ANOTHER PORTHOLE=>Chessy and Martin watch.
NICK=>Sometime, if we're ever really alone maybe we could talk about... what happened between us. It all feels a bit hazy to me now... It ended so fast.
MARTIN=>Looks like things are heating up nicely. I'd say it's safe to serve the vichyssoise.
CHESSY=>You ladle, I'll serve.
CHESSY=>Right. And I’ll...
MARTIN=>serve.
CHESSY=>Right.
ELIZABETH=>So, you've done incredibly well. Your dream of owning your own vineyard... it actually came true.
NICK=>Hey, how about you, always drawing on napkins and corners of newspapers? Now you're this major designer... pretty impressive.
.ELIZABETH=>Yeah, it's amazing. We both actually got where we wanted to go...
NICK=>Yep. We did.
NICK=>So, what do we do about the girls?
ELIZABETH=>Well, I guess now that they've met, we can't very well keep them apart. I could keep them half the year and you could--
CHESSY=>-- Guys, they can't go to two schools every year.
NICK=>I agree.
ELIZABETH=>Okay, I could keep them for a whole year, then you could--
NICK=>-- Liz, this is why we...
CHESSY=>Sorry. Ignore me. I'm gone. She backs out of the room.
NICK=>This is why we came up with the solution we have.
ELIZABETH=>Really? I thought it was because we decided never to see each other again.
NICK=>Not we Lizzie...
ELIZABETH=>You know that part's become a bit hazy for me too over the years. for me too over the years.
NICK=>You don't remember the day you packed?
ELIZABETH=>No, that day I remember perfectly. Did I hurt you when I threw that suitcase? I've often wondered.
NICK=>Let's put it this way, I'll never pitch for the Yankees. So how come you never got married again? I always figured by now you'd be re-married with a new family...
ELIZABETH=>Me? No... no, no... no...
NICK=>That's a lot of no’s..
ELIZABETH=>That's because I realized a long time ago marriage wasn't for me...
NICK=>You know I may be alone with you again, so... About the day you packed... Why did you do it?
ELIZABETH=>Nick, we were getting along so badly, we found out we each had tempers, we said
NICK=>I didn't know I was supposed to.
ELIZABETH=>Well, it really doesn't matter now... Let's put on a good face for the kids, shall we and get this show on the road... Gosh, I'm still on London time, so...
NICK=>Okay. Yeah. You're right. Let's get the show on the road.
ELIZABETH=>All set then. Where's Annie?
MARTIN=>I just called, she's on her way down. Nick and Chessy join them. Everyone's spirits are low.
NICK=>Okay, so 11.11 uh... send Hallie back to you over Christmas.
ELIZABETH=>And I'll see that Annie spends Easter with you.
NICK=>This one's Hallie, I'm positive.
ELIZABETH=>The four of us!?
ELIZABETH=>Or... You do as we say and I take one of you back with me to London whether you like or not.
MEREDITH=>What am I supposed to do for three days sit home and knit?
N=ITH=>Excuse me, what is she doing here?
NICK=>That was the deal - the four of us go together.
MEREDITH=>What are you suddenly, the Brady Bunch? This is ridic--
ELIZABETH=>-- Hi, Meredith. Everything okay?
MEREDITH=>Thank you.
MEREDITH=>Well, no, as a matter of fact, it isn't. I didn't realize you were going on this little outing and to tell you the truth, I'm not so sure I am okay with it.
ELIZABETH=>I agree. The ex-wife in the next sleeping bag is a little weird...
ELIZABETH=>I insist you come with us, really. Meredith stops cold.
NICK=>Liz ...
ELIZABETH=>Nick, I messed-up up your entire weekend, it's the least I can do to pay you back.
NICK=>Your mother invited her. Be nice.
ELIZABETH=>Okay. Have fun everybody.
NICK=>Liz, what are you doing?
ELIZABETH=>I really think you and Meredith need time alone before the big day.
ELIZABETH=>Honestly, you'll have much more fun without me.
MEREDITH=>Look, if you're not going... I don't have to go... Trust me, I'm not exactly a big nature girl.
ELIZABETH=>But this'll be your chance to really get to know the girls... Starting next week, they're half yours.
ELIZABETH=>Have fun yall'!
CHESSY=>I would pay to see that woman climb a mountain.
MEREDITH=>I'm gonna kill my trainer... He says I'm in such great shape... I can't believe people actually do this for fun.
NICK=>Girls, hold on, we're stopping.
NICK=>Meredith isn't used to the altitude... Just chill, okay?
MEREDITH=>Somebody hand me my Evian... I can't move.
NICK=>Honey, you okay?
MEREDITH=>Get it away from me! I hate things that .crawl. It's disgusting... It's a lizard, it should be a belt. Ugh, how can you touch it? Put it down!
NICK=>Why don't I take the lead, you two help Meredith.
MEREDITH=>Sure, you're going to help me... right over a cliff, you'll help me.
MEREDITH=>Not from you, thank you. Don't think I can't see right past those angelic faces. one more trick from you two and I promise I'll make your lives miserable from the day I say 11 do'. Got it?
MEREDITH=>What'd you call me?
NICK=>Are you okay?!? What happened?!
MEREDITH=>Please work... Hello? Hello?
MEREDITH=>I think your mother would prefer if you called me Meredith and no thank you, I do not eat trout... for the thousandth time. I'll wait until breakfast. What are we having?
NICK AND THE GIRLS=>Trout.
NICK=>We always live off the trail up here, it's part of the experience.
MEREDITH=>What's the other part, being eaten to death by mosquitos? You'd think they actually liked this stuff.
NICK=>What is that you're using?
MEREDITH=>That's it. I’m taking a large sleeping pill and going to bed.
NICK=>Sweetheart, what are you doing?
MEREDITH=>I don’t want the mountain lions to... --There are no mountain lions up here, are there?
NICK=>Just cool it.
NICK=>I'm telling you guys, lay off. This isn't her thing, okay? I'm not marrying her because she's Annie Oakley.
MEREDITH=>That feels so nice...
MEREDITH=>Niiiiiick!!!!!!
NICK=>What's she doing in the lake?
MEREDITH=>Here's what's going on, buddy, the day we say I do" is the day I ship those brats off to Switzerland. Get the picture? It's me or them. Take your pick.
NICK=>T-H-E-M. Get the picture?
ELIZABETH=>Back so soon? Did you have fun?
NICK=>What's going on?
NICK=>Them.
MEREDITH=>Excuse me?
NICK=>Starting now. Go.
ELIZABETH=>Where's Meredith?
NICK=>A little?
ELIZABETH=>oh, jeez ... This-is all my fault. If I hadn't suggested she go...
NICK=>-- Tricked her would be more like it. Like mother, like daughters...
ELIZABETH=>I'm really sorry, Nick.
NICK=>Up to your room! I gotta remember to thank them one day.
ELIZABETH=>You're relieved?
NICK=>I think I am. I’m also starving... Chessy around?
ELIZABETH=>She and Martin went off on a picnic around noon... yesterday.
NICK=>Who would've thought my Nanny and you Butler... So, listen, how 'bout I whip us up something to eat?
ELIZABETH=>You know how to cook now?
NICK=>of course, I )mow how to cook. I can make pasta... and pasta... and...
ELIZABETH=>Pasta sounds good.
NICK=>Good night, Ladies!
NICK=>Smells good in here.
ELIZABETH=>Really? I'm just boiling water.
NICK=>oh. Then it must be you... So what are you in the mood for, red or white?
ELIZABETH=>I think red.
NICK=>Follow me...
ELIZABETH=>Oh really?
NICK=>Yeah, I'm a man of limited interests.
NICK=>This is where I keep my private stash. Did you know I also collect wine?
NICK=>Here's a 1921 Burgundy... They say the rain that year made this the best Burgundy ever harvested... Oh wait, you'll appreciate this one...
ELIZABETH=>Vi Day, 1946... incredible.
NICK=>Yeah, I love that... The same wine my parents served at their wedding... a 152 Bordeaux. I think my sister was conceived off this baby.
ELIZABETH=>What's this-one? Where Dreams Have No End... 1983.
NICK=>That one actually took me years to track down.
NICK=>It's the wine we drank at our wedding. I now have every bottle ever made.
ELIZABETH=>Why, where's it from?
ELIZABETH=>You do?
NICK=>I do.
ELIZABETH=>Can we open one?
NICK=>You're the only one I'd drink it with.
NICK=>You okay?
ELIZABETH=>Just got a little dust in my eye...
NICK=>I can offer you a clean sleeve to...
ELIZABETH=>No, no, I'm fine, now. Really.' All better.
NICK=>You don't always have to be so brave, you know.
ELIZABETH=>Oh, but I do, actually...
CHESSY=>Anybody home?
NICK=>Yeah... We're on our way up...
ELIZABETH=>Welcome back... How was the picnic?
CHESSY=>The man is a lot to handle... but a lot of fun. How was the camping trip? Aren't you back early? Are we interrupting anything? We are. Let's go, Marty.
ELIZABETH=>No, no, you're not interrupting anything. Are you hungry? In the mood for some pasta?
CHESSY=>You don't mind? We haven't eaten since Hearst Castle.
NICK=>No, no, it's fine.
ELIZABETH=>I'll set the table for two more...
ELIZABETH=>Okay, then, I guess that's that. We're really off this time.

ELIZABETH=>Thank you.
