CAPTION=>BIOCYTE PHARMACEUTICALS
NEKHOROVICH=>Well, Dimitri. Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires, a villain. Therefore, in our search for a hero, Belairiform, we created the monster, Chimera.
NEKHOROVICH=>I beg you, Dimitri, come to Sydney and accompany me to Atlanta immediately. However we travel, I must arrive at my destination within twenty hours of departure.
CHILDREN=>...We a pocket full of posies. A tissue, a tissue, we all fall down.
CAPTAIN=>We are two and a half hours away from Atlanta, out you window now, we have a great view of the Rocky Mountains.
HUNT=>You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor.
NEKHOROVICH=>Yes, I suppose I'm a bit anxious.
HUNT=>You'll soon be with old friends.
NEKHOROVICH=>I'm with an old friend now, Dimitri.
HUNT=>I'm sorry I couldn't be on your happier circumstances.
NEKHOROVICH=>I'm sorry too. You are sorry and I'm sorry. Did you know Gradski thought about a few?
HUNT=>Did he know before the end that you two had succeeded?
NEKHOROVICH=>Yes, he knew. Just...
HUNT=>... Not in time to see it.
NEKHOROVICH=>No! After you have been infected with Chimera, for twenty hours, nothing can save you. Not even Belairiform.
HUNT=>You can carry them together. Safely?
NEKHOROVICH=>Yes. And you get us to safe place with them in Atlanta, thank God.
CAPTAIN=>This is your captain again. We've experienced a slight, but abrupt drop in cabin pressure. As a precaution, I have released the oxygen masks. Please put them on, sit back and relax, there is nothing to worry about.
NEKHOROVICH=>Are you concerned?
HUNT=>Well, not so far. Just put on your oxygen mask, I'll see what's going on.
NEKHOROVICH=>Okay.
CAPTAIN=>Denver centre, this is Trans Pac two two zero seven, seven four seven heavy. We are unable to maintain cabin pressurisation, initated a descent to one six thousand.
NEKHOROVICH=>God!
NEKHOROVICH=>It seems that we have a problem, Dimitri!
HUNT=>You keep calling me Dimitri. You really shouldn't.
NEKHOROVICH=>Your not Dimitri?
HUNT=>No!
HUNT=>Wallis, hold onto this.
AMBROSE=>Remember to pull the O2 tanks, Gunter.
STAMP=>All done Chief.
WARNING VOICE=>Terrain! Terrain! Pull up! Pull up!
SWANBECK=>Morning Mr. Hunt. Your mission, should you chose to accept it, involves recovery of a stolen item, designated, Chimera. You may select any two team members, but it is essential that the third team member be Nyah Nordoff-Hall. She is a civilian, and a highly capable professional thief. You have forty-eight hours to recruit Miss Nordoff-Hall and meet me in Seville to receive your assignment. As always, should you or any member of your IM Force be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. And Mr. Hunt, the next time you go on holiday, please be good enough to tell us where your going.
FEMALE VOICE=>This message will self-destruct in five seconds.
TITLE MISSION=>IMPOSSIBLE II
HUNT=>I see you've found it.
NYAH=>What are you doing here?
HUNT=>Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
NYAH=>Hmph! Not just a pretty face after all.
NYAH=>Do you mind if I'm on top?
HUNT=>No. Either way works for me.
HUNT=>You'll never find it there.
NYAH=>Damn it! Find what?
HUNT=>His excellent Bvlgari necklace that goes up for auction on Tuesday.
NYAH=>And are you going to tell me where it is?
HUNT=>Far left.
NYAH=>This is very disconcerting.
HUNT=>Hey, you put me here. I just do as I'm told.
NYAH=>Right!
NYAH=>Now, who are you? And what's it going to cost me?
HUNT=>I wouldn't do that!
NYAH=>What?
HUNT=>That!
HUNT=>Tre kilo! Tre kilo!
HOST=>Mr. Kieths, it is you. It is Mr. Kieths, our security engineer. Apologise!
HUNT=>No, no need to apologise. Now Miss Hall, my associate, has your necklace in a very safe place. But obviously we do feel that the alarm should have gone off a little sooner. Isn't that right, Miss Hall?
NYAH=>Oh! Absolutely. Much, much too long I'd say.
HUNT=>With the circumstances, I'd think that we'd recommend that resetting the sensors to respond to a lighter to a lighter load. How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
NYAH=>Perfect!
HUNT=>Shall we?
HUNT=>Miss Hall?
NYAH=>Hmm?
HUNT=>Haven't you forgotten something?
HOST=>What are you trying to do, Senorita? Rob me?
NYAH=>The thought had crossed my mind.
NYAH=>I'm missing something here, aside from my half a million pound necklace. Even if I screwed up the job, I could be walking out of the bloody thing.
HUNT=>At least you walked.
NYAH=>If you weren't going to let me get away with it, then why did you let me go through it?
HUNT=>To see how good you were. I was hoping that we might work together.
NYAH=>Sounds terrific! Mu cha co!
NYAH=>Now, be serious. What ever it is your talking about, you can not possibly want me after tonight's performance.
HUNT=>You didn't do that badly!
NYAH=>You apologising for me? Quite a gentleman.
HUNT=>Not really, I triggered the alarm.
HUNT=>Sorry!
NYAH=>I don't do laundry, cook, or put up with cheeky bastards who set me up on their territories so they can poach on mine.
NYAH=>Hello?
HUNT=>Hi! Would you mind slowing down?
NYAH=>Where did you get this number? I don't even have it?
HUNT=>Would you like it?
HUNT=>Pull over and listen to me, will ya? Just listen.
NYAH=>Listen to what?
HUNT=>I need your help! And then you can use mine.
NYAH=>Your help?! What are you talking about?
HUNT=>I'm talking about Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them all go away.
NYAH=>Oh bloody hell! You're a spy!
NYAH=>If you want me, you gotta catch me!
HUNT=>Whoa!
HUNT=>Having fun?
HUNT=>Sorry!
HUNT=>Sorry!
HUNT=>Watch the road! Watch the road!
NYAH=>What is your name?
HUNT=>Ethan Hunt.
NYAH=>Well, Ethan Hunt. What is it that you want to talk to me about?
HUNT=>A lot more than I thought.
NYAH=>Awfully short notice.
HUNT=>Care to wait a decent interpol?
NYAH=>Who wants to be decent!
HUNT=>What have you got against spies?
HUNT=>This wasn't exactly by the book!
NYAH=>What kind of book do they have?
HUNT=>Oh, they got a book for everything.
NYAH=>So, this thing that these bloke pinched.
HUNT=>I don't know who pinched it. I don't even know what it is?
NYAH=>Then what am I doing here?
NYAH=>What are you suppose to be? A thief to catch a thief?
HUNT=>Sort of!
HUNT=>Damn your beautiful.
SWANBECK=>Espresso, cappuccino?
HUNT=>No thanks.
SWANBECK=>Sit down, sit down!
SWANBECK=>Festivals are a pain in the ass. Honouring their saints by setting them on fire. Let's you know what they think of saints, doesn't it? Damn nearly set me on fire on my way over here. Sorry I barged in on your vacation.
HUNT=>I'm sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
SWANBECK=>Don't be. It wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
HUNT=>Well, you're sorry and I'm sorry!
SWANBECK=>Why did you phrase it like that?
HUNT=>Like what?
SWANBECK=>Your sorry and I'm sorry.
HUNT=>You got to be kidding?
NEKHOROVICH=>Well Dimitri, once again I need your help, just as in the old days, when you saved our lives, saved our very sanity. Dimitri, we have this little problem. Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires, a villain. Therefore, in our search for our hero, Belariform, we created the monster, Chimera. I beg you, Dimitri, come to Sydney and accompany me to Atlanta immediately. However we travel, I must arrive at my destination within twenty hours of departure. I fear that I can not entrust this to no one but you. Dimitri, as we say I am sorry and you are sorry.
SWANBECK=>Do you have any idea what the hell he's talking about?
HUNT=>An idea? Yep!
SWANBECK=>Like?
HUNT=>Like, it's a good to pick him up in a hurry, but a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. Is he still in Sydney?
SWANBECK=>Doctor Vladimir Nekhorovich is dead, so is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier. We had Nekhrovich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockys.
HUNT=>Dead?!
SWANBECK=>Are you listening to me?
HUNT=>If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on that flight?
SWANBECK=>Oh, you were there!
SWANBECK=>When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He doubled you two or three times?
HUNT=>Twice!
SWANBECK=>What did you think of him?
HUNT=>We had our reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late in the day to be askin' me that?
SWANBECK=>No, not necessarily. Airline records.
SWANBECK=>Mr. Captain Harold Macintosh is the pilot of the flight 2207. As the media and government agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh died in the flight. Infact, he missed it, but he did however make the next flight in cargo, stuffed into a rather small suitcase considering his size.
SWANBECK=>Now, someone on that flight planned an operation designed to bring the plane down and make it look like an accident. Someone skilled enough to bring the whole thing off the ledge.
HUNT=>So there is one thing that we know that Ambrose doesn't!
SWANBECK=>And you do think it was Ambrose. Your not surprised.
HUNT=>Ambrose feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
SWANBECK=>The question is "Why?". What was this "Chimera" that Nekhorovich was carrying.
HUNT=>Only Ambrose knows that.
SWANBECK=>Then in case, you must recover this "Chimera" and bring it to us.
HUNT=>In order to do that he figures out to make money.
SWANBECK=>That is where Miss Hall comes in.
HUNT=>Excuse me?
SWANBECK=>Miss hall and Ambrose had a relationship, which she took very seriously. She walked away and he has been wanting her back ever since. I believe that she is the surest and quickest way of finding him.
HUNT=>And then what?
SWANBECK=>Make sure she continues to see him, gets him to confide in her and report to you.
HUNT=>You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for skills as a thief.
SWANBECK=>Well then I miss lead you or you made the wrong assumption, either way, we are asking her to resume her prior relationship not doing anything she has already done. Voluntarily, I might add.
HUNT=>No she's got no training for this kinda thing.
SWANBECK=>But to go to be with a man and lie to him, she's awomen, she's got all the training that she needs.
HUNT=>I don't think I can get her to do it.
SWANBECK=>You mean it will be difficult?
HUNT=>Very!
SWANBECK=>Well, this is not Mission Difficult, Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible. Difficult should be a walk in the park for you. I'm open to suggestions if you can think of a quicker way to Ambrose, your welcome to try. By the way, you might want to look at these if you have any further problems about her getting to do the job.
NYAH=>How many people are capable of something like that?
HUNT=>Sean Ambrose for one!
NYAH=>Hmph! Right!
HUNT=>This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
NYAH=>But it is what you'd like me to do.
NYAH=>What? Oh, let my conscience be my guide, is that it?
HUNT=>Something like that!
NYAH=>I don't have a conscience. I'm a bloody thief. Are you going to try to force me to do this?
HUNT=>Generally, I don't favour coursing someone not when there's a chance my life can end up in their hands.
NYAH=>Is that the only reason?
HUNT=>Can you think of a better way?
NYAH=>Me? No! But I was just hoping you might thinking somewhere in this course of business that this got personal as well as physical.
HUNT=>Would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
NYAH=>Yeah, much better!
HUNT=>Then feel better.
NYAH=>You know, Sean will never be anything but suspicious if I said "Hey honey, I'm home".
HUNT=>What wouldn't make him suspicious?
NYAH=>That I needed him in some urgent way! Destitute. In serious trouble, the guy can not possibly sort out myself.
HUNT=>Serious trouble, Nyah! Something I can always arrange.
HUNT=>This transponder chip is completely untraceable.
HUNT=>It transmits your location to a satellite which can be read by only this computer.
HUNT=>We can track you within three feet.
HUNT=>Since you arrest and in sending news bulletins to every law enforcement agency in the world.
HUNT=>I know Sean Ambrose. I guarantee after that airline crash, he's monitoring everywhere. He knows your out there, and he has the means to get you out.
HUNT=>Nyah! Nyah! I'm not going to lose you.
BAIRD=>Ethan Hunt! G'day mate, I'm William Baird but Billy is okay. If there's anything you need, move or watch, just let me know and I'm your man. I'll go have a look around. Har har!
STICKELL=>Shit!
HUNT=>Yes it is!
STICKELL=>This ain't funny! I paid for these eighth hundred dollar shoes and you got me in a chopper with this man.
STICKELL=>Computer's up! I got her!
HUNT=>Let us put in the coordinates, get a visual.
HUNT=>Visual is not coming up.
STICKELL=>The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
BAIRD=>Yeah, I heard about you, Luther. I just want to say that it's an honour and a pleasure to be working with you blokes.
HUNT=>Come on, isn't there any way to speed this up?
STICKELL=>With what? This is the only computer that will do this.
STICKELL=>Ethan! Here we go!
BAIRD=>Hey! Now there's a bloke who knows how to give a proper welcome.
BAIRD=>I don't wanna get you wrong mate, but you were very friendly also. Is it him then?
STICKELL=>It's him Billy!
BAIRD=>Yeah, so we got him!
HUNT=>We don't know what we got! Because we don't know what he's got, where he's got and what he's doing in Sydney with it.
AMBROSE=>Not much luggage.
NYAH=>I left in a bit if a hurry. I'm trying to be grateful, Sean. How in the world did you find me?
AMBROSE=>How I usually find you, Nyah. Magic!
WALLIS=>No flies on her, no bugs either, no transmissions. She's clean.
STAMP=>All cats are!
NYAH=>Your bedroom! My bedroom?
STICKELL=>She did it! She's in the compound!
HUNT=>Yeah! We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into hell. Now we'll see what chance it has.
AMBROSE=>Try it on.
AMBROSE=>Go ahead.
AMBROSE=>I'm dying to see if I remembered your size.
NYAH=>You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
AMBROSE=>Oh, I am. Later.
NEKHOROVICH=>Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires...
NEKOVICH=>...a villain, therefore in our search for our hero, Belairiform, we created a monster, Chimera.
STICKELL=>Nekhorovich was a molecular biologist, why is he going on about and old Greek myth?
HUNT=>Nekhorovich specialised in recombining DNA molecules. And the myth, Belairiform was a prince who killed the Chimera. A monster with a head of a lion and a tail of a serpent, that plagued the ancient world. I think Nekhorovich created a monster virus in Chimera. And you need an anti virus to kill it called Belairiform.
STICKELL=>That simple, huh?
HUNT=>Why not?
AMBROSE=>Thirty-seven million pounds. Well that's a promising bid for Nekovich's work. Don't look so worried Hugh, we're half way there.
AMBROSE=>We'll need that at the track, if we're going to get the other half.
AMBROSE=>Well then, all sorted!
STAMP=>Not everything!
STAMP=>Why do you think she's really here?
AMBROSE=>From her point of view or mine?
STAMP=>She wasn't exactly gagging for you when she left you six months ago. The question is do you trust her?
AMBROSE=>Well it considers her timing of course. Getting nicked within a week of the plane going down. Suggestive even boarder line suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
STAMP=>Well, you thought about it at that rate.
AMBROSE=>Tell me Hugh, you don't exactly hang on Nyah's every word and gesture, do you?
AMBROSE=>That's a very ratty nail there.
STAMP=>Sean, please!
AMBROSE=>Suppose she is a Trojan horse sent in by IMF to spy on us. Why shouldn't I have the pleasure of a ride or two? Or you think I can't learn from her more than she can learn from me?
STAMP=>I do! I do! I do! I do!
AMBROSE=>Hugh, you must realise that some of us have pedantic more sex to do with. I may or may not know why she think she's here, but I wanted to take the risk because you, I am gunning for it.
AMBROSE=>Darling, you won!
NYAH=>Well, I suppose I did.
AMBROSE=>Who did you pick that time?
NYAH=>Thief in the line.
AMBROSE=>Say no more!
AMBROSE=>I'm going to grab a drink. Do you still favour those Berlinis?
NYAH=>Mmmm!
BAIRD=>Naturally Vain!
NYAH=>Pardon me?
BAIRD=>Naturally Vain, in the fourth. Check her out, she's cute.
HUNT=>You can speck as if I'm right by your side.
NYAH=>Where are you?
HUNT=>Manet enclosure, just off the track, two O'clock.
HUNT=>How is it going?
NYAH=>Just like old times!
HUNT=>Just like old times?
NYAH=>Just about!
HUNT=>Tell me who you ran into a Ambrose's.
NYAH=>Near as I can tell, there is about half a dozen other blokes about...
NYAH=>...the place, maybe more.
NYAH=>Hugh Stamp, old friend of Sean's, he's the only one I recognise, and a bit of a creep.
HUNT=>We know him. He's over your left shoulder looking at you right now.
NYAH=>Ambrose has photos of news papers with money piled on them, thirty-seven million on the London Times, what's that about?
HUNT=>Bids for possible Chimera virus.
BAIRD=>Ambrose is meeting some bloke in a bar...
BAIRD=>...ginger hair. They're into something.
HUNT=>Who is this guy?
STICKELL=>Checking now, Ethan!
STICKELL=>John McCloy, CEO BioCyte Pharmaceuticals...
STICKELL=>1989, acquired BioCyte in a ...
STICKELL=>...hostile takeover.
HUNT=>He was Nekhorovich's boss!
STICKELL=>Right! He worked with him as a research scientist at BioCyte.
STICKELL=>Ambrose is showing something to...
STICKELL=>...McCloy on a digital camera.
HUNT=>Whatever McCloy is looking at, he's not to happy about it.
STICKELL=>Ambrose just pulled the camera's memory card andput it in an envelope.
STICKELL=>Put it in his inner-left jacket pocket.
HUNT=>Confirm left jacket pocket.
STICKELL=>Roger that!
HUNT=>Nyah, now Ambrose is on his way back to you. There's an envelope inside his...
NYAH=>...left jacket pocket.
HUNT=>That's right!
NYAH=>Where do I meet you?
HUNT=>Betting table twelve, off the paddock.
HUNT=>Are you sure you're up to this?
NYAH=>I'll run it through.
NYAH=>There you are!
AMBROSE=>Who else would you like?
NYAH=>Naturally Vain! They're about to close the betting and haven't a bean.
AMBROSE=>Nyah!
NYAH=>Would you mind terribly?
AMBROSE=>Not at all! But, um, you are going to pay for it and with interest.
NYAH=>I have no doubt.
AMBROSE=>Hold on!
AMBROSE=>Put down a thousand for me!
NYAH=>To win?
AMBROSE=>Why else!
HUNT=>Billy, make sure that...
HUNT=>...Nyah isn't followed!
BAIRD=>No worries mate!
HUNT=>Luther, digital camera, ready to transmit, betting table twelve.
BAIRD=>Oh! Sorry about that, mate! That must of...
STAMP=>Say again!
STAMP=>Where ever you are about in future next time, watch you step. You don't know who you might run into.
STAMP=>So where's the loo?
STAMP=>Thanks, mate!
HUNT=>How'd you do?
HUNT=>Don't turn around.
NYAH=>I managed.
HUNT=>You turned around.
NYAH=>What are you going to do, spank me?
STICKELL=>I'm booted up! Go Ethan!
HUNT=>Are you getting this?
STICKELL=>Sergei Gradski, twenty hours after exposeure.
STICKELL=>God!
BAIRD=>Stamp's out of the loo. He coming to the table, heading your way, mate!
HUNT=>I want you out of Ambrose's place.
NYAH=>What are you talking about? What did you see?
BAIRD=>Okay, he's coming right behind you, Ethan.
HUNT=>You've done your job, now I want you out ofAustralia.
BAIRD=>Thirty steps.
NYAH=>How do you suggest I go about it?
BAIRD=>Twenty, nineteen.
HUNT=>That's so hard, your over whelmed, you need to think it over.
BAIRD=>Fifthteen, fourteen.
HUNT=>I want you out of here with in an hour. Give me your earpiece.
BAIRD=>Nine, Ethan, eight!
HUNT=>If you don't get out of here, I'm coming into get you.
BAIRD=>Ethan, get out of there.
STAMP=>Place your bet, madam?
NYAH=>Just!
AMBROSE=>Come on! Come on!
AMBROSE=>You picked another winner.
STAMP=>I thought you are out for dinner?
AMBROSE=>Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
STAMP=>Where is it?
AMBROSE=>My jacket pocket.
AMBROSE=>My right jacket pocket.
AMBROSE=>We've got a great opportunity here, I'm not going to waste it.
NYAH=>Sean?
NYAH=>Sean?
NEKHORVICH=>A visit from an old friend.
NEKHORVICH=>Died certainly, but dead is a little extreme. On the other hand, when my colleague, Gradski had your pulse and your blood pressure, he had less than a day to live. You're infected with Chimera, my friend.
NEKHORVICH=>No use, my friend. Medical staff wants no part of this. Doctors don't fit the idea of dying any more than anyone else.
NEKHORVICH=>That's what exactly Gradski said, twenty-seven hours before he died.
NEKHORVICH=>My, my, my!
NEKHORVICH=>And what about Gradski, who you deliberately infected with Chimera.
NEKHORVICH=>By asking me!
NEKHORVICH=>You know, I think it's a little late for tat. Do give my regards to Gradski, if you see him.
NEKHORVICH=>Well...
HUNT=>... all I need to hear.
HUNT=>Nyah! It's imperative that we do nothing to alarm Ambrose.
NYAH=>What? You told me to get out of there as soom as possible. And you're coming here to collect me, I was so relieved.
HUNT=>Shh! Shhh! Listen to me, there's no time to talk. It's critical, absolutely critical, that you do what ever Ambrose says. Do you understand me?
HUNT=>Don't worry, it'll all be over, very soon.
HUNT=>That's a promise. Off you go!
HUNT=>Luther, we know this much. Nekhorvich gets on a plane to go to the centre for disease control in Atlanta. He's carrying a virus he created, Chimera, and a cure for that virus, Belairiform. Ambrose doesn't have the virus.
STICKELL=>That's why Ambrose needs McCloy!
HUNT=>So we go into BioCyte, kill Chimera, Ambrose has a cure without a disease and we're home free.
STAMP=>You were right! Hunt stung McCloy tonight. So he knows, they'll be going into BioCyte.
AMBROSE=>Good! So we'll know where he'll be, don't we? Well done, Hugh, well done!
BAIRD=>Oi! You're home, mate! Home!
BAIRD=>He's gone home sick, touch of the flu.
HUNT=>Building up and running?
HUNT=>That's not exactly it?
STICKELL=>Sorry, but this is a BioCyte facility. The storage structure. I'll have it up in a minute.
STICKELL=>Okay, take a look at this.
HUNT=>Start from the inside out.
STICKELL=>All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor.
AMBROSE=>Hunt's target will be the Chimera, stored and manufactured at BioCyte on the forty-second floor. If you looked at Hunt's operation history, and I have, he invariably favours misdirection over confrontation. He'll never break into BioCyte from the bottom where security is heaviest.
STICKELL=>No garage entrances, lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
HUNT=>Not going in from the ground. Show me the atrium.
STICKELL=>The atrium, one of a kind. Runs down through the centre of the building. Provides twenty-four hours of natural light via mirrors and daylight storage cells, optimum growing conditions for the virus. Ends in a glass floor which doubles as a part of the labs ceiling.
STICKELL=>Uh ah! The atrium roof closes at sun down. If the louvres are up for more than forty seconds at night, the civil alarm will be tripped, even those I can't stop. Ethan, we got a total of forty seconds to get you in and the cables out.
AMBROSE=>No! Hunt will prefer to enter BioCyte somewhere from the top where security os minimal. He'll engage in some aerobatic insanity before harming a hair on a guard's head.
HUNT=>Luther, how we doin'?
STICKELL=>Not there yet, Ethan. I'll give you the word.
HUNT=>Billy, ready to go?
BAIRD=>Okay, make your way in five...
STICKELL=>I'm not ready yet! The louvres aren't moving!
BAIRD=>Come on, Luther, we gotta go!
STICKELL=>Wait, there's a glitch in the access code.
BAIRD=>Luther, we're out of time. On the count.
STICKELL=>Please baby, open up!
BAIRD=>Five... four...
STICKELL=>Come on!
BAIRD=>Three...
BAIRD=>Two... one...
HUNT=>I'm going down!
STICKELL=>Ethan, wait!
STICKELL=>Twenty five... twenty four... twenty three...
STICKELL=>Twenty two... twenty one... twenty...
STICKELL=>Ethan, you've got nineteen seconds to clear the cable.
BAIRD=>Retracting cable.
BAIRD=>Come on! Come on!
STICKELL=>Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
BAIRD=>Cable's clear.
STICKELL=>Transponder activated. Reading package and cable clear.
AMBROSE=>He'll breach the lab at the only possible time, wether you break in from the ground or the roof. It's twenty hours one minute when the air filtration generators will cover the sound of Hunt's break in and the rotating guards make the building vulnerable to our break in from below.
STICKELL=>Ethan, the generators are about to go active.
STICKELL=>Just a friendly reminder we'll be out of contact for the eight minutes.
AMBROSE=>I'm betting Hunt will destroy Chimera rather than intend to preserve any part of it. He'll have to do it in two places. The incubation room, where the growth vials are kept.
AMBROSE=>And finally, in the inoculation chamber holding the last Chimera virus in three injection guns.
AMBROSE=>He won't be allowed to destroy the virus in those guns.
RECEPTIONIST=>What's this? You're on time for once?
STAMP=>Not exactly, sport!
STICKELL=>Billy, I think we have a problem! Nyah's on the wing, up early. Billy, do you copy?
BAIRD=>Yeah, I gotcha, Luther! Say exactly where is she?
STICKELL=>In the building!
BAIRD=>Say again, mate! Sounds like you'd said she's in the building?
STICKELL=>I am, she is!
BAIRD=>Well, then. She's not likely to be alone then, is she?
STICKELL=>She's in the elevators heading towards Ethan. The question is how many of them. I can't get through to Ethan, not till the generators go off.
BAIRD=>When's that?
STICKELL=>Not for another five and a half minutes.
COMPUTER=>Chimera in vitro pH and temperature levels outside optimal range . Chimera Working seep stop pH at critical level. Alert, Chimera stop life threatened. Alert, Chimera stop life terminated.
STICKELL=>Come on, Ethan! Come on!
COMPUTER=>Subject is contaminant free. Zero contaminant factor.
BAIRD=>Come on! Come on!
BAIRD=>What the hell can we do?
STICKELL=>What can we do! Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
AMBROSE=>Get him!
BAIRD=>How much longer before you can reach him?
STICKELL=>We got twenty nine seconds before the generators turn off and Ethan will be back on line.
STICKELL=>Ohhh!
BAIRD=>Luther! Luther!
AMBROSE=>Hold your fire! Hold your fire, damn it!
AMBROSE=>Well, Hunt. How've you been?
HUNT=>Fighting a bit of a cold.
AMBROSE=>Oh! You know, that was the hardest part of wanting to portray you. You're running like an idiot every fifthteen minutes.
HUNT=>I thought the hardest part was curing that oppressed need of yours to get your gun off. You were in such a hurry to knock off that seven four seven, you never figured out what Chimera really was.
AMBROSE=>I knew what it was!
HUNT=>Ohh! Then you knew the only way that Nekhorvich could smuggle the live virus was by injecting himself. Using his own bloodstream as a Petrie dish, you knew that while you were knocking him off, destroyed the very thing you came for.
AMBROSE=>STOP! Put a sock in it! And the bloody gun, you'll spread the virus all over the place.
HUNT=>There it is, guys! The last of it! What's the top bid?
AMBROSE=>Why? Can you make me a better offer?
HUNT=>Thirty-seven million pounds? Not really!
AMBROSE=>Oh! Somebody has been slipping you our mail. Come out here you bad girl.
HUNT=>Sean, she doesn't belong here! Let her go!
AMBROSE=>She wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.
AMBROSE=>From this moment, you are responsible for what happens to her. And if you're looking out for her well being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the injection gun and bring it to me. Ball's in your court, Hunt.
STICKELL=>Nyah's in the building. Do you copy?
HUNT=>Thank you!
HUNT=>How do you know he won't shoot you the minutes hes got it?
AMBROSE=>I can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions, you know women make. Like monkeys they are, won't let go of the last branch till they get a grip on the next.
AMBROSE=>Get it Nyah. I'll cover you.
AMBROSE=>I am waiting!
NYAH=>Things haven't exactly worked out the way they thought they would, Ethan.
NYAH=>Sorry!
AMBROSE=>Bitch!
NYAH=>Your not gonna shoot me Sean. Not this bitch, because she's worth thirty-seven million pounds.
HUNT=>What were you think you were doing?
NYAH=>I wasn't thinking. Just trying to stop you from getting hurt, that's all.
HUNT=>You who don't have a conscience.
NYAH=>I guessed I lied!
NYAH=>You can't get us both out of here?
NYAH=>I'm infected with Chimera. You know you don't have a choice. Do it! Do it, now!
HUNT=>We've got nineteen hours and fifty eight minutes. I'll get Belairiform into your system before them.
HUNT=>Just stay alive. I'm not going to lose you.
AMBROSE=>Fell like pleading for your life?
AMBROSE=>Well then, how about dying, so you cake me a lot of money.
AMBROSE=>In just a few hours time, you can be assured of going down in history as a typhoid miliaria of Oz. G'day.
STICKELL=>There's not a chance in locating Nyah, until I can access the satellite. And there's not a chance in doing that until I get this computer fixed and that's taking a while. How much time does she have left?
HUNT=>Not long. But whatever happens, Nyah will take care of Nyah.
BAIRD=>What do you mean?
HUNT=>If we don't get the Belairiform. Nyah will kill herself. So, first things first.
BAIRD=>Ethan, Ambrose and his tam have arrived over the bridge and...
BAIRD=>...Nyah's not with him, mate!
HUNT=>Copy that!
BAIRD=>You alright, mate? Looks like pretty heavy security from here. What's it look like from there?
HUNT=>Risky!
GUARD=>Simon! Simon!
GUARD=>Stay here!
HUNT=>Breaching structure, ten O'clock reading.
SCIENTIST=>It's a DNA match. The blood's loaded with Chimera.
SCIENTIST=>And they certainly have Belairiform.
AMBROSE=>Not exactly! We don't want just your cash.
AMBROSE=>Stock, Mr. McCloy. Stock options to be a little more precise.
AMBROSE=>Cut her loose, right in the centre of town. The more crowd, the better.
STICKELL=>Ethan, just picked up an Ambrose call. Nyah's been dropped off. I think she still alive.
HUNT=>Where is she?
STICKELL=>Somewhere in Sydney.
HUNT=>Somewhere is Sydney? Gotta hardened target?
STICKELL=>I can't until I get the GPS up on our computer. It's still down.
HUNT=>The clock is ticking.
AMBROSE=>How quickly can you manufacture more of the anti- virus?
AMBROSE=>Good! BioCyte stock is just a few weeks away from going through the roof!
AMBROSE=>An outbreak of Chimera.
AMBROSE=>Down town Sydney, for a start. You create the supply, McCloy, we've just created the demand. Three million people in Sydney and seventeen million people in Australia are going to need Belairiform within the next few days. Not to mention the rest of the world. Now, this is how it's going to work. Wallis, shares are standing are...
WALLIS=>Ninety three point four million.
AMBROSE=>Which means, Mr. McCLOY, we need to get our hands on 480,000 options. We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options. Your stock has never sold above thirty-one dollars a share. When your stock goes north over two hundred, which it will, those options will be worth billions and I will own fifty one percent of BioCyte.
AMBROSE=>Sit down!
AMBROSE=>You'll be a billionaire. It's better than being broke. And I have terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies waiting in line.
AMBROSE=>The ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy!
AMBROSE=>Run that bastard down!
AMBROSE=>We're running out of time, Mr. McCloy! We've go to conclude our business.
AMBROSE=>Follow him and let me know!
STAMP=>Raise your hands slowly!
HUNT=>Sure you want me to do this?
STAMP=>Raise your hands! Very slowly.
STICKELL=>Ethan. Ethan, do you copy?
AMBROSE=>Keep it going!
STAMP=>Sean, this rat has reached the end of the maze.
AMBROSE=>Is he alive?
STAMP=>Yep! More or less!
AMBROSE=>Bring him to me!
STICKELL=>Go!
WALLIS=>Sean, transfer completed!
AMBROSE=>Well done, Stamp. Well done!
AMBROSE=>Stop mumbling!
STAMP=>I'm afraid he has no choice. I believe I broke his jaw.
AMBROSE=>Stamp, I'm impressed. Right, we don't have a lot of time so whatever you got to say, say it now! How about a big smile?
AMBROSE=>No?!
AMBROSE=>Get down on your knees!
AMBROSE=>Now, this is what is known as "getting your gun off".
AMBROSE=>Huuuuuuuunnnnt!!!!
BAIRD=>There he is!
BAIRD=>Ethan!
HUNT=>Just back off and pin point our positions.
HUNT=>Luther, clear the bridge for me!
AMBROSE=>Hunt's headed for the bridge, coming in a twelve o'clock, hide!
STICKELL=>Oh! I'm mad now!
BAIRD=>Are you alright, mate?
STICKELL=>That punk put a hole in my Versaci.
STICKELL=>Ethan, the computer's up. I've got Nyah, she's moved out of the city. She's on the north head block, approaching the cliffs, but I can't get a visual.
HUNT=>Help me! She's only got a little time left. Track ahead and pick her up.
SHOOTER=>I can't get a good shot!
STICKELL=>We won't be able to cover you!
HUNT=>My earpiece is failing. You got me on GPS. Bring her to me.
STICKELL=>Billy, north head block. Haul ass!
WALLIS=>God damn it! Keep firing!
SHOOTER=>I can't see anything!
STICKELL=>Range is two kay.
AMBROSE=>Go ahead! Use it, Hunt! Not a bad way to go. It's a lot better than that bitch is going to die!
BAIRD=>Hey! There she is!
AMBROSE=>Hunt! You should've killed me!
SWANBECK=>Miss Hall's blood it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus, not even antibodies.
HUNT=>I gathered as much.
SWANBECK=>But you were under specific instructions, Mr. Hunt, to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus. I'll be very interested to know how, after you managed it's recovery, it subsequently got destroyed.
HUNT=>By fire. It's the best way, really!
SWANBECK=>Ohhh! Well Mr. Hunt, as for Miss Hall and enlight of her efforts, her criminal record will be expunged, wiped out. I'm assuming you approve?
HUNT=>I do.
SWANBECK=>Where is she now by the way? Any ideas?
HUNT=>I don't know. Not exactly.
SWANBECK=>So, what are your plans?
HUNT=>I don't know. Some sought of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.
SWANBECK=>Don't have to do that, it wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
HUNT=>Let's get lost.
-FACTS-=>1- The Biocyte building is actually a normal office block. The louvres don't exist, neither does the atrium. It's all blue screen work. Sorry to disappoint you!
