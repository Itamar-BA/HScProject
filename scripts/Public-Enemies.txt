HAMILTON=>Time.
TURNKEY=>Morning.
PIERPONT=>Line up! Line up ... I'll blow your damn head off!
TURNKEY=>You just got paroled out of here. When was that?
DILLINGER=>Eight weeks ago.
TURNKEY=>Dillinger? John Dillinger?
DILLINGER=>That's right. My friends call me "John". But a sonuvabitch screw like you better say "sir" to me. "Yessir, Mister Dillinger."
RED/DILLINGER=>Against the wall! Get your hands up! Get'em up! Branky! Open the goddarm gate or I'll blow you in half!
MAKLEY/VAN METER=>Undress! Get your damn clothes off!
DILLINGER=>Walter, there's a black Nash out front ... You guys hit the front gate? You guys are on your own.
SHOUSE=>Hurry up! C'mon!
SHOUSE=>You eyeballing me, you son of a bitch?
DILLINGER=>Shouse!!
DILLINGER=>Walter!
DILLINGER=>Walter's dead 'cause of you, you dumb son of a bitch!
SHOUSE=>Bastard wouldn't do what he was told, Johnny .... Pete? Homer?
VAN METER=>Let him have it.
PIERPONT=>Up to you. Dietrich was your pal.
DILLINGER=>How far's the farm?
HAMILTON=>2.6 miles.
PIERPONT=>Okay ... ? Let's go ...
VAN METER=>Burn those ... okay honey?
DILLINGER=>Thank you, ma'am.
EDWIN NORRIS=>She's Miss. That's my daughter, Viola. That'll be eight dollars.
EDWIN NORRIS=>Can't change that ...
DILLINGER=>Well, then, keep the change.
VIOLA=>Take me with you, mister.
DILLINGER=>I'm sorry, honey.
HAMILTON=>Kid didn't fool with anything, did he?
HAMILTON=>Johnny? All there?
DILLINGER=>All here. Let's go to Chicago and make some money.
PURVIS=>Floyd! Halt!
BAUM=>Look out, Melvin!
PURVIS=>Pretty Boy Floyd ... You're under arrest.
FLOYD=>I'm Charles Floyd. Who are you?
PURVIS=>Melvin Purvis Bureau of Investigation. Where's your friend Harry Campbell?
FLOYD=>Ain't gonna tell you shit.
FLOYD=>And I believe you have killed me. So you can go and rot in hell, you sonofabitch.
SPORT=>He jus' pulled in.
CAROLE=>Johnny!
DILLINGER=>Hey, Red, call Oscar.
HAMILTON=>Okay. And Berman? Wanna switch-out the "shorts"?
DILLINGER=>Get a Chrysler and an Essex. Hi, doll ... missed you like nobody's business.
DILLINGER=>Get a hold of Marty?
CAROLE=>Sure did ... Put me down!
VAN METER=>Where those gals?!
DILLINGER=>... main spring's too tight. Jammed twice, Oscar.
OSCAR=>... I cut off one coil.
DILLINGER=>And it rides up and to the right.
OSCAR=>I widen port ...
PIERPONT=>Hiya Harry ...
ZARKOVICH=>Johnny! How are ya?
DILLINGER=>Good and so are you. Christmas is coming early this year. Extra cake's in here for you and Anna. Still in Hammond, doll?
ANNA SAGE=>I'm in Chicago on North Halstead now. Come on by ...
DILLINGER=>Marty, tell me that me and my boys are okay ...
ZARKOVICH=>Long as you stay in East Chicago, you're in safe haven.
CAROLE=>Wanna go out for a few drinks and some laughs ... ?
DILLINGER=>No. I want to sit here with you, baby, stay home and listen to the radio ...
MCKELLAR=>Why do we need this?
HOOVER=>Because this government must wage a war on the wave of crime and lawlessness sweeping across this land.
MCKELLAR=>So you're looking for a budget increase to build up your department. But by my tally your Bureau of Investigation spends more taxpayer's dollars catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first place ...
MCKELLAR=>Across this land, are people who've lost their life's savings and have no jobs and by my tally, Director Hoover, you want to spend more taxpayers dollars catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first place ...
HOOVER=>That's ridiculous. The Bureau's apprehended kidnappers, bank robbers, who have stolen up to ...
MCKELLAR=>Really? How many criminals you apprehended?
HOOVER=>We've arrested and arraigned 213 wanted felons ...
MCKELLAR=>No. I mean you. How many?
HOOVER=>As Director I administer ...
MCKELLAR=>No. How many have you arrested? Personally.
HOOVER=>I. I've never arrested anybody.
MCKELLAR=>You never arrested anybody?
HOOVER=>I'm an administrator.
MCKELLAR=>With no field experience.
MCKELLAR=>You are shockingly unqualified, aren't you, sir? You have never personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in your life.
MCKELLAR=>I think you are a front. I think your prowess as a lawman is a myth created from a hoopla of headlines by Mr. Suydam, your publicist, there ... with crimebusters and G-men with you set up as Czar. And that is runnin' wild in my estimation ...
HOOVER=>Crime is what runs wild! Criminals, who flee in fast automobiles across state lines thereby defeating jurisdiction because there is no federal police force to stop them. And ...
MCKELLAR=>And if the country required an expanded Bureau to be more effective, I would question whether you are the person fit to run it because ...
MCCKELLAR=>And if the country required such a Bureau, I would question you are the person fit to run it ...
HOOVER=>I won't be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians ...
MCKELLAR=>Because you have allowed these outlaws to flourish unabated. Your appropriation request is denied.
HOOVER=>Does he use prostitutes? Was he soft on the Reds in 1919? Peppy stuff like that. Find out. Feed the following to Walter Winchell: "McKellar's a Neanderthal. He's on a personal vendetta to destroy me." We will not fight McKellar in his committee room. We will fight him on the front page. Where is Dillinger?
TOLSON=>Spotted in Hammond, Indiana.
HOOVER=>How long ago?
TOLSON=>Yesterday. Another sighting has him on the Lincoln Highway in Ohio heading towards Cincinnati.
SUYDAM=>How do you know?
HOOVER=>You can have fun in Chicago. What the hell's there to do in Cincinnati?
HOOVER=>Agent Purvis, congratulations.
PURVIS=>Thank you sir. May I ask why?
HOOVER=>Pretty Boy Floyd, for which you have my commendation and personal gratitude. Second, you are, as of this moment, the Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago field office. Your task will be to get John Dillinger.
SUYDAM=>They're ready for him.
HOOVER=>This is Henry Suydam. He is our expert in press relations.
HOOVER=>Are you up to this task, Mr. Purvis?
PURVIS=>Absolutely, sir.
HOOVER=>Today, with President Roosevelt's support, I am declaring the United States of America's first War on Crime.
HOOVER=>And I'd like to introduce one of our finest "G-Men," Agent Melvin Purvis. I've just made Agent Purvis head of the Chicago office.
PURVIS=>Well ... through a cornfield.
PURVIS=>We'll get him.
PURVIS=>We have two things Dillinger does not.
PURVIS=>The Bureau's techniques of fighting crlme scientifically. And the visionary leadership of our Director J. Edgar Hoover.
TOLSON=>Our own Clark Gable.
HOOVER=>Mr. Tolson, when he's done let him know if he needs anything you will get it for him. And tell him he may call me J.E.
DILLINGER=>Let's play a game, Mr. President. It's called spin the dial.
DILLINGER=>Three minutes!
PIERPONT=>You! Sit down! You too. And you! ... don't get in our way and you'll be okay.
WEYLAND=>Perhaps it's one of these ...
DILLINGER=>You can be a dead hero or a live coward. Open that goddamn vault! Now!
PIERPONT=>Company!
COP=>Move out of there!
VAN METER=>Why? I wanna watch. What?
DILLINGER=>That your money, mister?
FARMER=>Yess. It is.
DILLINGER=>Well, put it away. We're not here for your money. We're here for the bank's money.
PIERPONT=>You three, let's go.
DILLINGER=>Stay calm, folks, and stay low.
PIERPONT=>Hold on, honey.
MAKLEY=>.2 miles - turn left at the white barn. Right there. Now .. 6 miles to the new bridge.
DILLINGER=>Okay. Beat it!
DILLINGER=>Something to remember me by.
VAN METER=>Are we taking 'em to the hideout?
DILLINGER=>That depends.
VAN METER=>How 'bout it, honey? Can you cook?
ANNA PATZKE=>Uh. Sure ... After a fashion.
ANNA PATZKE=>Well, it's true!
ANNA PATZKE=>Really?
PIERPONT=>Face each other. Join hands.
WEYLAND=>We'll freeze.
DILLINGER=>You'll worm your way out of that in about ten minutes.
DILLINGER=>It's okay, doll. You're just gonna be a little late for dinner.
BAUM=>... manufactured by Shragge-Quality in St. Louis.
PURVIS=>Agents in our offices across the country are identifying every store in the United States that sold this overcoat. Then, we will cross- reference every Dillinger family member and associate in locales where that coat was sold. He was in one of those locales when it got cold. He bought a coat. Unless he was traveling through, he was being harbored. If he returns, we will be there. It is by such methods the Bureau will get John Dillinger. Next. Doris ...
PURVIS=>For those of you who haven't met her, Miss Rogers is my secretary ... Please contact the Chicago area telephone exchange supervisors. There are six. Request appointments for Carter Baum and myself.
DILLINGER=>Alvin. You hungry? Frog legs? How's the Barkers?
KARPIS=>Everyone's good. Ma does needlepoint and listens to the radio. Me, Freddie and Dock are looking to snatch a fella. St. Paul banker, Ed Bremer. We need a few more hands.
DILLINGER=>I don't like kidnapping.
KARPIS=>Yeah? Robbing banks is getting tougher.
DILLINGER=>Well, the public don't like kidnappers.
KARPIS=>Who gives a damn what the public likes?
DILLINGER=>I do. I hide out among them.
KARPIS=>I am strictly out to make cake ...
DILLINGER=>... yeah, then you, Ma and Dock go and hole up on a farm like hermits for six months. I grew up on a goddamn farm. I hate farms. Give me big cities, crowds and a good time ...
KARPIS=>We also got a mail train we been lookin' at, too.
DILLINGER=>By the way, if someone got pinched
KARPIS=>Lawyer named Piquett. Louis Piquett. We all use him.
DILLINGER=>What's it about this train? ..
KARPIS=>Needs two, three more right guys to take it down. It'll be ready to go in a couple of months. It's a six- hander.
DILLINGER=>Sounds like Jesse James.
KARPIS=>A million seven, a million eight.
KARPIS=>Federal Reserve shipment. It runs only twice a month. This is the kind of score you go away on after.
DILLINGER=>Where you going?
KARPIS=>Brazil. Cuba, maybe. What about you?
DILLINGER=>We're having too good a time today. We ain't worryin' about tomorrow ...
KARPIS=>You ought to. What we're doin', don't last forever.
DILLINGER=>Keep me in mind on the train.
VAN METER=>Why not do this snatch? The Bremer guy ... Know how much they made snatchin' that Hamm Brewery guy? $100,000. And the beer.
DILLINGER=>Quiet down, Homer.
PIERPONT=>Shut your yap ...
VAN METER=>Let's get out of here and go ...
DILLINGER=>Homer stayin' steady enough?
HAMILTON=>He's okay.
DILLINGER=>Three rules I learned from Walter Dietrich. One: never work when you're not ready. Two: never work with people who aren't the best. Three: never work with people who are desperate.
HAMILTON=>Well, I got rule four: stay away from women.
DILLINGER=>Without women, might as well have stayed in stir.
HAMILTON=>That's why they invented whores. Dillinger ignores Anna's greeting and seating and keeps his eye on Billie. Music ends. Next cue is up tempo. Young man escorts Billie to her table. He tries to join her. She turns him down.
DILLINGER=>Hi, doll. I don't know why you gave that fella the "go-by," but I sure am glad you did.
DILLINGER=>What's your name?
BILLIE=>Billie Frechette.
DILLINGER=>Buy you a drink?
DILLINGER=>Is that French?
BILLIE=>On my father's side. There's an "e"
DILLINGER=>Jack Harris.
BILLIE=>You dance, Jack?
DILLINGER=>I don't know how.
BILLIE=>C'mon, follow me. How come you don't know how to dance? Don't look at my feet. Look at my shoulders.
TORCH SINGER=>"Pack-up all my cares and Here I go, singing low Bye, bye blackbird"
BILLIE=>This is a two-step.
DILLINGER=>My, but you are pretty ...
DILLINGER=>Where you from, Billie?
BILLIE=>Flandreau.
DILLINGER=>Where's Flandreau?
TORCH SINGER=>"Where somebody waits for me Sugar's sweet, so is she Bye, bye blackbird
BILLIE=>South Dakota.
DILLINGER=>Father's French, what's on the other side?
BILLIE=>Italian.
DILLINGER=>Yeah? From South Dakota ... Indian's more likely than Italian.
BILLIE=>My momma's a Menominee Indian. Most men don't like to hear that. Okay?
DILLINGER=>I'm not most men.
BILLIE=>And I check coats at the Steuben Club. And that's not very glamorous, either. Okay? What do you do, Jack?
DILLINGER=>I'm catching up.
BILLIE=>On what?
DILLINGER=>Say, how'd you like some dinner?
BILLIE=>Sure.
TORCH SINGER=>"So make my bed and light the light Cause I'll be home late tonight Bye, bye blackbird ... "
DILLINGER=>What are you gonna have?
BILLIE=>What is it, exactly, you do for a living?
DILLINGER=>Well ... I rob banks.
DILLINGER=>That's where all these people here put their money.
BILLIE=>Why'd you tell me that? You could have made up a story ...
DILLINGER=>'Cause I can't lie to you.
BILLIE=>That's a pretty serious thing to say to a girl you just met.
DILLINGER=>I feel like I know you.
BILLIE=>Well I don't know you. I haven't been any of the places you've been. I don't even know what I don't know.
DILLINGER=>Some of the places I been ain't so hot. Where I'm going is a lot better. Wanna come along?
BILLIE=>Boy, you are in a hurry.
DILLINGER=>If you were looking at what I am looking at, honey, you'd be in a
BILLIE=>Well, it's me they're looking at this time.
DILLINGER=>That's 'cause you're beautiful.
BILLIE=>That's nice. But they're looking at me because they're not used to having a Menominee Indian girl in their restaurant in a three dollar dress.
DILLINGER=>Listen, doll, that's 'cause they're all about where people come from. Only thing important is where somebody's going.
BILLIE=>Where are you going?
DILLINGER=>To the top.
DILLINGER=>Let's get out of here.
CATENA=>Hey Johnny ... !
DILLINGER=>Go wait outside.
DILLINGER=>How you been, Gil?
CATENA=>Real good. I work for Mr. Nitti, now, ever since I got out.
DILLINGER=>Looks like a barber.
CATENA=>Don't go by looks. He's real smart. We're connected-up to everybody all over the country now ...
D'ANDREA=>Everytime I read about your bank jobs, where you give customers back their money, you crack me up ... You need anything, ask Gilbert. Gilbert knows how to find me.
DILLINGER=>See you Gilbert ...
CATENA=>Good luck, Johnny.
DILLINGER=>See where that girl went?
DOORMAN=>Nossir. Jumped in a cab and took off.
BAUM=>That noise on the line? That's called "swing". Nothing we can do about it. Worn insulation. Some words get dropped. You're listening to a phone call with a car dealer from 27 minutes ago. Harry Berman.
BERMAN=>I got a DeSoto. Bored it out. Rebuilt the car by myself.
VOICE=>Okay.
BERMAN=>Interior's no good.
VOICE=>Don't matter. It's a work car.
BERMAN=>When you want it?
VOICE=>We'll call you.
BAUM=>We think that's Dillinger's voice.
PURVIS=>How did we find Berman?
BAUM=>Off of Dillinger's coat that he left on that girl. The coat was bought in Cicero, Illinois at a store that's a few doors down from Berman's dealership. Berman we know. He's supplied cars to the syndicate since Capone. When Dillinger bought that coat he must have been at Berman's switching cars.
PURVIS=>I want men on duty around the clock. Soon as they call to drop the DeSoto, we will tail it. Right to Dillinger.
BILLIE=>May I check your coat, sir?
DILLINGER=>No, honey. You go get your coat.
MAY MINCZELES=>Sounds good to me.
DILLINGER=>You ran out on me.
BILLIE=>You left me standing alone on sidewalk.
DILLINGER=>If you're going to be my girl, you have to swear you'll never do that again.
CUSTOMER=>Brown overcoat.
BILLIE=>Hey! I'm not your girl! And I'm not going to say that.
DILLINGER=>I'm waiting.
CUSTOMER=>So am I.
DILLINGER=>"I am never going to run out on you again." Say it.
BILLIE=>No.
CUSTOMER=>My coat?
DILLINGER=>Well, I will never run out on you. And that's a promise.
CUSTOMER=>Well, I want to run out of here. So, lady, go get me my coat ... ?
DILLINGER=>Keep the tip. Get the hell out of here. You ain't getting other people's hats and coats no more either.
BILLIE=>No one's ever done that for me before.
DILLINGER=>You're with me now.
BILLIE=>I don't know anything about you.
DILLINGER=>I was raised on a farm in Mooresville, Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My daddy beat the hell out of me because he didn't know no better way to raise me. I used to do dumb things but I'm a lot smarter now. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, whiskey and you. What else do you need to know?
BILLIE=>You been living here long?
DILLINGER=>Sure. Since yesterday.
DILLINGER=>I got something for you.
DILLINGER=>What's wrong? Open up.
BILLIE=>I'm drinking in a man's apartment who wants to romance me. And not for the first time. I'm no Pollyanna. But there are things that you do, would bother a girl like me ...
DILLINGER=>I can make 500 dollars a year if I'm lucky enough to have a job, which a third of American working men do not. Or I can make ten thousand dollars in a morning. I'll take my chances on the bank. No apologies. We don't go in lookin' to hurt innocent people. But if anybody tries to get in our way that's going to be too bad. That what you want to know?
BILLIE=>I'm trying to get to know you.
DILLINGER=>You want to get to know me?
BILLIE=>... smooth
DILLINGER=>I go for the finest. As much as I can get, as fast as we can get it. Where you goin'?
DILLINGER=>What do you mean?
BILLIE=>You're all packed.
DILLINGER=>Ready to get up and go in a heartbeat ... never hesitate.
DILLINGER=>What are you trying to decide? And what's wrong with your left ear?
BILLIE=>My ex-husband ... was too handy with his fists.
DILLINGER=>Where's he now?
BILLIE=>Statesville. He got caught mugging a mailman ...
DILLINGER=>... a criminal mastermind.
BILLIE=>... my mistake. I married him. I didn't know any better ...
BILLIE=>When I was a girl, we went to live on the reservation in Flandreau 'cause
BILLIE=>my daddy died. In Flandreau nothin' ever happened. When I was 13, we went to live in Milwaukee with my Aunt Ines and my cousin Frances who had a lot of Indian friends and we went around to churches and put on plays like "Little Fireface." And nothing exciting ever happened there, either. So I haven't been anywhere or done anything except come to Chicago and try to make my way.
DILLINGER=>Well baby ... I am taking you with me and you're going to start a whole new exciting kind of life from right now.
BILLIE=>And what do you want?
DILLINGER=>To please you.
BAUM=>Rorer tailed it. Berman dropped the DeSoto at the Sherone Apartments 20 minutes ago and Rorer talked to a neighbor. Men go in and out at night carrying heavy suitcases. One looks like Dillinger ...
PURVIS=>I'm leaving right now.
PURVIS=>Where are your men?
COWLEY=>My car's on Sheridan and Montrose and Rice and Madala are in the Ford V-8 on Broadway and Wilson.
PURVIS=>Blocking vehicles? End of this street? The alley?
PURVIS=>Carter, take the corner. Keep an eye on the DeSoto. Barton, you're with me.
PURVIS=>I'm Special Agent Melvin Purvis. Are you alone?
HELEN GILLIS=>No - my fiance is here.
PURVIS=>What's your fiance's name?
HELEN GILLIS=>Leonard ... McHenry.
PURVIS=>May we come in?
HELEN GILLIS=>Sure. I'm perfectly safe ... But come on in.
LEONARD=>Something wrong?
PURVIS=>You have identification?
LEONARD=>Honey, would you get my driver's licence. It's in my coat pocket.
LEONARD=>You're that ... Melvin Purvis. I've seen your picture!
PURVIS=>What do you do for a living, Leonard?
LEONARD=>I travel in ladies shoes.
LEONARD=>Show him, honey.
PURVIS=>Do you carry around a lot of samples?
LEONARD=>Sure. Big suitcases.
PURVIS=>Enjoy the rest of your dinner, Mr. McHenry.
LEONARD=>Thanks.
PURVIS=>No one in or out I'll get the others. Stay here. You watch that door from right here.
BARTON=>Bureau of Investigation. What's your name?
CARROLL=>You wanna know my name?
PURVIS=>Go get the men from Sheridan and Wilson.
PURVIS=>Where is he?!
PURVIS=>They headed north! Who's in the Broadway and Wilson car?
RICE=>That was us. We heard gunfire. So we... ...Came here.
MADALA=>Who was it? Dillinger?
BAUM=>No.
PURVIS=>The man we let get away wasn't John Dillinger. It was Baby Face Nelson.
PIERPONT=>Excuse me, officer.
PIERPONT=>Put'ern up! PUt'ern up! This is a stick-up. And you folks sit down.
DILLINGER=>You. Get over to the vault! All of you back up! Go on! Back up!
PIERPONT=>Stay calm. Sit down folks.
HOOVER=>In Greencastle, Indiana, John Dillinger held-up a bank for $74,000 while you were failing to capture Nelson in Chicago.
PURVIS=>Sir, I take full responsibility. And I would like to make a request. I would like to request that we transfer men with "special qualifications" from Dallas ... [ADR: ... here to Chicago.]
HOOVER=>Excuse me?
PURVIS=>There are some former Texas and Oklahoma law men currently with the Bureau in Dallas ...
HOOVER=>Was I mistaken in my estimation of you? I thought you understood the vision of what I'm building, a modern
PURVIS=>Absolutely sir. However, the Bureau has used these men elsewhere.
HOOVER=>Yes. And they are not our "type."
PURVIS=>I am afraid our "type" can not get the job done... Without qualified help, I would have to resign this appointment. Otherwise, I am leading men to slaughter.
HOOVER=>Mr. Tolson will call you, Agent Purvis.
WINSTEAD=>What'd he say he looked like?
HURT=>Didn't say.
PORTER=>Gentlemen need a hand?
CAMPBELL=>Sure.
PORTER=>Hardware salesmen?
WINSTEAD=>That's right.
CAMPBELL=>I'll call.
HURT=>I'm going to the men's room.
WINSTEAD=>Work around it.
PURVIS=>Agent Winstead?
WINSTEAD=>That's right.
PURVIS=>Welcome to Chicago. We have a lot of work to do.
D'ANDREA=>Who do you want out front?
NITTI=>Put Johnny Patton out front on the other four tracks. Tell Adonis. He can have the parking concessions, and maintenance.
D'ANDREA=>Annenberg wants to sell you the remaining equity in Continental News.
NITTI=>How's he doing on the wire service?
D'ANDREA=>We're feeding 300 bookies. And he came up with this gimmick called a scratch sheet.
NITTI=>What's that?
D'ANDREA=>A betting gimmick.
NITTI=>It's hot out, right?
PHIL D'ANDREA=>Yes, Frank.
NITTI=>Ever since those pricks shot me I can't get warm. What?
D'ANDREA=>Some people from Chicago over there...
PIERPONT=>What do you say we drive out separately? I want to mark some jugs in Denver and Phoenix.
DILLINGER=>Okay. Billie and I want to the Gulf Coast on the way out West, anyway. We'll meet you in Tucson on the 25th.
VAN METER=>I heard one today. Indiana paper. "Wanted. John Dillinger. Dead or dead." I think we wore out the Midwest for awhile.
DILLINGER=>Hey, Phi1...
D'ANDREA=>C'mon to the Colonial tonight. It's our joint. Be my guest ...
DILLINGER=>We' be there. No pictures.
D'ANDREA=>No pictures. Whatever these boys want, it's on the house.
DILLINGER=>What?
BILLIE=>Thank you for taking me on this trip.
DILLINGER=>You going somewhere, doll, am I?
BILLIE=>Maybe another will catch your eye like the bimbo in the paddock. So I wanted to say "thank you" before that happened.
DILLINGER=>You lookin' to leave?
BILLIE=>No.
DILLINGER=>Don't kid a kidder.
BILLIE=>Then don't play me or a fool. We both know I end up back at the Steuben Club... one way or the other.
BILLIE=>You dump me for someone else. Or, they catch you or kill you. And I don't want to be there when that happens.
DILLINGER=>Who gave you a crystal ball?
BILLIE=>I don't need one. Ask Homer.
DILLINGER=>Homer what...?
BILLIE=>... and his damn joke..."dead or dead."
DILLINGER=>I'll put you over my knee right now. You're not going anywhere. We're too good for them. They are not tough enough, smart enough, or fast enough. I can hit any bank anytime. They got to be at every bank all the time. That's why we're on top of the world. And can't put a glove on us. I'm going nowhere. And neither are you.
DILLINGER=>You and I are here for the long haul. What do you have to say about that?
CLERK=>Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sullivan of Green Bay, Wisconsin. How was your journey, sir?
DILLINGER=>Long.
CLERK=>I can send up some sandwiches and beer, if you'd like.
DILLINGER=>That would be swell. Some friends of mine should be here already. J.C. Davies and Mr. Long?
CLERK=>Out shopping, I believe. I'll let them know you're in when they come back.
DILLINGER=>Doll, you may need some company. Like me and my pal, Johnson.
BILLIE=>Get in here. Both of you ...
EYMAN=>Put clothes on, miss.
DILLINGER=>What happened?
PIERPONT=>A fire in the hotel. Firemen found our guns. Laid for us! Sorry, John.
DILLINGER=>Where they taking you?
PIERPONT=>We're getting Shanghaied to Ohio!
DILLINGER=>Where's Billie ... ?
COP EYMAN=>Your girl has been put on a bus back to Chicago. We ain't holding her.
DILLINGER=>Well, the man who killed Pretty Boy Floyd. Floyd might have been "Pretty," 'cause he sure was not "Whiz Kid Floyd."
DILLINGER=>These Arizona deputies, here? They pulled on us right away. Did not ask Washington for permission. Made no mistakes.
DILLINGER=>That fellow Barton ... one who got killed at the Sherone Apartments.
DILLINGER=>Newspaper said you found him alive. It's the eyes, right? They look at you right before they go. Then they drift into nothing. Keep you up nights.
PURVIS=>What keeps you up, nights, Mr. Dillinger?
DILLINGER=>Coffee.
DILLINGER=>You act like a confident man, Purvis. But I don't see it. You have a few qualities. And you're probably okay from a distance and there's a group of you. But right up close, toe to toe, do or die? I am used to that. Are you?
DILLINGER=>You act like a confident man, Purvis. But I don't see it. You have a few qualities. But your group's only good from a distance when you got the guy outnumbered. But up close, toe to toe, do or die? Any way you got to? I am used to that. Are you?
PURVIS=>Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.
PURVIS=>No you will not. The only way you will leave a jail cell is when we take you out to execute you.
DILLINGER=>We will see about that. Go get yourself another line of work, Melvin.
DILLINGER=>I was joking about the "we'll see about that." I'll let you boys keep me in this jail awhile.
COP EYMAN=>We'd like that, Johnny, but don't get too comfortable. They're moving you.
DILLINGER=>Where to?
COP EYMAN=>Indiana.
DILLINGER=>Why? I have absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana.
DEPUTY=>He's here.
SHERIFF HOLLEY=>Back up over there.
SHERIFF HOLLEY=>You can take the manacles off of him now.
REPORTER=>Johnny, are you glad to see Indiana again?
DILLINGER=>I am about as glad to see Indiana as Indiana is to see me.
REPORTER=>How'd you get them in?
DILLINGER=>Right now, you're too inquistive ...
PHOTOGRAPHER=>Hey Bob ... Put your arm around Dillinger.
REPORTER=>When was the last time you were in Mooresville?
DILLINGER=>Ten years ago. I was a wild boy and foolish. I held up a grocery store which I never should have done because Mr. Morgan was a good man. And they sentenced me to 10 years in the state penitentiary for a 50 dollar theft.
DILLINGER=>In prison, I met a lot of good fellas. I helped fix up the break at Michigan City. Why not? I stick to my pals and my pals stick to me.
ANOTHER REPORTER=>How long does it take you to go through a bank?
DILLINGER=>One minute and 40 seconds flat.
HOOVER=>Why is this clown Estill fraternizing with the man he is scheduled to prosecute?!
DILLINGER=>You come highly recommended by Alvin Karpis. What can you do for me? [ALT DIAL: At the arraignment they're going to try to transfer me to the State Pen.]
PIQUETT=>What's on your mind?
DILLINGER=>The electric chair.
PIQUETT=>Your honor! Are we to have an arraignment in accord with the laws of this nation, or is the State to be permitted to incite an atmosphere of prejudice? The very air reeks with the bloody rancor of intolerant malice. The clanging of shackles brings to our minds the dungeons of the Czars, not the flag-bedecked liberty of an American courtroom. I request the court to direct that those shackles be removed forthwith!
ROBERT ESTILL=>This is a very dangerous man, your Honor.
DEPUTY HOLLEY=>And I'm responsible for the safeguarding of the prisoner.
PIQUETT=>Who are you?! Are you a lawyer? What right have you to address this court?
JUDGE MURRAY=>Alright, remove the handcuffs from the prisoner.
ROBERT ESTILL=>Your honor, we'd like to relocate the prisoner. Only Indiana State Penitentiary in Michigan City can
JUDGE MURRAY=>Sheriff Holley?
SHERIFF HOLLEY=>I concur, your honor.
PIQUETT=>Sheriff Holley, I think it's a very nice jail you have right here. What makes you think there's anything wrong with it?
SHERIFF HOLLEY=>There isn't anything wrong with my jail! It's the strongest jail in Indiana.
PIQUETT=>That's what I thought. But of course, I don't want to embarrass Mrs. Holley. I appreciate that as a woman if she's afraid of an escape ...
SHERIFF HOLLEY=>I'm not afraid of an escape. I can take care of John Dillinger or any other prisoner.
JUDGE MURRAY=>Okay, Dillinger will stay here.
PIQUETT=>Thank you, your Honor. The Defense will need four months to prepare itself.
ROBERT ESTILL=>It should take 10 days.
PIQUETT=>To go on in 10 days would be a legal lynching of this lad! There's a law against lynching!
ROBERT ESTILL=>There's a law against murder!
JUDGE MURRAY=>Calm down.
PIQUETT=>I apologize to the court. Bob and I respect each other very much.
JUDGE MURRAY=>Watch out or he, too, will be putting his arm around you.
JUDGE MURRAY=>The trial starts in one month on March 12th.
DILLINGER=>Atta boy, counselor.
DILLINGER=>Hey Cahoon ...
DILLINGER=>Come on, Sam, we're going places.
DILLINGER=>Call Bryant.
CAHOON=>Bryant!
DILLINGER=>Open it up.
DILLINGER=>Call Max.
DILLINGER=>I'll kill you if I have to and don't think I won't!
BRYANT=>Max. Open up.
DILLINGER=>I will plug the warden.
DILLINGER=>Open it.
WARDEN BAKER=>That wasn't real. Was it?
YOUNGBLOOD=>Put your hands up.
DILLINGER=>Alright, which of these here cars is the fastest, and you're going with, so don't lie.
SAAGER=>That would be the Ford in the corner. It's got the new V-8.
DILLINGER=>We're taking that.
SAAGER=>That's Sheriff Lillian Holley's personal car.
DILLINGER=>Mr. Youngblood? Are we clear?
YOUNGBLOOD=>We are.
DILLINGER=>Wow!
DILLINGER=>I'm going to write to Henry Ford. "Dear Henry Ford, Your 1934 Ford is the best damned getaway car in America. Yours truly, John Dillinger." Relax folks ...
DILLINGER=>Okay. Who knows "The Last Round-up?" "Get along little doggie, get along..."
REPORTER=>How did he act?
SAAGER=>Well ... he sang part of the way.
REPORTER=>What did he sing?
SAAGER=>You know "The Last Round-up." "Get along little doggie, get along..."
NARRATOR=>As John Dillinger escaped from the Crown Point jail ... or as folks now call it, the "Clown Point Jail" ... he appears immune to the forces of law. And commenting in his fireside address on March 5th, 1933...
FDR=>The Federal government, you know, cannot be held up to mockery in this way...
NARRATOR=>Meanwhile, in Ethiopia the Emperor Haile Selassie ...
BILLIE=>Hello.
DILLINGER=>Hey doll. It's me.
DILLINGER=>Look, I can't talk long. You okay?
BILLIE=>Yeah. I heard it on the radio. How 'bout you?
DILLINGER=>Yeah, I'm fine... I'm fine. And I'm on the road to...
BILLIE=>Don't come to Chicago, Johnny.
DILLINGER=>What's that supposed to mean? I promised I'd look after you, didn't I?
BILLIE=>Yes.
DILLINGER=>Well, then I'm going to come over there, I'm going to get you, and I'm going to take care of you like always. You know that don't you? You believe that?
BILLIE=>Yes.
BILLIE=>Baby. Don't come to Chicago.
DILLINGER=>Say it. Say it. Say that.
BILLIE=>I know you will take care of me.
DILLINGER=>Alright then. I gotta get off now. I love you. Bye.
PURVIS=>She knows we're watching and he knows we're listening. Sooner or later, she'll go to him. Or, he's going to come for her.
DILLINGER=>Hiya Sport.
SPORT=>How're ya doin' Mr. Johnny? You gotta
DILLINGER=>Where's Carole?
SPORT=>They got moved to Newport, Kentucky. Can't stay here no more, Mr. Johnny.
DILLINGER=>Says who?
ZARKOVICH=>Sport's only following orders. So am I.
ZARKOVICH=>They thought you might come here.
ZARKOVICH=>Your money is no good.
DILLINGER=>I don't get it.
ZARKOVICH=>Go talk to your pal, Gilbert.
DILLINGER=>About what?
ZARKOVICH=>Talk to Gilbert Catena.
DILLINGER=>I went to East Chicago to lay low. The welcome mat was not out. I kept hearing your name. And at Oscar's, my gear is gone.
DILLINGER=>I am going to ask you once. And I just did.
GILBERT=>Let me make a call.
GILBERT=>Gimme Phil ... He's here. Okay.
D'ANDREA=>Anybody see him come in?
GILBERT=>I don't think so.
DILLINGER=>Wanna know if we're armed? We're armed.
D'ANDREA=>Look around. What do you see?
DILLINGER=>A lot of telephones.
D'ANDREA=>You see money. Last month there were independent wire services letting bookies know who won the third race at Sportmen's Park. 300 of 'em nationwide. Now there's only one. Ours. General News. On October 20, you robbed the bank in Green Castle, Indiana. You got away with $74,802. Split 5 ways, that's $14,960.40. You thought that was a big score.
DILLINGER=>Which you pay them not to.
D'ANDREA=>Right. Unless you're around. Then they got to come through that door or any other door, no matter what. What does that tell you?
DILLINGER=>I'm popular.
D'ANDREA=>You're bad for business. What this is, is called obsolescence.
D'ANDREA=>So the Syndicate got a new policy. Guys like you? Karpis? Campbell? Verne Miller? Shotgun Ziegler? We ain't laundering your money or bonds no more.
D'ANDREA=>You ain't holing up in our whorehouses anymore. No armorers. No doctors. No nothing. You get it?
D'ANDREA=>And I am telling you this because I have to. I am a messenger. This is strictly business.
D'ANDREA=>All right. But do me a personal favor.
D'ANDREA=>My son, Mark. You're his hero.
D'ANDREA=>Good luck to you. You too, Red.
HAMILTON=>Why'd you sign that asshole's paper?
DILLINGER=>I don't know.
HOOVER=>... they call Crown Point, "Clown Point."
HOOVER=>The Bureau of Investigation cannot catch Public Enemy No. 1, but Arizona cowboys can. The President of the United States stated Dillinger is making a mockery of the system of justice in this country. That means I am allowing Dillinger to make a mockery of the system of justice in this country. It is a dark cloud.
PURVIS=>But Hamilton's family hasn't had word from Red in years...
HOOVER=>Convince them to go get "word." Create informants, Agent Purvis. Suspects are to be interrogated "vigorously." "Grilled." Take direct, expedient action. As they say in Italy these days... "take off the white gloves."
HOOVER=>Do we understand each other, Agent Purvis?
HOOVER=>What's your name, son?
HARRIS=>Harris.
HOOVER=>G-Men all over the country have picked up the gauntlet flung down by the
HOOVER=>... every one ... stopped a crime from occurring and forestalled another entry into the black book of criminal deeds. I am rewarding them with these medals today. My friend, Harris here, is the first ...
DILLINGER=>You can size up a score like nobody's business, Tommy. You're a good egg, but I don't like Nelson.
MOVIE ANNOUNCER=>Verne Miller, Pretty Boy Floyd, Eddie Green, Shotgun George Ziegler. All thought they could lead a life of crime with impunity ...
DILLINGER=>And what's he here for?
SHOUSE=>I'm willing to let bygones by bygones...
MOVIE ANNOUNCER=>... as did the imprisoned Machine Gun Kelly, Harry Pierpont and Charles Makley, convicted of murder in Lima, Ohio and sentenced to die in the electric chair ...
CARROLL=>John, we gotta all be friends or this ain't gonna work.
DILLINGER=>Red told you. After we take the bank, we bust out Pierpont and Makley.
CARROLL=>That's going to take some careful planning.
MOVIE ANNOUNCER=>... and Public Enemy Number 1, John Dillinger.
SHOUSE=>C'mon, they got the prison surrounded by National Guard ...
MOVIE ANNOUNCER=>And in a moment, please look around you, ladies and gentlemen, as we raise the lights. They may be sitting amongst you. House lights!
HAMILTON=>Oh Jesus ...
MOVIE ANNOUNCER=>They may be in your row. Turn to your right and turn to your left ... If you see them, call the Bureau of Investigation or your local police.
CARROLL=>After the bank we'll figure out if we can bust out Pierpont and Makley. You got my word. Okay?
DILLINGER=>Okay.
HAMILTON=>And I got my eye on you. You step out of line one inch and I will kill you. Then I will kill your parents for having had you.
DILLINGER=>Where's the bank?
CARROLL=>Sioux Falls. Nelson says there's $800,000 in there. He got us a great place to holeup after 'til the heat blows over.
HAMILTON=>"Don't work with people you don't know and don't work when you're desperate." Walter Dietrich. Remember that?
DILLINGER=>Walter forgot ... when you're desperate, that's when you got no choice.
BABY FACE NELSON=>I got one! I got that cop!
DILLINGER=>Where the hell's the money we came here for?!
NELSON=>What are you looking at?
DILLINGER=>Son of a bitch!
DILLINGER=>C'mon!
HAMILTON=>Right! Goddamnit! Right!
DILLINGER=>How'd you find this place?
NELSON=>Couple of Chicago guys told Tommy. Don't worry, nobody's gonna find us. He thinks we're salesmen.
DILLINGER=>How much?
BABY FACE NELSON=>$46,120.
VAN METER=>Still more than $8,000 a man.
DILLINGER=>Leave me my money and get out.
DILLINGER=>We gotta cut loose from Nelson.
HAMILTON=>You need to rest up awhile.
DILLINGER=>No. We don't get out of here first thing in the morning, we're going to wind up dead.
HAMILTON=>Only you got a chance to make it.
DILLINGER=>Don't talk like that...
HAMILTON=>Why? I'm feeling my time's up. When your time's up, it's up.
DILLINGER=>Look, Red, I need two more guns. In the morning we'll head to Reno and we'll be okay.
PURVIS=>This is our only opportunity.
CARROLL=>Gimme the shot, Doc. Please. I'm begging you.
RORER=>Not until you tell us!
CARROLL=>Oh, Mother! Help me! Please, God!
DOCTOR=>The bullet entered the back of his head. It is resting over his right eye. His brain swelling. He will be dead soon. He is suffering and I need to sedate him.
PURVIS=>Not yet. If you interfere, I'll arrest you.
RORER=>Where is he?!
CARROLL=>Give me a shot!
RORER=>Dillinger! Then you get the shot! Where is he?
PURVIS=>Little Bohemia is in Manitowish, Wisconsin.
RORER=>Nearest airport to Manitowish is Rhinelander.
PURVIS=>Rhinelander, Wisconsin.
PURVIS=>Our group will fly down in the plane to Rhinelander and get cars.
PURVIS=>Sam, you drive up.
COWLEY=>Little Bohemia. Manitowish, Wisconsin.
PURVIS=>If you can get Dillinger alive, do it. If not, put him down. Madala, you and Clegg cut through the woods. Stay in the trees. Come up on it from the south ... close enough to see if they're in the barroom there. Rice and Rorer come up on it from the north. Kitchen's there. See if they're in what's probably the dining room. Stay in the trees.
WINSTEAD=>If he's in there ... ?
PURVIS=>We go in.
WINSTEAD=>And if he isn't?
PURVIS=>We go in anyway.
WINSTEAD=>There is too much real estate out here. Too many ways for him to get out. And there's too few of us to block him in. We need blockaded roads behind us.
WINSTEAD=>We gotta wait for Cowley's group to surround'em. This ain't how to do it.
PURVIS=>We must take direct and expedient action. I will not risk their escaping the Bureau again. You and Hurt take the northeast corner where the road turns. Cover that and the front. You and Baum are with me ...
NELSON=>I'm buying you another drink. Siddown
PURVIS=>Stop that car!
BAUM=>Bureau of Investigation, Federal Agents. Nobody move!
PURVIS=>Federal Agents! Stop! Fire!
PURVIS=>Watch for'em making a run! Where the hell is Cowley?
CLEGG=>Someone got out!
PURVIS=>Dillinger?
CLEGG=>Don't know!
PURVIS=>Drive 'round the woods and flank him!
DILLINGER=>You hit, Red?
HAMILTON=>I don't think so.
DILLINGER=>Come on, Red. We can make it.
NELSON=>I know you bastards wear bulletproof vests, so I'll give it to you high and low ...
PURVIS=>Carter!
PURVIS=>Who was it? Was it Dillinger?
BAUM=>Nelson.
DILLINGER=>Gimme the keys to that car!
SURAN=>Somebody's on the road!
PURVIS=>Turn it around! ... You see a car?
COWLEY=>A Ford? It was going the other way...
PURVIS=>Nelson. He killed Carter.
NELSON=>You dumb bastards.
NELSON=>I killed one of the Feds on the road...
PURVIS=>Faster, Sam!
NELSON=>They're behind us! Let them have it.
NELSON=>Come back here, help me, you son of a bitch!
PURVIS=>Rest quiet and you will be alright, Sam.
HAMILTON=>Not like you ain't seen a man die before.
HAMILTON=>You gotta let ... You gotta let me go, John.
DILLINGER=>Bullshit.
HAMILTON=>And you gotta let go of Billie, too.
HAMILTON=>I know ... you ... you never let no one down. But this ... time ... you gotta let go ... you gotta let go.
RORER=>What's she doing?
REINECKE=>Still listening to the radio ...
PURVIS=>We have lost Agent Baum. Agent Cowley died at five-twenty this evening.
PURVIS=>And right now all of Dillinger's friends are dead. He is out there. And he is alone. There will not be a better chance to run him down.
RORER=>He could be anywhere - California, Florida ...
PURVIS=>He could be anywhere - but he is not anywhere. What he wants is right here. Billie Frechette.
WILL ROGERS=>Well, they said they were going to get Public Enemy #1. And they had John Dillinger surrounded ... They was all ready to shoot him as soon as he came out. But a bunch of folks came out ahead, so they shot all them instead.
WILL ROGERS=>But, Dillinger did aid law enforcement in one way today. He is cited as the reason Congress pushed through the first national Crime Bill making criminal enterprise across state lines a federal offense. Meanwhile, the Feds ...
NITTI=>Okie inbred cocksuckers ... backwoods sonsabitches. They did this!
D'ANDREA=>Did what?
NITTI=>Syphilitic Nelson. Karpis. Dillinger. We're building coast to coast ... We want it nice and quiet. And they bring this on us ... ?
D'ANDREA=>Frank, calm down. They rob banks.
NITTI=>Right. From state, to state. That's called interstate. And we're coast to coast. Wake up! Now they can use the laws on us.
WILL ROGERS=>... will get Dillinger someday. Probably when he's with a group of innocent bystanders they're shooting and he'll get killed by accident ...
BILLIE=>I'm fine, baby ...
BILLIE=>What time is it?
DILLINGER=>Four a.m. Sunday morning.
DILLINGER=>What's wrong?
BILLIE=>I didn't want to fall asleep.
DILLINGER=>Why?
BILLIE=>I want all the time there is. Johnny. I don't care how short or how long, I'd rather be on the run with you, than any other way.
BILLIE=>Where? Like the Bahamas?
DILLINGER=>Off this job Alvin's got, maybe we can go a lot further. They're watching ports and airports, but I can drive us into Mexico or hire a plane to Monterrey. Then a Pan Am clipper to Rio. From there, anywhere. Maybe Singapore. We're only more foreigners to them. They have no idea who we are. We can go dancing and have a lotta laughs anytime we want ...
DILLINGER=>Wanna take that ride with me?
BILLIE=>I want every moment with you I can get.
NIECE=>Can we take a picture?
DILLINGER=>You got an eye on those federal men?
NEPHEW=>Yes sir. They're over having breakfast at Myra's Diner. They've been hanging
BILLIE=>That how he was when he was a boy? Carefree and laughing ... ?
JOHN SR.=>After a while, yes.
JOHN SR.=>He grew up a motherless child ... After she was buried when he was three, he never knew a woman's comfort. I loved him but didn't know how to raise him. And that's the truth. When he came out of that prison, he had so many worries. Restless. Bitter. And a desire to get even.
JOHN SR.=>Well, now he has gotten even. And he has you. So, I am not surprised he is carefree. What will you and Johnny do?
BILLIE=>Try to live somewhere else.
JOHN SR.=>Whatever happens, he my boy. And I have loved him in my heart, always. Right or wrong, no matter what.
BILLIE=>Where's the apartment?
DILLINGER=>Oakley and Potomac. Bartender's name is Larry Streng. He'll give you the keys.
DILLINGER=>5,000 dollars. It buys us a month, but we're not staying that long.
REINECKE=>Who brought you? How'd you get here?
BILLIE=>... I took a taxi.
MADALA=>Where is he? Where were you meeting? Where were you hiding out?
REINECKE=>... or we drop you in a black hole with the shit and the rats.
REINECKE=>Where is he?!
BILLIE=>I have to ...
REINECKE=>Lady, you're stinking up my office. Where were you supposed to meet him!
REINECKE=>I can't hear you.
BILLIE=>We were supposed to meet at our apartment ...
REINECKE=>Where?
BILLIE=>On Addison. 1148 ...
REINECKE=>When?
BILLIE=>Now.
REINECKE=>Where is he!
BILLIE=>Well ... ... he's way the hell away from here by now, isn't he?
BILLIE=>You wanted to know where he is, you dumb flatfoot? You walked right past him on State Street. You were too scared to look around. He was at the curb in that black Hudson. You asked me "how I got there?" I told you I took a taxi. And you believed that? He dropped me off and was waiting for me. And you walked right past him.
DORIS=>Mr. Purvis, you have to stop this. Those men cannot abuse a woman that way.
BILLIE=>... and when my Johnny finds out how you slapped around his girl. You know what happens to you, fatboy?
PURVIS=>Uncuff her.
PURVIS=>Restroom's down the hall.
BILLIE=>I can't stand up.
PURVIS=>Miss Rogers...
DILLINGER=>$5,000. You run her down. Lake County jail or Cook County? I want layouts, blueprints. You visit her. Tell her I'm coming for her. I'll get her out.
DILLINGER=>What happened to you?
PROBASCO=>I walked into a door.
DILLINGER=>I'm fine. I got a place.
ZARKOVICH=>What did they say? Seagram and ginger ale.
ANNA SAGE=>Send me back to Romania.
ZARKOVICH=>You know what to do.
ZARKOVICH=>Plus there's a $25,000 reward.
ANNA SAGE=>We split.
ZARKOVICH=>O'Neill's got to be cut in, too. So it splits three ways.
ANNA SAGE=>They fix the deportation? Can they do that with Immigration?
ZARKOVICH=>These guys can fix anything.
ANNA SAGE=>I want guarantee.
PURVIS=>If you aid us apprehending John Dillinger, I will do everything I can to influence Bureau of Immigration to let you stay in America.
ANNA SAGE=>No good.
PURVIS=>That's all there is.
ANNA SAGE=>I think you did this. I think you tell Immigration to pick me up and to send me back to Romania.
PURVIS=>How do you socialize with him?
ANNA SAGE=>We go out, maybe tomorrow night. Maybe not. Maybe in a week. A month. Maybe never.
PURVIS=>I will not guarantee what Immigration will do. What I can guarantee is what I will do. If you do not cooperate, you will be on a boat out of this country in 48 hours. Do not play games with me.
PURVIS=>Who's "we"?
ANNA SAGE=>Me. Him. Polly Hamilton, one of my girls.
PURVIS=>How will we know?
ANNA SAGE=>I call you Sunday when I know.
ZARKOVICH=>Mr. Nitti. I'm Marty Zarkovich. I was told to call you. She gonna play ball.
NITTI=>Be there. Make sure.
ZARKOVICH=>Uh, the Feds are plenty serious all on their own.
NITTI=>They make speeches. Then they screw it up. You get your ass there and you make sure.
ZARKOVICH=>Yes sir.
KARPIS=>On Tuesday it will carry the payroll for seven factories around Rockford. Two ways in. Route 14 and 11. Two ways out. Harry handles the door and the safe ...
KARPIS=>Dock cuts the telephone five minutes before .... train arrives, you and Harry and I go in strong. Dock comes down the telephone pole by then and becomes the Lookout Man. Jimmie and Freddie drive.
DILLINGER=>What do you figure?
KARPIS=>$1.5 to $1.7 million. About $300,000 each. Karpis is quiet. They are both feeling the ghosts of their friends ...
KARPIS=>Sorry about Red.
DILLINGER=>Thanks.
KARPIS=>I liked Nelson for some reason.
DILLINGER=>You were in a minority.
KARPIS=>We had a talk once, at Czernaky's...
DILLINGER=>Yeah?
KARPIS=>Well I reminded him ...
DILLINGER=>You get into Milan Penitentiary? You see Billie?
PIQUETT=>Yes, I did. She asked me to give this to you.
BILLIE=>Don't try and break me out. I am too well guarded. Two years is not a long time, anyway. Go away someplace where you're safe like Mexico and wait for me. We will be together again. Your true love in life, Billie.
PIQUETT=>She told me what was in it. It's good advice.
KARPIS=>So like I said, I reminded him ...
DILLINGER=>Reminded who?
KARPIS=>Nelson, that he told me if he ever got $20,000 together, he'd up and quit forever ... Then, after he hit the Janesville bank I said, "Yeah, so...?"
DILLINGER=>Well, I can. We do this Tuesday, I'm gone on Wednesday.
KARPIS=>I been thinking Varadero Beach, outside Havana. You ever been there?
DILLINGER=>No. If I go, it better be a lot further than Cuba.
ANNA SAGE=>Hi Jimmy. Polly, Jimmy's back ...
DILLINGER=>Tell you what, doll. You and Polly and me, we'll go out to a movie tonight and get in the re-frigeration.
ANNA SAGE=>Where you want to go? Jimmy take us to picture show.
DILLINGER=>Maybe the Marbro or the Biograph ...
ANNA SAGE=>I go to store later and make fried chicken tonight.
DILLINGER=>Where you goin'?
POLLY=>Streetcar. I gotta go downtown to get my waitressing license.
DILLINGER=>I'll take you. It's too hot in here.
ANNA SAGE=>We go tonight. I don't know which theater. Marbro or Biograph. I won't know 'til last minute.
PURVIS=>Miss Sage ...
PURVIS=>It is tonight, Marbro. Or the Biograph...
POLLY=>Be right back ...
DILLINGER=>I'll go in with you.
DILLINGER=>How long?
POLLY=>It might take ten minutes.
DILLINGER=>I'll meet you outside ...
DILLINGER=>You pass?
POLLY=>I got to go back. They needed a blood test.
ZARKOVICH=>That's how we'll know it's him. He may have changed his appearance. And we do not learn whether he will go to the Marbro or the Biograph.
RORER=>Two theaters?
PURVIS=>That's right. It's undecided to which he's taking them.
WINSTEAD=>What's playin'?
PURVIS=>Excuse me?
WINSTEAD=>What's playin' at the Marbro? What's playin' at the Biograph?
MADALA=>... a Shirley Temple movie called "Little Miss Marker" is at the Marbro. Biograph is playing a gangster picture starring Clark Gable. "Manhattan Melodrama."
WINSTEAD=>John Dillinger ain't going to a Shirley Temple movie.
PURVIS=>Sergeant Zarkovich and Agent Winstead will be at the Biograph. As will I and Special Agent Madala. Virgil Peterson will coordinate the Marbro. The rest of you will wait here until the theater is confirmed. Since we do not know with certainty which theater, we will have to take
PURVIS=>He will be armed and extremely dangerous. Try to take him alive if possible. If not, do what you need to protect yourself. You will be armed with handguns only to insure innocent bystanders are not hit.
BROWN=>Nothing yet.
TICKETSELLER LADY=>The movie runs an hour and 34 minutes and it started about 3 minutes ago so that means it will all be over in an hour, 30...
AGENT RORER=>They're on their way over here from the Marbro.
SECRETARY=>Remember what happened to that District Attorney in the Midwest. Just for having his picture taken with some gangster...?
CLARK GABLE=>But Blackie's my friend.
PURVIS=>Zarkovich, you, O'Neill and your men are at that hat store. Suran, Clegg
PURVIS=>and McCarthy take two agents into the rear alley. Rorer, you and Reinecke stay there in the car. I will be outside the theater. I will light a cigar when he comes out.
WINSTEAD=>Clarence and I are going to be in that doorway. 30 feet south of the theater entrance. Gerry, you be in that tan car.
PURVIS=>In case he walks north?
WINSTEAD=>He's gonna walk south and cut through that alley back to her place. Gerry, when you spot him through your rearview ... you come up on him from behind.
JANITOR=>They're comin' to stick us up again.
CHARLIE=>Where?
JANITOR=>In the alley ...
CHARLIE=>Irene. Anything strange?
IRENE=>There's a sweaty man that keeps asking when the movie's gonna end ... Across the street, there's three, four men and there's two more around the corner ... why are they wearing suitcoats on such a hot night?
CHARLIE=>Pretend like nothing's going on ...
DESK SERGEANT'S VOICE=>District 37, Sheffield Avenue ...
CHARLIE=>Get some detectives over here, this is Charlie Shapiro at the Biograph. They're gonna stick us up again ...
DESK SERGEANT'S VOICE=>How do you know, Charlie?
CHARLIE=>I see them getting in position, like they're waiting 'til the movie's over ...
CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE=>Hands up.
SURAN=>Wait ... ! Hold it! Federal Agent! Department of Justice. Bureau of Investigation!
CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE=>What do you think you're doing here?
SURAN=>I'm on a Federal stakeout! And back those cars out of the alley. But stay close because we may need you.
CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE=>"You may need us?" Fuck you, college boy. Let's see your goddamn badge!
MYRNA LOY=>I love you more than anything, Blackie, you know...
PURVIS=>I am Special Agent in Charge Melvin Purvis of the Bureau of Investigation. You cannot interfere with our operation here.
CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE=>And I won't 'cause you're okay, Mr. Purvis. But his East Chicago, Indiana badge don't count. They wait until my Captain shows.
PRISONER=>So long, Blackie.
CLARK GABLE=>Die the way you lived. All of a sudden.
CLARK GABLE=>Living like that doesn't mean a thing.
CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE=>Where you think you're going?
WINSTEAD=>That's Dillinger. Straw hat. Glasses.
PURVIS=>Halt!
DILLINGER=>...tell Billie...
PURVIS=>What did he say?
WINSTEAD=>I couldn't hear him.
PURVIS=>You look after this. I need to call Washington. Cover his face. Keep the damn photographers away.
ALVIN KARPIS=>I am unarmed.
WINSTEAD=>Don't even breathe sudden.
HURT=>Put your hands on the roof of that Lincoln.
WINSTEAD=>Where you from?
ALVIN KARPIS=>Mostly Chicago. You?
WINSTEAD=>Fort Worth. Clarence is from Tyler.
WINSTEAD=>Alvin. You sly dog. If you'd a even had that jacket on ...
SPECIAL AGENT=>There's no handcuffs.
WINSTEAD=>Give me your tie.
HURT=>Put that down.
TOLSON=>"You are under ... "
HOOVER=>You are under arrest for the ... Wahpeton, South Dakota bank robbery.
HOOVER=>I heard of your fishing prowess. I myself, always wanted to catch a marlin ...
ALVIN KARPIS=>You're thinking of my partner, Harry Campbell.
HOOVER=>Are you relieved it's over? I'm sure you are. You know you will feel much better once you get everything off your chest. Why don't you tell me where Harry Campbell is?
ALVIN KARPIS=>Who do you think you're talking to?
NEWSMEN=>Mr. Hoover! Director!
HOOVER=>Karpis said he'd never be taken alive, but I took him without firing a shot. That marks him as a yellow rat. He was scared to death when I arrested him. That's all I got to say.
SUYDAM=>Mr. Hoover personally placed Alvin Karpis under arrest today. Karpis
SUYDAM=>reached for a rifle, but the Director was too fast.
TOLSON=>The Director will see you now.
HOOVER=>Agent Purvis.
PURVIS=>Yes sir. I came to ...
HOOVER=>A medical student in the morgue made that cast of Dillinger's face. Where are you now? In the fingerprinting section, correct? It's a reminder of the war we wage against the punks and hoodlums.
PURVIS=>Sir, John Dillinger was an Outlaw and he was my Adversary. But he was no punk. And he was no hoodlum. I came here to say that I have no future in your Bureau. And I do not desire one. I quit.
WINSTEAD=>How are you doing, Billie? I'm Special Agent Winstead.
BILLIE=>If you come here to ask me more damned questions. "Where's this one or that one? Did I know Vern Miller? Who did what ... ?"
WINSTEAD=>I didn't come here for you to tell me something. I carne here to tell you something.
BILLIE=>Okay, Mr. Winstead. What do you got to tell me?
BILLIE=>They say you're the man who shot him?
BILLIE=>So why are you coming here to see me? To see the damage you done?
WINSTEAD=>Because he asked me to.
WINSTEAD=>When he went down, he said something. And I put my ear next to his mouth and what I think he said was this. He said ... " ... tell Billie for me ... Bye Bye Blackbird ... "
