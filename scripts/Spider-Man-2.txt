PETER=>Look at this guy.
PETER=>You probably think it'd be cool to trade places with this guy. Styling costume. Awesome powers. Greatest damn city in the world.
PETER=>Is that what you're thinking?
PETER=>Maybe you'd better wait until you see the kind of day this guy's having.
JJJ=>Parker, you're fired!
JJJ=>Dogs catching Frisbees in the park... Some fat old geezer playing chess... Autumn leaves.
PETER=>I was thinking maybe the Bugle could show another side of New York for a change–-
JJJ=>Parker, if I believed for one second those pictures were an accurate reflection of this town, I'd hang myself from the top of the Chrysler Building. I don't pay you to be a sensitive artist! I pay you because for some reason that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
PETER=>Well, it's like I told you, Mr. Jameson. Spider-Man won't let me take any more pictures of him. He says you only use them to slander him. You've turned the
JJJ=>A fact I'm very proud of! Having that lunatic around has weakened the moral fiber of New York! The police are demoralized! The citizens lazy! Now get your pretty little "portfolio" out of my face before I go into a diabetic coma!
PETER=>Mr. Jameson, please. You can't fire me. Even working two jobs I can barely make tuition, and Aunt May's social security doesn't amount to...
JJJ=>It stinks. I'll give you three hundred.
PETER=>No. There's no way I can sell you this shot… until you agree to run more balanced coverage of Spider-man.
JJJ=>I take my journalistic responsibility to present balanced coverage very seriously Parker, you know that. Fine. I'll give you four. I'll nominate him for a goddamn medal, Parker. You have my word.
PETER=>Five.
JJJ=>That's outrageous. Done.
PETER=>Time. Right.
PETER=>Sorry! Mr. Aziz, I'm sorry.
MR. AZIZ=>Twenty-one minutes ago, in comes an order from the high-quality law firm of Foehn, Harmattan & Buran for seventeen extra large deep-dish pizzas. In eight minutes, I am defaulting on the Mineo's twenty-nine minute guarantee.
PETER=>Why didn't you send Salim?
MR. AZIZ=>Salim was deported yesterday. I have no hope but you. You must make it in time.
PETER=>I don't believe this!
PETER=>Pizza time!
PETER=>Mr. Aziz! I'm back! I--
MR. AZIZ=>You are fired, that is what you are. The pizzas arrived three minutes late! Peter, the twenty-nine minute guarantee is a promise. I know a promise means nothing to you, but to me it is serious.
PETER=>It's serious to me, too, Mr. Aziz.
GOON=>Christ, I think you broke my tailbone!
PETER=>Oh, man, I'm sorry, I--
PETER=>My ID? Since when--?
HARRY=>What the hell you did to my security guy?
PETER=>He surprised me! I grabbed him and he... he must have lost his footing. I think they just waxed the lobby. What's with the muscleman, Harry? Did somebody threaten you?
PETER=>Harry. I'm worried about you. You've really gotten kind of...
HARRY=>I guess you're who you seem to be.
PETER=>Please just tell me you didn't put a camera in the bathroom.
HARRY=>You could save me a buttload of money and trouble if you would just tell me how you always manage to find the guy.
PETER=>I would if I could. I swear to you.
HARRY=>That's fine. No, I'm serious. You don't need me, I don't need you. We're not even really friends, are we?
PETER=>Octavius! Otto Octavius is the god of arachnid biomimetics. Harry, I know
HARRY=>Lord have mercy on my soul.
PETER=>You promised you'd introduce me to him!
HARRY=>And you promised to help me get Spider Man! All right, fine. I keep my promises.
PETER=>Great! Okay! Let's bolt.
HARRY=>Oh, there was a message. For you. I didn't feel like picking up.
MJ'S VOICE=>Hello. This is Mary Jane Watson, star of the Broadway stage. You guys, I'm so nervous!
PETER=>Hmm. Geez, I hope the lecture's over by 7:30. I need to get down to the theater by 8.
HARRY=>Didn't you already see that lame show of
PETER=>Twice.
HARRY=>Christ, Pete, I know you're her boyfriend, and all, but that's above and beyond.
PETER=>Hey, tonight she's playing the lead! She's the, you know, the understudy.
HARRY=>What, did she poison the leading lady?
PETER=>Shut up. And I'm not her boyfriend.
CZERNOWITZ=>...as a doctoral candidate he was dazzling. Now I'm afraid he's left us mere mortals far behind. It's my great honor to present, director of the Anansi Project, winner of a National Science Medal, Dr. Otto Octavius.
OTTO=>Frank.
OTTO=>He told you I was "dazzling," but what he's too nice to bring up is was what an insufferable little wretch I was.
HARRY=>I will never understand this spider thing of yours.
OTTO=>We had some success with manipulating spider RNA. But it's in the area of octopedal locomotion that things are really getting exciting. The goal is to provide stable motion on every possible kind of terrain and superior manipulation
PETER=>You have to introduce me to him!
HARRY=>Don't you have a diva waiting?
PETER=>I can make it.
PETER=>I'll meet you in the lobby.
HARRY=>Where are you--
PETER=>Too much coffee.
ASSISTANT=>Look at his eyes!
TEAM LEADER=>That's the symbiosis routines in the Rig. It's actually trying to reconfigure his optical functions.
OTTO=>Was I... was I fighting Spider-Man?
TEAM LEADER=>Otto, it was too long. You stayed in the Rig too long.
HARRY=>Doesn't it hurt to be jacked into that thing?
OTTO=>Actually, thanks to the endorphin boosters it feels very good. Coming out's a bitch.
PETER=>It's so great to meet you. And the Rig's pretty--cool.
OTTO=>Still one or two--
PETER=>Actually, Doctor, I was hoping to hear you talk about the superspider research.
OTTO=>Ah. Well. Unfortunately we lost our funding for that project. I'm afraid it was rather poorly managed. And please... call me Otto. Any friend of the Osborns is my friend. The Rig's materials and kinetechnology is all Oscorp design and build. Norman Osborn was a huge supporter of my work. A steady and generous supporter. Not too mention a true original. A man, in a world of mediocrities. He's very sorely missed.
PETER=>It's sort of a hobby.
OTTO=>And you guys had a--field trip? To our lab last year? I hope that was interesting?
PETER=>Oh, yeah. Changed my life.
HARRY=>Pete? Not that I really care, but don't you have an ego extravaganza to get to?
PETER=>Jeez! Oh, my God. I have to go. Now!
OTTO=>Ego extravaganza?
PETER=>It's our friend--
HARRY=>Your friend.
PETER=>--MJ. Mary Jane Watson. She's in this musical. She's the understudy and she's making her big debut in fifteen minutes.
ROSE=>What's this?
ROSE=>Wouldn't you know it. Sixty dollars a ticket and we get the understudy.
SOPHIE=>Deirdre's probably in rehab again.
RENARD=>Just remember, acting is reacting.
MJ=>Got it.
ACTOR=>The ticket is still there.
RENARD=>Hey, cheer up. There's a TV crew here, you know. From New York 1. They heard about your big debut.
MJ=>How did they hear?
RENARD=>I don't know. Somebody must have called
MJ=>A friend of mine.
ACTOR=>Boyfriend?
MJ=>No. Just a friend. I thought he might want to see my debut, but I guess he doesn't.
ACTOR=>Eh, who needs him?
STAGE MANAGER=>MJ? You ready?
USHER=>Whoa. You can't go in there. Nobody seated once the performance begins.
PETER=>But I--
PETER=>I understand. But I have to get in there. Mary Jane Watson is a friend of mine.
USHER=>And as far as I can tell, she is a very nice young lady. Nobody seated once the performance begins. You can go in at intermission.
PETER=>When's that?
USHER=>About forty-two minutes from now.
ROSE=>She's terrible.
PETER=>It's not your problem, Pete. It's the police's problem. It's not your problem.
SPIDER-MAN=>Duly noted.
MOTHER=>Maniac! Idiot!
TAUNTING MAN=>Hey, look. It's the ten million dollar man.
KID=>You in for it now.
SPIDER-MAN=>Ten million dollars. I should arrest myself.
PETER=>Tell me I didn't miss intermission.
PETER=>MJ!
MJ=>You know, when you said you wanted to be friends, I believed you.
PETER=>I do want to be friends.
MJ=>Well, then you aren't a very good friend, are you?
MJ=>But you missed everything! All of it! Why didn't you come in at intermission?
PETER=>Well--there was an accident--in the street. I went to get a picture and--
PETER=>MJ. You aren't-- are you...
MJ=>Renard's just a friend. Why. Do you wish I was seeing somebody? Would you like to get rid of me and for all?
PETER=>MJ--
MJ=>No. No, I think you enjoy this idea you have that I'm going around carrying a torch for you. Which I'm not.
PETER=>MJ. You don't know. You don't know how much I think about you. How much I--
MJ=>No, that's right. I don't know anything. I've known you since the first grade but I don't know anything about you.
PETER=>Sorry. It's--oh. It's Aunt May. She hardly ever pages me. I better--
PETER=>Aunt May? Aunt May, what's the matter? Why are you crying?
MAY=>What's the matter? I'm going out of my mind, that's what the matter! I can't take it any more!
PETER=>Okay, okay, Aunt May, settle down. I'm coming.
PETER=>Aunt May? What--
MAY=>There's a fly.
PETER=>A fly?
MAY=>A fly, a bee, I don't know what it is. Buzzing all around the house, it's driving me insane! Who can sleep with a racket like that?
PETER=>All right. I'll take care of it.
PETER=>It's in the bedroom on your lamp.
PETER=>Mission accomplished.
MAY=>I'm sorry, Peter. I know you must think I'm losing my mind. It's just-- your uncle always killed the bugs around here.
PETER=>He was a handy guy to have around. I never realized how much I depended on his advice.
MAY=>Something on your mind?
PETER=>Well--
MAY=>You could talk to me, you know.
PETER=>Yeah, I know that. But I--
MAY=>Peter... I've seen the change that has come over you since Ben died. Everyone has.
PETER=>Change...? I don't... What do you mean?
MAY=>You have to grieve him, Peter. You have to let yourself mourn.
PETER=>Oh. Yeah. I wish I could.
MAY=>What?
PETER=>Oh--no, I mean, I know, you're right.
MAY=>Sooner or later, Peter, you have to let it out. It might as well be now.
PETER=>I'm having a very hard day, Aunt May.
MAY=>Go ahead. Cry.
PETER=>No, Aunt May. I can't cry. I can't mourn Uncle Ben. I don't have the right.
MAY=>Don't be silly, Peter. Of all people--
PETER=>Of all people, not me. You don't know- everything there is to know, Aunt May. About how Uncle Ben died. The guy who-- that punk. I had a chance to stop him.
MAY=>What?
MAY=>Well, I guess I can understand how you didn't want to tell me this.
PETER=>Aunt May?
MAY=>Damn it!
PETER=>Aunt May--
FELLOW MOTORIST=>Yo, butthead, your motorcycle is on fire.
PETER=>Stupid frigging piece of junk! Why can't I have one thing in my life that actually works!
PETER=>Harry, god damn it, let me in!
HARRY=>I made martinis.
PETER=>I see that.
HARRY=>Have a drink. You look like you could use one.
PETER=>I probably could. But no, thanks.
HARRY=>Dinner. Courtesy of Dr. Chomsky.
HARRY=>She. No, you're right. She'd probably be very disappointed in me.
PETER=>I can't. He broke off contact with me. He said I've made it too dangerous for him. He almost got killed today.
HARRY=>I know. Who do you think put up the bounty?
PETER=>Bounty!
HARRY=>I'm sorry, did I say bounty? I meant reward.
PETER=>Harry, what you're talking about is--
HARRY=>Murder? Maybe. People get murdered, Pete. My father. Your uncle. It
PETER=>I think--it would probably be best for me to move out.
HARRY=>What? Because of what I said about Spider-Man? Pete, don't be--
PETER=>Mr. Aziz fired me today, Harry. And I can't work for the Bugle anymore. So. I can't afford to pay you rent anymore.
HARRY=>You'll find another job. I'll carry you until you do, no problem.
HARRY=>No, that's right. You wouldn't want to be a sniveling little do-nothing freeloader. Like me.
PETER=>Harry, come on. Let's not--ah, forget it.
HARRY=>Pete?
PETER=>No, I don't think I'm so welcome there anymore.
BOY TALKING HEAD=>...potential applications, Octavius said, range from handling nuclear waste to
GIRL TALKING HEAD=>Speaking of creepy crawlies, Jim, it seems that Spider-Man is finding New York to be a very tough town.
SPIDER-MAN=>You shot someone for nineteen dollars? That's--
YOUNG MAN=>You're under arrest.
GROCER=>What's the matter with you? He's a good guy. I'm sorry, Spider-Man. Here.
SPIDER-MAN=>Thanks.
OLD LADY=>Ten million dollars!
SPIDER-MAN=>Got a minute?
JJJ=>This is Jameson. Code S. Repeat. Code S.
SPIDER-MAN=>Is that S as in "shut the hell up"?
JJJ=>I-- I'm acrophobic. Fear of heights.
SPIDER-MAN=>Really, I thought that was fear of spiders. Look, Jameson. I'm fine with you hating me. I'm even fine with you slandering me. But getting me killed, I don't know, that kind of irritates me a little.
JJJ=>The Bugle didn't tell anybody to kill you.
HARRY=>So, that's it. You're just going.
PETER=>I found a place out in Sheepshead Bay.
HARRY=>You don't have to take dirty clothes. You can still do your wash here, you know.
PETER=>I need the big machine.
YOUNG MAN=>Okay, mister. Take it easy.
DR. CHOMSKY=>Nightmares?
HARRY=>Every night. Two of them, last night.
DR. CHOMSKY=>What are they about?
HARRY=>I didn't think you guys handled dreams anymore. I thought that dreams were just brain garbage.
DR. CHOMSKY=>They are. But you can learn a lot about a person by going through their garbage.
HARRY=>They're disgusting. I don't want to talk about them. Just, please. Give me something to help me sleep through them.
MJ=>I sucked!
RENARD=>You sucked not.
MJ=>The Bugle was right. I do "manage to be both overstated and paper-thin at the same time."
RENARD=>Someone doesn't agree with you or the Bugle.
MJ=>If Peter thinks he can…
THE CARD=>It reads: I THINK YOU ARE BRILLIANT.
MJ=>"O.O.?"
RENARD=>Oh oh.
OTTO=>Miss Watson?
MJ=>Oh oh.
OTTO=>I hope that wasn't out of line. Was it? It was. Excuse me. I'm sorry.
MJ=>No! I mean--
OTTO=>I won't bother you again.
MJ=>Wait!
OTTO=>Peter Parker?
MJ=>Yeah…? How do you…?
OTTO=>Peter's a friend. Of a friend. Honestly, I don't really know him very well at all. But he's the one who told me about you. About your being in this show. Which I loved. It was beautiful. You were brilliant, I meant it.
MJ=>Thank you. Unfortunately the drama critic of the Daily Bugle doesn't agree with you.
MJ=>Really?
OTTO=>Legendary.
MJ=>Thanks for these.
OTTO=>Do you believe in the value of boldness, Miss Watson?
OTTO=>Have dinner with me. Right now.
MJ=>Where did you have in mind?
OTTO=>There's this Ethiopian place on West 47th.
MJ=>Ethiopian. Wow. I've never--
OTTO=>I like to eat with my hands.
OTTO=>Yum. Look at that.
MJ=>It's very… colorful.
OTTO=>Well?
MJ=>Strange but good.
OTTO=>You were telling me about your mother.
MJ=>I know I was, and I'm sorry. Let's talk about you. You seem like a much more interesting person than me.
OTTO=>Not to me. Not right now, anyway.
OTTO=>And did you have a dog?
MJ=>When I was little. Tasha. She--no. I am
OTTO=>I could describe it to you. But you would never believe it.
MJ=>Try me.
OTTO=>I'll tell you what. Come uptown. Right now. I'll show you the lab. I'll show you the rig.
MJ=>Oh, I couldn't--
OTTO=>Boldness in all things.
MJ=>Is that it?
OTTO=>That's it.
MJ=>It's beautiful. It's a little freaky.
OTTO=>Well, I'm a little freaky. You should probably know that about me.
MJ=>Okay.
OTTO=>I am not like other people, MJ. I'm not like anybody you've ever met. Freaky, yeah, I'm a freak of nature. I taught myself calculus when I was nine. I was a chess grandmaster at fifteen. I don't
MJ=>I knew a kid like that.
OTTO=>But there was always that one pretty girl who also managed somehow to be nice. I'll bet that was you, huh?
MJ=>What does it, well… do?
OTTO=>Oh, it cuts hair.
MJ=>You mean it makes you stronger?
OTTO=>Stronger, faster, yes, but also smarter. Much smarter. When I'm jacked in, I feel
MJ=>I thought so. One time.
OTTO=>There are four shunts that interface directly with my central nervous system. I wear it. But it's also wearing me.
MJ=>Does it hurt?
OTTO=>The system delivers a steady dose of pain blocking endorphins the whole time I'm in it. Which so far has never been longer than a few hours. The goal is a permanent interface. Of course the idea of a permanent human/machine integration makes some people uneasy.
MJ=>So you have, like... holes? In your back? Permanent ones?
OTTO=>Want to see them?
MJ=>Not really, but yes.
OTTO=>It's late.
MJ=>It is.
MJ=>Thank you. I had a really nice, really interesting time. And thank you for the flowers.
OTTO=>So, maybe it's out of line. For me to ask you this. But I don't want to make a
MJ=>No. I was. But he wouldn't… He couldn't... He just couldn't.
OTTO=>It's really none of my business.
OTTO=>Who's there?
PETER=>Hi.
OTTO=>What the hell are you doing here?
PETER=>I wanted to talk to you. But I see you're--what are you doing?
OTTO=>I was just--uh. Celebrating.
PETER=>You use that thing... recreationally?
OTTO=>It helps me relax.
OTTO=>The viral delivery system we were using in the superspider project.
PETER=>That's right.
PETER=>What other reason would there be?
OTTO=>Here. Yes, we were using a modified arbovirus. Highly infectious in spiders. We replaced the nucleonic RNA with whatever we wanted to code for and the virus did the rest.
PETER=>Is this arbovirus infectious in humans?
OTTO=>It could be. If we had wanted to introduce spider material into a human, I suppose we could just have just gotten one of the little critters to bite--
PETER=>What?
OTTO=>Why do you want to know?
PETER=>I'm just curious.
OTTO=>Spider-Man's a friend of yours, isn't he?
PETER=>No, not a friend--
OTTO=>Know anything about him?
PETER=>Not much. Kind of a quiet guy.
OTTO=>Know if he was ever bitten by a spider?
PETER=>He might have been. I wouldn't know.
OTTO=>We lost a spider. If, by chance, it bit him. Is that what happened? And transferred the viral genotrope in its venom...
PETER=>Not to him, it isn't. He's sick of it. That's why I came to see you. To see if there's any way to--
OTTO=>Why didn't he just come himself?
PETER=>Huh? Oh, because. He's, uh, horribly disfigured. Up close. That's why he wears the mask. It's like, he has these little hairs all over him, and compound eyeballs. And the smell!
PETER=>What is it?
OTTO=>It's basically an immune system on a chip. You seed it with a sample of the material you want to defend against, and it pumps out antigens. I call it a parity chip.
PETER=>Parity?
OTTO=>Equilibrium. The Rig is so powerfully integrative that right now it overwhelms my own systems. I'm hoping to use this to boost my body's immunity. In theory your friend could seed this with some of his own spiderized DNA, implant it, and knock out the genes that are coding for his spider traits.
OTTO=>I had dinner with Mary Jane Watson tonight.
PETER=>Oh. Yeah. I know.
OTTO=>Terrific girl.
PETER=>Agreed.
CLERK=>Can I help you?
PETER=>Yes, hello. I need some soft tissue xx. And a Y-gauge syringe.
CLERK=>A Y-gauge... what are you trying to treat, a rhinoceros?
PETER=>A spider. Really big spider.
DITKOVICH=>The new roommate.
DITKOVICH=>Mr. Parker? Everything is all right?
PETER=>Yes! Everything's fine! Sorry!
PETER=>You don't know what it's like, Uncle Ben. You don't know how it feel to be such a freak of nature! Okay, with great power comes great responsibility. I get that. But you know what comes with no power? No worries. No guilt. No freak show!
DITKOVICH=>Hit me.
PETER=>Ouch!
MAN=>Hi.
YOUNG WOMAN=>Hello.
MAN=>I'm Jack. I said, Hi. I'm Jack.
SECOND MAN=>You don't got to be rude, bitch.
JJJ=>I hope you don't have the head of an extraterrestrial in there.
HOMELESS MAN=>No, sir.
JJJ=>Because if you do, you're the third guy this week.
HOMELESS MAN=>This guy left it in the garbage. Out in New Lots. First he tried to set it on fire.
JJJ=>Set it on fire?
HOMELESS MAN=>Uh, mister...
JJJ=>Wait a minute. What kind of idiot does he think I am? A burnt costume! How heavy-handed can you get? Sure, he wants everybody to think he's quit. When, in reality, he's just going underground. Inventing a whole new identity for himself!
HOMELESS MAN=>Mr. Jameson, please, I'm hungry.
JJJ=>I'll give you fifty bucks.
HOMELESS MAN=>A hundred.
JJJ=>Seventy-five.
JJJ=>Spider-Man has put himself into a one-man witness protection program. He's in hiding. And it's going to be my personal mission, and yours, to root him out! Expose him to the light! There's no hiding from the truth, let's show him that! That's all I have so far. You people figure out the rest.
ROBBIE=>Lighter fluid.
PETER=>It's working.
PETER=>Ditkovich! Ditkovich!
MJ=>Hello?
PETER=>MJ? It's Peter. I-- I want to see you.
MJ=>I can't, Peter. Even if I wanted to see you. Which I'm not totally sure that I do. I already have plans.
PETER=>With Otto Octavius?
MJ=>I don't think that's any of your business, Peter. Goodbye.
OTTO=>You jealous? Silly thing. You know what you and I have is special.
MJ=>Thanks for indulging me. I know it's a
OTTO=>I've never been to Queens before.
MJ=>I really needed it.
OTTO=>I'm sorry the show's not getting any easier for you.
OTTO=>I don't agree. I think you're the most marvelously expressive performer I've ever witnessed.
MJ=>You're sort of gaga over me, aren't you?
OTTO=>Sort of. I hope that's okay.
MJ=>I think so.
OTTO=>I know we haven't known each other for
MJ=>You okay?
OTTO=>Bad back.
OTTO=>So what do you want to do, now?
MJ=>I don't know.
OTTO=>Would you like-- Would you like to come to my place? My home, this time. Not my lab. I've been working on a Mozart trio.
MJ=>You have another Rig at home?
OTTO=>Well, sort of. You see--
MJ=>Otto...
OTTO=>I don't know why human beings persist in believing that mere physical bulk confers some sort of evolutionary advantage.
MAN=>Yeah?
OTTO=>We wanted to show you what we are.
PETER=>Oh oh.
OTTO=>Look at us!
MJ=>Get away from me!
SPIDER-MAN=>Let go of her.
OTTO=>We're out of candy, kid. You'll have to TP the house.
SPIDER-MAN=>Put her down!
MJ=>Go get him. Please. He's not bad.
PETER=>Do you...Do you love him?
MJ=>He's my friend. He's angry. And dangerous. Please, Spider-Man. Don't let him hurt himself.
OTTO=>I'm ready. Come on.
ASSISTANT=>This is Gretchen McCord, in the Anansi lab. I need help. I need doctors. A lot of doctors.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST=>I may need to give him a little more. So are we going to do this or not?
OTTO=>I'm awake.
OTTO=>Not bad for a dying man.
DIRECTOR=>MJ? Talk to you a minute?
MJ=>Bobby, I know I keep screwing up my blocking in the scene with the couch.
DIRECTOR=>You've been fine.
MJ=>I've been working all day with Renard--
DIRECTOR=>Sit down.
MJ=>No, thank you.
DIRECTOR=>Take one. It's a proven fact that it's harder to cry if you have a mint in your mouth.
MJ=>When is she coming back?
DIRECTOR=>Tomorrow night. She's strong and in good voice, and she's all ready to go.
DIRECTOR=>I'm glad you feel that way, MJ, I really am. But, well, there's one more thing I have to tell you.
DIRECTOR=>Well, I just think, and Howard agrees with me, that it would be best. Overall. It's not you, MJ. It's the show. It's just not the best fit. For you.
MJ=>Bobby, can I ask you something? Do you think I have any talent?
DIRECTOR=>Talent? Yes. And guts. Looks, too, if you don't mind my saying so. But--
MJ=>But what?
MJ=>Come on. You'll be doing me a favor.
DIRECTOR=>You seem to have a hard time opening up. Really connecting to the audience. There's something broken way down inside of you that you don't want to let out. Most people don't. But actors have to.
MJ=>Renard?
RENARD=>Oh! MJ Hi. Hey. I heard.
MJ=>I should have known. I don't know why I ever thought I--
RENARD=>Yeah, that's tough. I know how you're feeling.
MJ=>No, you don't. There's only one person who knows how I'm feeling right now.
RECEPTIONIST=>Center for Biomimetic Research.
PETER=>Dr. Octavius, please?
RECEPTIONIST=>Just a moment.
HARSH VOICE=>Who is this?
PETER=>I'm a... friend... of Dr. Octavius.
HARSH VOICE=>Dr. Octavius has resigned his appointment. Who is this?
PETER=>Yeah?
DITKOVICH=>Pretty girl is here.
PETER=>What happened?
PETER=>Those guys are crazy, MJ. That's all I can say. I saw you. You were awesome.
MJ=>You saw me? When did you see me?
PETER=>Oh, I dropped in the other night. You were fantastic! You put everything you have out there, MJ. Everything you are. Right up front. You always have. That's what I've always...
PETER=>I know what a jerk I've been. I understand why you got mad at me. I said I would always be there for you, and then I wasn't. But I swear to you, MJ, things are going to be different now.
MJ=>Why are things going to be different now? Because you started wearing your glasses
PETER=>Because--I can't tell you. But you don't need to worry about it, because I have changed, and--
MJ=>You can't tell me? You can't tell me! Peter Parker, if you can't tell me, if you can't trust me, then nothing has changed at all! You and your little boy secrets!
PETER=>Check, please.
MJ=>Isn't there one semi-normal, grown up human male in this whole goddamn city?
WAITRESS=>I hope that was a rhetorical question.
PETER=>I, uh, I need to get to an ATM.
MJ=>Yeah. Things have really changed a lot.
PETER=>Same thing happened to me one time.
MR. AZIZ=>Peter Parker!
PETER=>It's just I'm flat broke, Mr. Aziz. Please give me another chance.
MR. AZIZ=>I am sorry, Peter, but following your downsizement I have been obliged to hire my nephews from home.
SPIDEY HOOD=>Okay, Hadji, give me everything you got.
MR. AZIZ=>All right, but I hope you have a very modest habit, my friend, because this is not going to buy you much of a fix.
SPIDEY HOOD=>Shut up!
MR. AZIZ=>Thank you, Peter. You are a very good person.
OTTO=>I don't have time to waste, Osborn. I need money. Lots of it. Quickly. And a well-equipped laboratory.
HARRY=>This is nuts, Otto. Are you nuts? You killed one of my security guys! You trashed five million dollars worth of bomb shielding! What the hell's your problem?
OTTO=>We must achieve system equilibrium. Otto can't survive in this intermediate state.
HARRY=>Otto can't?
HARRY=>His spine?
OTTO=>All you need to know is that in return for your--corporate support--for this procedure... I guarantee you that transition to the next level of human evolution will...unavoidably... kill Spider-Man.
SECURITY=>Mr. Osborn! Mr. Osborn!
SECURITY MAN=>Mr. Osborn! Are you all right?
HARRY=>Dad. I know that you were a man of honor. A man who always played by the rules. And I know I'm not supposed to take the law into my own hands.
NORMAN OSBORNE=>"I know I'm not supposed to take the law into my own hands." What a pussy!
NORMAN OSBORNE=>You saw what Spider-Man did to me. He's playing by a different sent of rules. Rules for men. Let this Octopus do it for you, if you aren't man enough to do it yourself. But if he fails... I expect you to avenge me.
HARRY=>I will. I swear!
HARRY=>Octavius? Osborn. You'll get everything you need.
BETTY=>You back on the job?
PETER=>I'm hoping to be.
BETTY=>You sure know how to pick your moments.
JJJ=>You change your mind?!
JJJ=>You can't promise a ten million dollar reward and then change your mind! I've stoked the greed and bloodlust of eight million people to a fever pitch! You're just going to turn your back on that?
HARRY=>I've found a more effective means of obtaining my end.
JJJ=>Yeah? And what is that?
HARRY=>You'll know soon enough.
JJJ=>Oh, really? Tell me this, Osborn... How do I know that you aren't Spider-Man? Eh? Maybe this whole reward thing was just an elaborate dodge. And now that's things are getting a little hot for you, you want to call it off! Your father was a strange character, I always thought so. Maybe you're a little strange, yourself.
HARRY=>You're just a grandstanding hack, Jameson! You don't know what it's like to want revenge so bad you can taste it!
PETER=>Harry? Harry, what's going on?
JJJ=>Jesus, Parker, how many times do I have to fire you?
MAY=>Yes?
OTTO=>Excuse me. I'm looking for Peter Parker.
MAY=>He isn't here. Do you mind my asking what this concerns? Are you a friend of Peter's?
MAY=>What hobby is that?
OTTO=>Spider-Man.
MAY=>Spider-Man? One look at you and I should have known
OTTO=>Please.
MAY=>I haven't seem him in over a week! We had an argument, I threw him out. I don't know where he is! And that's the truth.
OTTO=>We will find Spider-Man. We will flush him out.
MAY=>You do that. Just leave Peter Parker alone.
OTTO=>My name is Otto Octavius. I am a mad scientist. I'm looking for Spider-Man.
OTTO=>My name is Otto Octavius, I am a mad scientist. The destruction will not stop until Spider-Man surrenders himself to me.
TOUR GUIDE=>...found in Oregon, weighing over 15 tons...
OTTO=>It's closer to sixteen.
OTTO=>I'm sure you know who I am by now. Let me repeat. Spider-Man is responsible for the fate of New York City.
WOMAN=>Spider-Man is responsible.
OTTO=>Thank you.
REPORTER=>As the carnage continues, Denise, one question is increasingly on the mind of New Yorkers--where is Spider-Man? If he won't give himself up to Octavius-- why doesn't he stop him?
WOMAN ON TV=>...he told us that Spider-Man is responsible for this. Spider-Man, please. Do as he says.
REPORTER=>Back to you, Denise.
GIRL TALKING HEAD=>Thank you, Rhonda. And, now, here in the studio, we have JJ Jameson, publisher of the New York Daily Bugle. In recent days, your paper had been taking some of the credit for apparently driving Spider Man into hiding. Now that he doesn't seem to want to come out of hiding, do you feel your paper deserves some of the blame for--
JJJ=>For the fact that Spider-Man is a damn coward? Absolutely not! As much as I deplore this Doctor Octopus character's methods--
GIRL TALKING HEAD=>Doctor Octopus?
JJJ=>That's what we're going with, what do you think?
MAY=>Peter?
PETER=>You came all the way over here--with soup?
MAY=>And Boston cream pie.
PETER=>Aunt May, haven't you seen the news? Don't you know what's happening out there?
MAY=>The trains are still running. If the
MAY=>You know, that awful Octopus. He came looking for you. Earlier today.
PETER=>He came to see you? Why?
PETER=>Aunt May. The last time we... at the house... what I told you...
MAY=>You should have told me sooner. And I should have forgiven you before now. It would have been so much easier for both of us.
PETER=>I would have liked that. Things haven't been very easy at all.
MAY=>Peter, I understand the burden that you've been carrying.
PETER=>No, you don't.
MAY=>Yes, I think I do. The sense of guilt. Of responsibility.
PETER=>I'm so sick of that word.
MAY=>But that's how life is, Peter.
PETER=>Why me?
MAY=>Yes, you say, why me? And the answer is, you'll never know the answer to that.
PETER=>It's so hard, Aunt May. I just want to have a normal life. The kind of life--
MAY=>That doesn't break your heart? That would be nice, wouldn't it? Normal, I don't think so.
HARRY=>Why don't you have him yet? What am I paying you for?
OTTO=>He won't come out... I can't flush him.
HARRY=>How is what?
OTTO=>I'm not talking to you!
OTTO=>I see. We have one remaining vector.
HARRY=>Vector? What do you mean.
OTTO=>I mean, I want to see Mary Jane Watson again.
OTTO=>Mary Jane! Mary Jane!
MJ=>Otto... Otto. Why are you doing this?
OTTO=>Why?
POLICEMAN=>That's as far as you can go, buddy.
NYNEX GUY=>He just climbed up the side of a building. He's talking to some girl! He's grabbing her!
COP=>No, you'll hit the girl.
PETER=>MJ! MJ!
MJ=>Peter?
NYNEX GUY=>That dude took my damn truck!
MJ=>Otto! Otto, stop!
OTTO=>Okay. Okay!
MJ=>Let me go.
OTTO=>I can't.
MJ=>I didn't say anything!
OTTO=>I'm not talking to you! Okay. Okay, I'll let go. But don't leave me.
OTTO=>Please. Come. You'll be helping us. We promise.
MJ=>Otto, who is we?
OTTO=>Tell your friend Spider-Man I need to talk to him.
PETER=>I just want to have a normal life. A life--
MAY=>--that doesn't break your heart? That would be nice, wouldn't it?
LOOTER=>Hey, look here, I got me my eight-armed discount.
PETER=>You really should put that back.
LOOTER=>Man, shut up.
PETER=>Hey!
JJJ=>Any sign of him? No?
PETER=>It makes you look fat.
OTTO=>Not bad for a couple of freaks.
SPIDER-MAN=>Speak for yourself.
OTTO=>I speak for us both. You have the greater power--power I need. But I have the strength of knowing what I am. I embrace my freak nature. I revel in it. You will always be fighting against it. That is why I will win this battle.
HARRY=>What.
OTTO=>Your father's soul will soon rest in peace, Mr. Osborn. Meet me at the pier.
HARRY=>MJ? What are you--
OTTO=>Hello, Harry. Come to watch? I guess you've been waiting quite some time for this moment. I suppose before anything
MJ=>Peter? Peter!
HARRY=>No! This isn't-- I'm not--
OTTO=>There's no way to avoid it. We only need pieces of him, really, but they're rather crucial pieces.
MJ=>Otto... please.
OTTO=>Yes, MJ. I can feel you.
MJ=>Otto you are not a killer. Your work is not about killing. Your work is about making us better humans, right? Better at being human.
OTTO=>Better at surviving in this poisonous world.
MJ=>Why? Why survive? Just for the sake of surviving?
OTTO=>You love him.
MJ=>Yes. I do.
OTTO=>I thought there was a place for me in your heart. The first place I ever felt like I belonged.
MJ=>There is, Otto! There is a place. For you. For me. There is.
PETER=>MJ!
MJ=>Hi.
PETER=>This is really heavy.
MJ=>I'm trying. I'm stuck. I think my leg is broken.
PETER=>Least of our worries.
MJ=>If I could just--feel--my foot.
PETER=>MJ. In case we die--
MJ=>You do love me.
PETER=>I do.
MJ=>Even though you said you didn't.
NORMAN OSBORNE=>All right, Harry. It's your turn now.
HARRY=>No. No, Dad. He's my friend.
NORMAN OSBORNE=>Is he. Your friend. I guess that's why he stole your girlfriend. I guess that's why he killed me.
HARRY=>Dad, I don't know. I'm not sure. There's a lot I don't understand.
NORMAN OSBORNE=>"I don't know." "I'm not sure." Harry, you swore an oath! You put your word, your money, your name on the line! You swore to make Spider-Man pay. Now, make him pay!
HARRY=>I swear. I swear!
MJ=>Peter! Peter? I can't reach the--
PETER=>Your mother's coming.
MJ=>You also said... that you loved me.
PETER=>I do love you. I have loved you all my life, Mary Jane Watson. I just can't have you, that's all. The danger, the uncertainty. The hatred. I can't ask that of you. You don't know what it's like. This is my deal. It's my destiny.
MJ=>He's saying you're evil incarnate.
PETER=>I'll call you tomorrow.
MJ=>Peter! You forgot your camera!
PETER=>MJ!
MJ=>Do you know how amazing it is than I can trust you do that? You were given a gift, Peter. I want to share that gift with you. And I want you to share it with me. You don't have to do it alone. I'll help you.
MJ=>What, you think police officers don't get to be in love? Firefighters don't get to be married? That's crazy.
PETER=>But, MJ. This is just--this is just so much weirder than being a policeman.
MJ=>It is weird. But you've always been weird, Peter Parker.
PETER=>Wait, did you say married?
PETER=>There is no Spider-Cave.
MJ'S=>That sucks.
MJ=>Go. Go! I'll be fine.
MJ=>You forgot your camera!
PETER=>It was a five alarm fire. Gas fed. 300 firefighters. And the junior Senator from New York on the seventh floor.
