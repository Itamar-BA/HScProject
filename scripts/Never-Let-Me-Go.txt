KATHY=>My donors have always tended to do better than expected. They are hardly ever classified as agitated, even before a fourth donation.
MATRON=>What’s this from?
TOMMY=>It’s not a rat.
RUTH=>Here it comes!
TOMMY=>It’s not a rat.
KATHY=>Kathy. Kathy H.
MISS LUCY=>So - what was it I said? I believe I was trying to calm him down, because he seemed so upset. And he explained that he was often teased about things like sport, and art. So I told him that he shouldn’t get upset at these things. The other children are only teasing him to get a reaction.
RUTH=>She’s scared all right.
RUTH=>I bet I could prove it.
GIRLS=>Excuse me, miss.
MISS EMILY=>We will of course extend her every curtesy, and make her feel most welcome.
KATHY=>Can I help you?
MISS EMILY=>What constitutes appropriate friction will vary according to the physiology of the sexual partners.
KATHY=>Catch it, Tommy!
KATHY=>Both, I’m sure.
MISS LUCY=>Do you know what happens to children when they grow up?
MISS LUCY=>They might grow up to become actors, and move to America. Or they might work in supermarkets, or teach in schools. They might become sportsmen, or bus conductors, or racing car drivers. They might do almost anything.
KATHY=>Maybe I should have teased him too.
RUTH=>‘So’ not right?
TOMMY=>Just for kicks.
KATHY=>No. I haven’t.
RODNEY=>Yes. That’s her.
RUTH=>It wasn’t her.
RUTH=>If you want to look for possibles, if you want to do it properly, then look in the gutter. That’s where we come from.
TOMMY=>Nothing at all.
KATHY=>No. It doesn’t.
KATHY=>Yes. I’m sure.
MADAME=>From Hailsham...
VOICE=>I suppose it is.
