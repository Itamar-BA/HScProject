LITTLE GIRL=>Hello...
KRISTEN=>Do you live here?
LITTLE GIRL=>Nobody lives here.
KRISTEN=>Where's Freddy?
LITTLE GIRL=>He's not home.
CHILDREN'S VOICES=>One two, Freddy's coming for you...
CHILDREN=>Three four, better lock the door...
KRISTEN=>Calm and cool, I'm calm and cool...
KRISTEN=>He's not here, he's dead. He's not here, he's dead. He's...
KINCAID=>Awww shit, Kristen, not again....
KRISTEN=>Shh...
JOEY=>Thought what? Of dragging us in here?
KINCAID=>Yeah, cut it out. You're puttin' a dent in my beauty sleep.
KRISTEN=>It's Freddy... He's here. I heard him.
KINCAID=>Chill out, Kristen...Freddy's dead, buried, and consecrated. We won, remember?
KRISTEN=>He's back... to get us.
JOEY=>Now way, Kincaid's right, Fred Krueger is history, c'mere...
KRISTEN=>I don't know...
KRISTEN=>How are you, Mr. Johnson?
ALICE=>Hi, Kristen...Rick'll be out any second.
JOHNSON=>You going out dressed like that?
ALICE=>What's wrong with me this time?
KRISTEN=>Uhh, I'll just wait outside.
JOHNSON=>No, it's okay. Maybe you can help her.
KRISTEN=>Something wrong with the stairs?
RICK=>Avoid-all-contact-day.
KRISTEN=>What?
RICK=>When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
JOHNSON=>Waiting for a limo?
RICK=>Okay, honey. I'm off to the club!
DEBBIE=>Alright, anybody have trig this semester?
RICK=>What happened?
DEBBIE=>I had a conflict. Homework or Dynasty. Dynasty won.
RICK=>A sad story. Those soaps'll kill ya.
DEBBIE=>There's Dan Jordan. Mmmmm, we're talkin' major league fox.
ALICE=>Mmmmmm, you know, you are one major league fox.
DAN=>T-T-Thanks Alice...
RICK=>Earth to Alice...
ALICE=>Rick, please.
DEBBIE=>Alright, I think I see salvation...
SHEILA=>Asthma is an inherited condition. If you read a book now and then, you might know something.
DEBBIE=>Speaking of books, isn't trig your favorite?
SHEILA=>Dynasty again, huh? Girl, get a VCR.
JOCK=>Yo, baby, you're sucking on the wrong nozzle.
DEBBIE=>Hey, needledick. I bet you're the only male in this school suffering from penis envy.
SHEILA=>Alright, I owe you one.
RICK=>Supergirl, I think it's dead.
KRISTEN=>Hi...guys.
KINCAID=>Hi guys?!? Hi guys?!?! That's all you got to say after last night?
KRISTEN=>I'm telling you, he's coming back!
KINCAID=>Yo open this sucker up!!
KINCAID=>This ain't my dreamland. KRISTEN. IF YOU HERE I'M GONNA POUND YOUR ASS!!
JOEY=>Let it rest. 'Sides, who knows, you might stir him back up if you keep going in. Kincaid and I'll help, we're still a team, and we ALL have better things to dream about.
KINCAID=>You got that right, signed and sealed.
KRISTEN=>Then what about this?
KINCAID=>That don't mean dick. My dog's like me. Drag him into a crazy dream and he gets wild.
RICK=>We don't kiss and tell. How 'bout you guys?
KRISTEN=>Then you must think I'm a total freak.
RICK=>I go back and forth.
KINCAID=>Come on, Jason, move over.
FREDDY=>You shouldn't've buried me...I'm not dead.
KINCAID=>Take that, mutha-fucker!
FREDDY=>Tell them Freddy sent ya!! HAHAHAHA!
JOHNSON=>First one of the day, scout's honor.
JOHNSON=>I'm late, I know, damn contracts...Let's eat.
ALICE=>We waited a long time.
RICK=>But we gave up. As usual.
JOHNSON=>You call this vegetation a meal after a ten hour work day? What the hell am I? A rabbit? Christ, Alice, can't you try to think a little more?!
ALICE=>Yeah, I can think! I can think of how sick I am watching you drink your life away and taking it out on me!
JOHNSON=>Do I speak in foreign tongues? Alice, I'm talking to you. Are you awake or what?
RICK=>Dad, don't start.
JOHNSON=>Start what? Telling the little daydreamer to wake up? It's long overdue.
RICK=>Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
ALICE=>What?
RICK=>The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.
ALICE=>I don't want to.
RICK=>Yeah. She'd be half as strict as you.
ALICE=>But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
RICK=>Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
ALICE=>Rick...I can't.
RICK=>Never say can't. Just do what I do.
JOEY=>What a great bed!!
FREDDY=>How's this for a wet dream?
JOEY=>Noooo!!!! Kristen! Help!
FREDDY=>Two down. One to go. Hahahaha!
MOM=>Joey, are you asleep already? Joey?
KRISTEN=>I knew you'd be back.
FREDDY=>And then there were none...
KRISTEN=>Kincaid! Joey!
FREDDY=>Elm Street's last brat.
KRISTEN=>Joey! Kincaid!
ALICE=>Here you are. Where were you this morning? Rick's looking all over for you.
KRISTEN=>Have you seen Joey and Kincaid! God, I can't find them. I can't find them anywhere.
ALICE=>I'm sure they're around.
KRISTEN=>Yeah, I'm not so sure.
ALICE=>I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
KRISTEN=>You could do worse.
ALICE=>My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
KRISTEN=>Sounds like a game show host to me.
ALICE=>No really, it's a fable. The 'guardian of good' dreams. It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
KRISTEN=>Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
ALICE=>I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.
KRISTEN=>How'd you learn so much about dreams?
ALICE=>When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
KRISTEN=>I used to bring people into my dreams.
ALICE=>You what?
KRISTEN=>When I used to have nightmares. I brought my friends in to help me. Until they all started dying.
RICK=>What is it?
KRISTEN=>Oh God! He killed them!
NURSE=>Feeling better now?
KRISTEN=>Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
NURSE=>You had a nasty bump.
KRISTEN=>I gotta get out of here.
NURSE=>You just stay put. You need rest.
KRISTEN=>You don't get it, he's after me...
NURSE=>Don't worry, honey
FREDDY=>I need to draw some blood...
NURSE=>Feeling better now?
DAN=>Hi, you seen Rick around?
ALICE=>No...
DAN=>You're his sister, right?
ALICE=>Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.
DAN=>Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan.
ALICE=>I know. Uh...Alice.
DEBBIE=>Sorry, Alice. You're shift's over. My table now.
SHEILA=>Hi, handsome. Care for some buns?
ALICE=>You in a hurry?
SHEILA=>I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.
ALICE=>I know. I hardly have any time to study.
SHEILA=>Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much. You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
ALICE=>I know.
DEBBIE=>He's so cute. I wonder where he works out.
SHEILA=>Please save us, Deb. There IS life after exercise.
DEBBIE=>One of these days I'll fix you up with a real guy. Teach you to get your priorities straight.
ALICE=>I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
DEBBIE=>Give her time. Beauty is skin deep.
SHEILA=>Deb, you're hopeless. Later in life you'll appreciate my motto: mind over matter.
RICK=>Alice, you think you can leave?
ALICE=>What's wrong?
RICK=>Kincaid and Joey died last night.
ALICE=>What?
DAN=>Hey, Rick!
RICK=>Excuse me, ladies. I'll just be a moment.
ALICE=>Kristen, what happened?
KRISTEN=>You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
ALICE=>Who?
KRISTEN=>Rick! C'mon! We gotta go now!
KRISTEN=>Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
RICK=>I though Freddy was just an old town story.
KRISTEN=>It's no story. It happened. Freddy's real and he's back.
DAN=>Hey, c'mon! Everybody has nightmares.
KRISTEN=>You don't know what nightmares are. You play by Freddy's rules. Wake up or die.
DAN=>Nice neighborhood.
RICK=>Hey, c'mon! Give me some room! I hate tight spaces.
KRISTEN=>We're here.
DAN=>So, why the haunted house?
KRISTEN=>Kids died there.
DAN=>Huh?
RICK=>I'll tell you later.
KRISTEN=>It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
RICK=>It's okay, babe. We're with you.
KRISTEN=>I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
DAN=>I don't get it.
RICK=>Let me talk to you.
DAN=>So what's up? What'd I miss?
RICK=>She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
DAN=>So?
RICK=>It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
DAN=>Nice neighborhood.
RICK=>Now it gets weird. She says he comes back in dreams. If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
KRISTEN=>I'm beginning to feel like an endangered species.
ALICE=>"Now I lay me down to sleep..."
KRISTEN=>It's okay. It's only a prayer, no good to Freddy's realm.
ELAINE=>Kristen! Get the hell away form that house and get in this car. Andele!
RICK=>Don't go if you don't want to. I can take care of you.
KRISTEN=>I better go.
RICK=>I'll call you tonight. We'll get through this.
ELAINE=>Something the matter with the cuisine?
KRISTEN=>Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
ELAINE=>You're just tired. Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping. That has to stop, honey.
KRISTEN=>What's wrong with me?
ELAINE=>Your distraught. It'll help...
KRISTEN=>Oh, God...No...What'd you do?
ELAINE=>I'm sorry honey, but...
KRISTEN=>Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
ELAINE=>Honey, we went over this in therapy.
KRISTEN=>Mother, you've just murdered me. Take that to your goddamn therapy...
FREDDY=>Time to turn, or else you'll burn!
FREDDY=>Do it til ya dizzy...hahahahaha!
KRISTEN=>We beat you before!
FREDDY=>But you're all alone!
KRISTEN=>Never...I'm the last.
FREDDY=>Reach out and touch someone.
KRISTEN=>ALICE!!
FREDDY=>How sweet! Fresh meat!
KRISTEN=>Come on!! Wake up and get OUT!! It was a mistake, oh God I'm sorry.
FREDDY=>NOW, NO ONE SLEEPS! AHHHH!
KRISTEN=>You'll need my power...
RICK=>You alright?
ALICE=>Kristen...
RICK=>Kristen!
DAN=>Hey man, we're all sorry...
RICK=>She knew she was gonna die.
DEBBIE=>You mean it was like, suicide?
DAN=>I thought it was an accident. Smoking in bed.
ALICE=>It was no suicide. It was not an accident. It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
DEBBIE=>Come on, Freddy's not real. She couldn't have been serious?
DAN=>I mean, you can't really believe that.
ALICE=>I was there in the dream. He took her. It was awful. It was awful...
DAN=>"In her dream"?
RICK=>Something's very wrong here.
DEBBIE=>What?
RICK=>For a minute she...well, reminded me of Kristen.
DAN=>Weren't they close?
RICK=>Not that close.
ALICE=>I don't smoke. Kristen, what did you do to me?
SHEILA=>Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
ALICE=>We have matching luggage.
SHEILA=>What?
ALICE=>You've been up all night?
SHEILA=>That obvious, huh?
ALICE=>Then you saw him, too?
SHEILA=>Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together. Look...
TEACHER=>Alright...you have forty minutes. Good luck and go to it.
FREDDY=>School's out.
ALICE=>Didn't you see it? He was here.
STUDENT=>The test wasn't that bad...
DEBBIE=>Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack? She was gonna be a doctor.
ALICE=>It was Freddy.
DEBBIE=>Enough of that crap.
ALICE=>I saw it. It was my dream. I brought Sheila in...
RICK=>C'mon...
ALICE=>No, don't! I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
DAN=>Kristen's story really got to her.
RICK=>I'm not so sure it's a story. I mean, look around, we're dropping off like flies here.
ALICE=>Rick?
JOHNSON=>Hi. I heard about what happened at the school. I guess I haven't been very much of a father through this.
ALICE=>It's not your fault.
JOHNSON=>Nah, I've been using that excuse since your mother died.
RICK=>I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one?
ALICE=>It was bad.
RICK=>Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
ALICE=>I can't find him.
RICK=>Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison? This looks like Sheila's.
ALICE=>It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
RICK=>Yeah, or turn you into toast.
ALICE=>I can't go back to sleep again.
RICK=>I haven't slept much either. Since Kristen...
ALICE=>I miss her, too. She gave me her ability but I don't know how to use it. I can bring people into my dream, but I can't protect them.
RICK=>We'll figure it out.
ALICE=>Figure it out?!?! I'll be insane before I figure it out. The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep. Not while he's using me.
RICK=>Then we'll stay up together.
DAN=>Hey, how ya doin'?
ALICE=>I've been working double shifts.
DAN=>Extra money, huh?
ALICE=>Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
DAN=>No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
ALICE=>The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
DAN=>How long have you been awake?
ALICE=>Three days.
DAN=>Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
ALICE=>Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy. Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me. Someone to bring them to him.
GIRL=>Danny, we're going to be late for the drive-in!
ALICE=>I have to get back.
BUDDY=>Ninety-three days until summer.
DAN=>What's the matter man, getting tired?
BUDDY=>No, I'm getting worried. Let's see if we survive until summer. It's been open season this semester. Pretty weird stuff.
DAN=>Hey! Learn to shut up, asshole!
RICK=>Been up with Alice.
DAN=>How she doing? I ran into her last night.
RICK=>She's blaming herself for Sheila. I know how it feels. I've been thinking about Kristen. Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
DAN=>About Freddy?
RICK=>What else? You ever look over this town's history? Not a safe place to be a teenager. Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
COACH=>Hey you bozos, up and out! NOW!!
LECTURER=>Every society, dating back to the ancients, has had theories regarding dreams, what they mean, how to control them. Aristotle believed that during sleep you soul roams free. What it sees are dreams. Skilled dreamers control what they see. There is a theory that there are two gates your soul can enter, one a positive gate, the other a negative. The dreammaster guards the positive gate and protects its sleeping host. There are fewer theories about the negative gate...
KRISTEN=>C'mon, Rick. Make me laugh.
FREDDY=>Going down. Women's wear, lingerie, cutlery, butcher knives. China...
RICK=>What the...
FREDDY=>A true warrior, Rick-san, needs no eyes.
RICK=>Come out and fight me, you chicken shit.
FREDDY=>Ninja warriors have calm. Find your balance, Rick.
RICK=>Too wimpy to show yourself, Krueger? Well, how's this for balance?
FREDDY=>Hari-kari to you and your balance, boy. Sayonara, Rick-san.
ALICE=>Nooooo!!!!
COACH=>Hey, Johnson! Let's go!!
DAN=>And then there were none.
RICK=>Great goof, huh? They think I'm dead. I love it!
DAN=>Alice...Alice?
ALICE=>Not really.
DAN=>Is there something we can do?
ALICE=>I don't think so. I guess this is my own war.
DEBBIE=>No it isn't. We all gotta survive.
ALICE=>You don't really get it. He's not a nightstalker. It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
DAN=>Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
ALICE=>Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.
DAN=>Then what else can we do?
ALICE=>Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
DAN=>Who?
DEBBIE=>I know just the guy.
ALICE=>What's happening to me?
JOHNSON=>No, you're not leaving this house.
ALICE=>Get out of my way you pathetic lush.
JOHNSON=>Honey, I may be a drunk, but I want you here. We're all we have...
ALICE=>Dad, please...
JOHNSON=>Nope, gonna watch you, didn't watch him, lost him, won't lose you...you're stayin' in...
DAN=>All the towns in America, I had to move to the Bermuda triangle.
ALICE=>Noooooo!
WAITRESS=>What'll it be?
FREDDY=>If the food don't kill ya, the service will, hahaha!
FREDDY=>Ahhhh! The usual!
FACES=>Free us, Alice! Free us!!
FREDDY=>I love SOUL FOOD! Bring me more!!
FREDDY=>Your shift is over.
ALICE=>C'mon, we have to hurry. I'm driving.
ALICE=>He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
DAN=>Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you.
ALICE=>You just feel sorry for me.
DAN=>Cut that shit out. Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
DAN=>As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
ALICE=>It's okay, we're just about there.
ALICE=>Here we are.
ALICE=>C'mon, we have to hurry. I'm driving.
DEBBIE=>I don't believe in you...
FREDDY=>I believe in you...
ALICE=>He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him.
DEBBIE=>Give me back my BODY!!!
ALICE=>Here we are...
ALICE=>C'mon, we have to hurry. I'm driving.
ALICE=>He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him.
DAN=>You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
ALICE=>Here we are.
DAN=>Something's wrong here. It feels like...
ALICE AND DAN=>C'mon, we have to hurry. I'm driving.
ALICE=>Oh God, I'm still asleep. He's got us going in circles.
FREDDY=>You can check in, but you can't check out!
DAN=>What the hell was that?
ALICE=>Debbie. She's gone. I've...collected her, like the others.
ALICE=>Alright, asleep or awake, I'm gonna punch his ticket in.
ALICE=>Oh Dan, I'm sorry. GOD, I'M SORRY!!!
ALICE=>What's that do?
PARAMEDIC=>Relaxes your boyfriend.
ALICE=>Put the needle down.
PARAMEDIC=>Sorry doctor, rules is rules.
ALICE=>He stays awake, those are my rules, understand?
PARAMEDIC=>Shoulda said so in the first place.
ALICE=>Don't let them put you to sleep.
ALICE=>When do you operate? When does he hit surgery?
DOCTOR=>From the looks of him, probably 15 minutes.
JOHNSON=>Let it be, Alice. They'll help him.
ALICE=>They're gonna kill him.
JOHNSON=>Alice, dammit, get back here.
ALICE=>Couldn't hurt.
DAN=>I'll take the pain...no gas...no gas...have to stay up.
ALICE=>This ends. Now.
ALICE=>Now I lay me down to sleep.
ALICE'S REFLECTION=>The master of dreams, my soul I'll keep.
ALICE=>In the reflection of my mind's eye.
ALICE'S REFLECTION=>Evil sees itself and it shall DIE!!!
ALICE=>Fuckin' A.
DAN=>Freddy!!!
FREDDY=>It ain't Dr. Seuss! Hahahaha!
DAN=>No, Alice! Alice!!!
DAN=>Alice!!!
ALICE=>Get away from him you SONOFABITCH!!!
DAN=>You look great!
ALICE=>Save it for later. Come on!
FREDDY=>Welcome to wonderland, Alice! Hahahaha!
ALICE=>Nooo!!!
DOCTOR=>Christ, he's hemorrhaging badly! Close it off and bring him out of it! Hurry!
CHILDREN=>One two, Freddy's coming for you. Three four, better lock your door...
DAN=>No! Dammit, Alicceeeee.....
DOCTOR=>Relax, son. It was rough, but we pulled you out.
DAN=>Put me back under. Please! Put me back!
DOCTOR=>What the hell?? Just a while ago you were screaming not to be put under.
DAN=>Well I changed my mind!!!
FREDDY=>You think you got what it takes, I been guarding my gate forever, hahaha!
CHILDREN=>For in the reflection of my mind's eye...
ALICE=>Let evil see itself...
ALICE AND KIDS=>And it SHALL DIE!
ALICE=>LET THEM OUT!!!!
ALICE=>Rest in hell.
