DECREED AGAINST THE JEWS:=>We can no longer neglect the complaints of the people against the Jews. They despise the holy ceremonies of Christ. They endanger the lives and property of their fellow-men. They work black magic. We decree that all Jews shall be expelled from the city and all adjoining land before the end of the month.
FLORIAN=>grins his delight.
