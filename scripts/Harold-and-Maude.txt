MRS. CHASEN=>I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
MRS. CHASEN=>Hello. Fay, darling. Be a dear and cancel my appointment with Rene this afternoon. Yes, I know he'll be furious, but I've had the most trying day, and with guests coming this evening... Would you? Oh, that's sweet. Tell him I promise to be in Tuesday... for a rinse. Thank you, Fay. You're a darling. Yes. Yes. Bye.
MRS. CHASEN=>Dinner at eight, Harold...
MRS. CHASEN=>... And try to be a little more vivacious.
MRS. CHASEN=>Needless to say, the first time it happened I was absolutely abashed. I was so shook I needed three tranquilizers to calm me down. Well, you can imagine. Suicide notes all over the house - "Goodbye," "Farewell," "Arrivederci." Other children pretend to run away from home, but Harold - he's so dramatic.
MRS. CHASEN=>Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
HAROLD=>I have a sore throat.
MRS. CHASEN=>Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
MRS. CHASEN=>Oh! No! Oh! No! I can't stand it. My God! This is too much. This is too much to bear!...
PSYCHIATRIST=>Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
HAROLD=>An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
PSYCHIATRIST=>And why is that?
HAROLD=>Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
PSYCHIATRIST=>Just give me a rough estimate.
HAROLD=>Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Fifteen.
HAROLD=>A rough estimate.
PSYCHIATRIST=>And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
HAROLD=>I wouldn't say "benefit."
PSYCHIATRIST=>No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
HAROLD=>I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Does that worry you?
HAROLD=>Yes. It does.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Why?
HAROLD=>I put a lot of effort into these things.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Ah, yes.
HAROLD=>And a lot of time.
PSYCHIATRIST=>I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
HAROLD=>No.
PSYCHIATRIST=>What about the draft?
HAROLD=>My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
HAROLD=>You mean when I'm not working on a...
PSYCHIATRIST=>Yes. What kind of things do you do?
PSYCHIATRIST=>I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
HAROLD=>I don't know.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
HAROLD=>No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
PSYCHIATRIST=>What else do you like?
PSYCHIATRIST=>That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging. Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for fun? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
HAROLD=>I go to funerals.
MRS. CHASEN=>Why you purchased that monstrous thing is totally beyond me. You can have any car you want - a Porsche, a Jaguar, a nice little MG roadster - but that ugly, black horror is an eyesore and an embarrassment. Really, Harold, you are no longer a child. It's time for you to settle down and stop flitting away your talents on these amateur theatrics - your little "divertissements" - no matter how psychologically purging they may be. I don't know what to do.
UNCLE VICTOR=>I'd put him in the Army, Helen.
MRS. CHASEN=>Go have a talk with your Uncle Victor. Perhaps he can fathom you. After all, he was General Bradley's right hand man.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Harold, your mother has briefed me on your situation and there is no doubt in my mind of the requisite necessary action. If it was up to me I'd process your file and ship you off to boot camp tomorrow. Your mother, however, is adamant. She does not want you in the Army and insists on my holding on to your draft records. But what do you say, Harold? It's a great life. Action! Adventure! Advising. See war - firsthand! Plenty of slant-eyed girls. It will make a man out of you, Harold. You'll travel the world. Put on the uniform and take on a man's job. Walk tall! - with a glint in your eye, a spring in your step, and the knowledge in your heart that you are - - working for peace, and - are serving your country.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Like Nathan Hale. That's what this country needs - more Nathan Hales.
UNCLE VICTOR=>And, Harold, I think I can see a little Nathan Hale in you.
MRS. CHASEN=>I only have a few minutes, Harold, but I do want to inform you of my decision. There is no doubt that it is time for you to settle down and begin thinking about your future. You have led a very carefree, idle, happy life up to the present - the life of a child. But it is time now to put away childish things and take on adult responsibilities. We would all like to sail through life with no thought of tomorrow. But that cannot be. We have our duty. Our obligations. Our principles. In short, Harold, I think it is time you got married.
PRIEST=>And so dear brethren, let us pray to the Lord, King of Glory, that He may bless and deliver all souls of the faithful departed from the pains of hell and the bottomless pit, deliver them from the lion's mouth and the darkness therein, but rather bring them to the bliss of heaven, the holy light, and eternal rest.
MAUDE=>Psst.
MAUDE=>Like some licorice?
HAROLD=>Eh, no. Thank you.
MAUDE=>You're welcome. Did you know him?
HAROLD=>Eh, no.
MAUDE=>Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
HAROLD=>I don't know.
MAUDE=>I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
MAUDE=>I'll never understand this mania for black. I mean no one sends black flowers, do they? Black flowers are dead flowers and who would send black flowers to a funeral? It's change! How absurd.
MAUDE=>There, that's better. They never give the poor thing a chance to laugh. Heaven knows she has a lot to be happy about. In fact... - they all have a lot to be happy about. Excuse me.
MAUDE=>And why do they keep on about that? You'd think no one ever read the end of the story.
MAUDE=>It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
HAROLD=>Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
MAUDE=>Oh, of course. What is your name?
HAROLD=>Harold Chasen.
MAUDE=>How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
HAROLD=>Nice to meet you.
MAUDE=>Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
MAUDE=>Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
HAROLD=>No, thank you. I have my car.
MAUDE=>Well then, I must be off. We shall have to meet again.
MAUDE=>Do you dance?
HAROLD=>What?
MAUDE=>Do you sing and dance?
HAROLD=>Eh, no.
MAUDE=>No. I thought not.
PRIEST=>That woman... She took my car.
MRS. CHASEN=>I have here, Harold, the forms sent out by the National Computer Dating Service. It seems to me that as you do not get along with the daughters of my friends this is the best way for you to find a prospective wife.
MRS. CHASEN=>Please, Harold, we have a lot to do and I have to be at the hairdresser's at three. The Computer Dating Service offers you at least three dates on the initial investment. They screen out the fat and ugly so it is obviously a firm of high standards. I'm sure they can find you at least one girl who is compatible. Now first, here is the personality interview which you are to fill out and return. There are fifty questions with five possible responses to check... "A - Absolutely Yes, B - Yes, C - Not sure, D - No, E - Absolutely No." Are you ready, Harold?
MRS. CHASEN=>"Four - Do you often invite friends to your home?" Now, you never do, Harold. Absolutely no. "Five - Do you enjoy participating in clubs and social organizations?" You don't, do you? Absolutely no. "Six - Do you enjoy spending a lot of time by yourself?" Absolutely yes. Mark "A." "Seven - Should women run for President of the United States?" I don't see why not. Absolutely yes. "Eight - Do you have ups and downs without obvious reason?" You do, don't you, Harold? Absolutely yes. "Nine - Do you remember jokes and take pleasure in relating them to others?" You don't, do you, Harold? Absolutely no. "Ten - Do you often get the feeling that perhaps life isn't worth living?" Hmm. What do you think, Harold?
MRS. CHASEN=>"A"? "B"? We'll put down "C" - "Not sure." "Eleven - Is the subject of sex being over-exploited by our mass media?" That would have to be "Yes," wouldn't it? "Twelve - Do you think judges favor some lawyers?" Yes, I suppose they do. "Thirteen - ....
MRS. CHASEN=>... Is it difficult for you to accept criticism?" Nooo. We'll mark "D." "Fourteen - Do you sometimes have headaches or back aches after a difficult day?" Yes, I do indeed. "Fifteen - Do you go to sleep easily?" I'd say so. "Sixteen - Do you believe in capital punishment for murder?" Oh, yes. "Seventeen - Do you believe churches have a strong influence to upgrade the general morality?" - yes, again. "Eighteen - In your opinion are social affairs usually a waste of time?" Heavens, no! "Nineteen - Can God influence our lives?" Yes. Absolutely yes. "Twenty - Have you ever crossed the street to avoid meeting someone?" Well, I'm sure you have, haven't you, Harold? "Twenty-one - Would you prefer to be with a group of people rather than alone?" That's you, Harold. "Twenty-two - Is it acceptable for a schoolteacher to smoke or drink in public?" Well, with reservation. Mark "B." "Twenty-three..."
MRS. CHASEN=>... Does your personal religion or philosophy include a life after death?" Oh, yes, indeed. That's "Absolutely." "Twenty-four - Did you enjoy life when you were a child?" Oh, yes. You were a wonderful baby, Harold. "Twenty- five..."
MRS. CHASEN=>... "Do you think the sexual revolution has gone too far?" It certainly seems to have. "Twenty- six...
MRS. CHASEN=>Harold! Please! "Should evolution be taught in our public schools?!"
MAUDE=>Psst! Psst!
PRIEST=>Eh, my boy. A moment, please. Who was that old lady waving to you earlier?
MAUDE=>Hello, Harold. Can I give you a lift?
PRIEST=>Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
MAUDE=>Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
PRIEST=>Yes.
MAUDE=>Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
PRIEST=>Were you also the one who painted the statues?
MAUDE=>Oh, yes. How did you like that?
PRIEST=>Well, I didn't.
MAUDE=>Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
PRIEST=>But wait...
MAUDE=>What a delight it is, Harold, to bump into you again. I knew we were going to be good friends the moment I saw you. You go to funerals often, don't you?
HAROLD=>Yes.
MAUDE=>Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end - - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
HAROLD=>Yes.
MAUDE=>Well, it's a new experience for me. Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
HAROLD=>But this is my car.
MAUDE=>Your hearse?
HAROLD=>Yearse!
MAUDE=>Oh.
MAUDE=>Then you shall take me home.
MAUDE=>And so just before he left for the monastery in Tibet, Big Sweeney gave me his keys.
MAUDE=>Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
HAROLD=>And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
MAUDE=>Not any car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
HAROLD=>Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
MAUDE=>What owners, Harold? We don't own anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
HAROLD=>Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
MAUDE=>Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to things. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
MAUDE=>... I've collected quite a lot of stuff in my time.
MAUDE=>It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
HAROLD=>It's very interesting.
MAUDE=>Oh, look! The birds.
MAUDE=>This is my daily ritual. I love them so much. The only wild life I see anymore. Free as a bird! You know, at one time I used to break into pet shops and liberate the canaries, but I gave it up as an idea before its time. The zoos are full and the prisons overflowing.
MAUDE=>She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
HAROLD=>Thank you, but I really have to go.
MAUDE=>But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
HAROLD=>No.
MAUDE=>Well then.
HAROLD=>Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
MAUDE=>Oh, at the dentist's?
HAROLD=>Sort of.
MAUDE=>Well, then, you must come back and visit.
HAROLD=>All right.
MAUDE=>My door is always open.
HAROLD=>All right.
MAUDE=>Promise?
HAROLD=>Promise.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Harold?
PSYCHIATRIST=>Harold?
HAROLD=>Huh?
PSYCHIATRIST=>You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
HAROLD=>No.
PSYCHIATRIST=>None at all?
HAROLD=>Well, maybe one.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Would you care to talk about this friend?
HAROLD=>No.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
HAROLD=>No.
PSYCHIATRIST=>I see. Were you happy at school, Harold?
HAROLD=>Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST=>You liked your teachers?
HAROLD=>Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Your classmates?
HAROLD=>Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Your studies?
HAROLD=>Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Then why did you leave?
HAROLD=>I burnt down the Chemistry building.
PSYCHIATRIST=>We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
HAROLD=>Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Very well. Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
PSYCHIATRIST=>I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
HAROLD=>No. I'd have liked to.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Why?
HAROLD=>I'd have liked to talk to him.
PSYCHIATRIST=>What would you say?
HAROLD=>I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
PSYCHIATRIST=>What kind of stuff?
MRS. CHASEN=>Now listen, Harold, I have here the three girls sent out by the Computer Dating Service.
MRS. CHASEN=>I've phoned them up and invited each of them to have lunch with us before you take them out. The first one is coming tomorrow at one. Luncheon at two.
MRS. CHASEN=>Now I want you to act like a gentleman and make this girl feel at home.
CANDY=>Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
MRS. CHASEN=>How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
MRS. CHASEN=>Harold is out in the garden. He'll be in in a moment. Let's go into the den.
MRS. CHASEN=>You are at the University, Candy?
CANDY=>Yes, I am.
MRS. CHASEN=>And what are you studying?
CANDY=>Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
MRS. CHASEN=>Eh, Poli Sci?
CANDY=>Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
MRS. CHASEN=>Oh, there's Harold now.
CANDY=>He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
MRS. CHASEN=>Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
CANDY=>Heavens no. I don't have to worry about dates. You see, the other girls in my sorority, well, we decided that somebody should try it, so we drew straws and I lost. But I am looking forward to meeting Harold.
MRS. CHASEN=>I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
CANDY=>Oh, yes? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
MRS. CHASEN=>Yes. I'm sure it must have been very funny.
CANDY=>Har -- Haro -- Haroldddd!!!
MRS. CHASEN=>Yes, dear. Here is Harold now.
MRS. CHASEN=>Candy, this is Harold.
MRS. CHASEN=>Candy was just telling a funny story about Walter Cronkite.
HAROLD=>Maude. Maude. Anybody home?
HAROLD=>Excuse me, have you seen Maude?
HAROLD=>Maude. Do you know where she is?
HAROLD=>Maude?
MADAME AROUET=>Ah! Maude.
HAROLD=>Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Merci.
HAROLD=>Oh. Excuse me.
GLAUCUS=>What do you want?
HAROLD=>I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
MAUDE=>Harold?
HAROLD=>Maude???!
MAUDE=>How about some ginger pie?
HAROLD=>Eh, fine.
MAUDE=>I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
HAROLD=>Oh, it's fine. Fine.
MAUDE=>She seemed yare to me.
HAROLD=>Do you often model for Glaucus?
MAUDE=>Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form. Do you disapprove?
HAROLD=>Me! No. Of course not.
MAUDE=>Really. Do you think it's wrong?
HAROLD=>No.
MAUDE=>Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
MAUDE=>A self-portrait. But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
HAROLD=>Yes. Very much.
MAUDE=>It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
MAUDE=>Give the nose a treat, I thought. Have a kind of olfactory banquet! So I began first on the easiest - roast beef, old books, mown grass, then I went on to these - "An Evening at Maxim's." "Mexican Farmyard." Here's one you'd like. "Snowfall on 42nd Street." Put it on.
MAUDE=>Now I'll pump it up... ... and you just turn the handles. Okay. What do you smell?
HAROLD=>Subways... Perfume... Cigarette... ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... Snow!
MAUDE=>It goes on and on.
HAROLD=>That's really great.
MAUDE=>Thank you. I thought of continuing - graduating to the abstract and free-smelling - but then I decided to switch to the tactile.
MAUDE=>What do you think?
HAROLD=>Oh. Eh, I like it.
MAUDE=>No, you have to touch it. You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
MAUDE=>That's right. How's the sensation?
MAUDE=>Oh, that's the kettle. Go ahead, Harold. Stroke, palm, caress, explore.
MAUDE=>Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
HAROLD=>Certainly a new experience for me.
MAUDE=>Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
HAROLD=>You look as if you could.
MAUDE=>Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
HAROLD=>You don't look eighty.
MAUDE=>That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing. Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire! Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
HAROLD=>That's a nice teapot.
MAUDE=>Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived. Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold. What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
MAUDE=>Yes. There is definitely a certain attraction.
MAUDE=>Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
HAROLD=>What do you mean?
MAUDE=>I love to watch things grow.
MAUDE=>They grow and bloom, and fade, and die, and some change into something else. Ah, life!
MAUDE=>I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so tall and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
HAROLD=>I don't know. Just one of those.
MAUDE=>Why do you say that?
HAROLD=>Because they are all the same.
MAUDE=>Oooh, but they are not. Look.
MAUDE=>See - some are smaller, some are fatter, some grow to the left, some to the right, some even have some petals missing - all kinds of observable differences, and we haven't even touched the bio- chemical. You see, Harold, they're like the Japanese. At first you think they all look alike, but after you get to know them you see there is not a repeat in the bunch. Each person is different, never existed before and never to exist again. Just like this daisy - - an individual.
HAROLD=>Well, we may be individuals all right but - - we have to grow up together.
MAUDE=>Yes, that's very true. Still I believe much of the world's sorrow comes from people who know they are this - - yet let themselves be treated - - as that.
MAUDE=>Ha! Power steering.
HAROLD=>Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
MAUDE=>Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were alive, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals. Of course, the age has its advantages.
MAUDE=>The universal language of mankind. What music do you like, Harold?
HAROLD=>Well...
HAROLD=>What happened?
MAUDE=>Look.
HAROLD=>What?
MAUDE=>Over there by the courthouse.
HAROLD=>What is it?
MAUDE=>That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
MAUDE=>Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
HAROLD=>But what?
MAUDE=>We'll transplant it. To the forest.
HAROLD=>But we can't just dig it up!
MAUDE=>Why not?
HAROLD=>But this is public property.
MAUDE=>Exactly.
HAROLD=>Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
MAUDE=>Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
HAROLD=>Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
MAUDE=>Oh, the police. Come on.
MAUDE=>Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
OFFICER=>Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
MAUDE=>Well, it's a tricky turn.
OFFICER=>Eh, yes, ma'm.
MAUDE=>Tell me -- -- is that car parked all right?
OFFICER=>Oh yes. That's fine.
MAUDE=>Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
MAUDE=>Oh, my. We're too late.
HAROLD=>Is he all right?
MAUDE=>He's fallen asleep, as usual.
MAUDE=>We'll come back in the morning.
HAROLD=>What is that he's working on?
MAUDE=>An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
HAROLD=>It is kind of rough.
MAUDE=>He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
HAROLD=>Look, the ice is melting.
MAUDE=>Yes.
MAUDE=>That's one of the drawbacks of the medium.
MAUDE=>A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
HAROLD=>Well, I really don't drink...
MAUDE=>Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
HAROLD=>Thank you.
MAUDE=>Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
HAROLD=>Thank you.
HAROLD=>What's that?
MAUDE=>My umbrella? Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition. A long time ago.
HAROLD=>What were you fighting for?
MAUDE=>Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier. Later, Frederick would chide me about it. He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
MAUDE=>But, that was all... before...
HAROLD=>So you don't use the umbrella any more?
MAUDE=>No.
HAROLD=>No more revolts.
MAUDE=>Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
HAROLD=>Well, I don't...
MAUDE=>Oh come on. I'll teach you.
MAUDE=>Come on, Harold, join in the chorus.
MAUDE=>Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
HAROLD=>But I don't play anything.
MAUDE=>Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
MAUDE=>Here we are. Just the thing.
MAUDE=>That's right. But be impulsive! Be fanciful! Let the music flow out of you as freely as though you were talking. Okay? From the top -- Let's jam!
HAROLD=>Okay?
MAUDE=>Superb.
MRS. CHASEN=>Harold! Harold! Ah, there you are. I have a little present for you. A surprise. Come with me.
MRS. CHASEN=>There!
MRS. CHASEN=>Isn't that darling? I had them tow off that black monstrous thing of yours and had them send this around instead. It's so much more appropriate for you, don't you think?
MRS. CHASEN=>One more thing, Harold. I've talked on the phone with your second computer date and she seems a very nice, quiet girl. Not at all hysterical like the first one. Nevertheless I want you to be on your best behavior when she comes tomorrow and make her feel at home. Cute little thing, isn't it? I like it very much.
GLAUCUS=>Come in. Come in.
MAUDE=>Have you seen Harold?
GLAUCUS=>One moment.
GLAUCUS=>Ah, Dame Marjorie. Greetings. As Odysseus said to Penelope...
HAROLD=>Sorry I'm late.
GLAUCUS=>A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one. Tell me, what do you see?
HAROLD=>A block of ice.
GLAUCUS=>Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
HAROLD=>What do you see?
GLAUCUS=>I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
GLAUCUS=>Each morning I am delivered of a new block of ice. Each evening my eyes grow weary, my hands hang heavy, and I am swept down Lethe to slumber - - while my goddess, half-born, drips away - unseen, unsung, and unknown.
MAUDE=>May we borrow a shovel?
GLAUCUS=>Wait! Let me think. Do I need a shovel today? No! I need a blowtorch. Take any shovel. You are welcome.
MAUDE=>Thank you, Glaucus. We'll see you later. Come on, Harold.
GLAUCUS=>Farewell, my friends. "Where'er he moved, the goddess shone before" - Homer!
COP=>Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
MAUDE=>Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
COP=>Yes.
MAUDE=>Oh, I don't have one.
COP=>Come again.
MAUDE=>I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
COP=>How long have you been driving?
MAUDE=>About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
COP=>Could I see your registration?
MAUDE=>I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
COP=>Isn't this your vehicle?
MAUDE=>No, no. I just took it.
COP=>Took it?
MAUDE=>Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
COP=>Your tree.
MAUDE=>Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
COP=>Lady, let me get this straight.
MAUDE=>All right, then, and we'll be off. Nice chatting with you.
HAROLD=>I think he's following us.
MAUDE=>Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
HAROLD=>He's stopped.
MAUDE=>The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
MAUDE=>There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars." Who said that?
HAROLD=>I don't know.
MAUDE=>I suppose I did. Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
MAUDE=>I come here as often as I can. It's exhilarating. What do you call it? Nature! Life! Soul! God! At any rate, it's here, and...
MAUDE=>... we are part of it.
COP=>Okay, lady. Out.
MAUDE=>Hello.
MAUDE=>Haven't we met before?
COP=>None of that, lady.
MAUDE=>Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
COP=>Out!
MAUDE=>But there is a family resemblance.
COP=>You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
MAUDE=>We planted it.
COP=>Is this your shovel?
MAUDE=>No.
COP=>Possession of a stolen shovel.
MAUDE=>Officer, I can explain.
COP=>Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
MAUDE=>Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
COP=>Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
MAUDE=>Check.
COP=>And that truck - is it registered in your name?
MAUDE=>Oh no! Not in my name.
COP=>Then whose name is it registered in?
MAUDE=>Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
COP=>Where are the papers?
MAUDE=>I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
COP=>Wait here.
MAUDE=>Because if you are...
COP=>Lady! Be quiet.
MAUDE=>Grab the shovel, Harold.
COP=>Stop! Or I'll shoot!
MAUDE=>Oh! It's just like the Resistance.
GLAUCUS=>The bitter dregs of Fortune's cup to drain - The Iliad... Almost finished... Gotta make it... Going to make it... Liberate Love... Set her free.
MAUDE=>Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
HAROLD=>Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
GLAUCUS=>Cold... Yes... Yes... Gotta turn up the heat... Excuse me...
HAROLD=>Here's your shovel.
GLAUCUS=>What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
GLAUCUS=>Not giving up... Just for a minute ... Then once more up the hill...
HAROLD=>I think I see it.
MAUDE=>Yes. It's almost there.
GLAUCUS=>Yes... almost done... have a little rest. Not long... Just a little rest... then once more up the hill...
HAROLD=>I think he's asleep.
GLAUCUS=>Aha! Morpheus. I'll...
GLAUCUS=>Gonna make it... Gonna make it... Make it...
HAROLD=>The ice is melting.
MAUDE=>Yes.
HAROLD=>Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
MAUDE=>Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
HAROLD=>I like Glaucus.
MAUDE=>Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
HAROLD=>Well, I really don't smoke.
MAUDE=>It's all right. It's organic.
HAROLD=>I'm sure picking up on vices.
MAUDE=>Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
HAROLD=>Did Confucius say that?
MAUDE=>Well -- - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
HAROLD=>You are the wisest person I know.
MAUDE=>Me! When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away." Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
HAROLD=>Yes. I haven't lived. I've died a few times.
MAUDE=>What was that?
HAROLD=>Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming. Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
MAUDE=>How ingenious! Tell me about them.
HAROLD=>Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
MAUDE=>Of course.
HAROLD=>Okay.
HAROLD=>Well, the first time it wasn't even planned. It was when I was at boarding school and they were getting ready for the school Centennial Celebration and they put all the fireworks and food and stuff in this room in the West Wing. Well, on the floor above they had the Chemistry Lab and I had to stay in and clean it up. So I thought I'd do a little experimenting. I got all this stuff out and began mixing it up. It was very scientific. I was measuring the amounts. Well, suddenly there was this big fizzing sound and this white kind of porridge stuff began erupting out of the beaker, and moving along the desk and falling onto the floor. It was making an awful mess. So I got the hose to try to spray it into the sink. I turned on the water and - POW! There was this massive explosion. Knocked me down. Blew out the floor. Boards and brick and flames leaping up. Singed my hair. Smoke everywhere. I got up, then this sound like bombs going off. It was the fireworks in the room below. And all this stuff came flying out the hole. PACHAU! Skyrockets and pinwheels. And fire balls all whizzing and bouncing. And I was just standing there stunned - I couldn't believe it - just watching - being pelted by all these little pellets - turns out to be the goddamn popcorn spewed up from below. The whole place was a crazy inferno with the rockets and everything, and I couldn't get to the door. But behind me was this old laundry chute, so I hopped in that and slid down that to the basement. When I got outside I saw that the whole top of the building was on fire and, of course, it was pandemonium with people running around and fire alarms ringing. So I decided to go home. When I get there my mother is having this big party so I creep up the back stairs to my room. Then there is this ring on the doorbell. It's the police. I creep over to the banister to see what they say, and they tell my mother that I had been killed in a fire at school. Well, everyone got very quiet.
HAROLD=>People were whispering and looking at my mother.
MAUDE=>Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life. They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in. Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can. Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I." Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!! Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
HAROLD=>I like you, Maude.
MAUDE=>I like you, Harold. Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
MRS. CHASEN=>This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
EDITH=>What kind of a car is it?
MRS. CHASEN=>It's a little MG roadster...
EDITH=>Oh. It looks like a hearse. Very nice. Compact.
MRS. CHASEN=>Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
EDITH=>Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
MRS. CHASEN=>Harold, I think you should go and wash up and meet us in the den. And remember what I said to you. Let's make Edith feel at home.
MRS. CHASEN=>And what do you do, my dear?
EDITH=>I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
MRS. CHASEN=>How interesting.
EDITH=>Not very.
MRS. CHASEN=>Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
EDITH=>I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
MRS. CHASEN=>Yes.
MRS. CHASEN=>Here's Harold now. No, don't get up.
MRS. CHASEN=>Edith was just telling me about her job.
EDITH=>I'm a file clerk.
MRS. CHASEN=>Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
EDITH=>Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
MRS. CHASEN=>She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
EDITH=>Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week... Fifteen hundred...
EDITH=>... bushels.
UNCLE VICTOR=>I'd put him in the Army, Helen.
HAROLD=>Look at that sky. It's so big.
MAUDE=>It's so blue.
HAROLD=>And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
MAUDE=>Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
HAROLD=>Maude, do you pray?
MAUDE=>Pray? No. I communicate.
HAROLD=>With God?
MAUDE=>With Life.
HAROLD=>This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
MAUDE=>Well, why don't you?
HAROLD=>No. I'd feel stupid.
MAUDE=>Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
HAROLD=>Want to join me in some cartwheels?
MAUDE=>No. I feel more like - yodeling.
HAROLD=>Yodeling?
MAUDE=>It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
HAROLD=>Where's that?
MAUDE=>From the guys who got the matches, of course.
HAROLD=>Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
MAUDE=>Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
HAROLD=>Shall I drop by tomorrow? Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
MAUDE=>Oh.
HAROLD=>I've never met her. My mother set it up.
MAUDE=>Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
MAUDE=>... is what the world sorely lacks. Oh, look!
MAUDE=>Dreyfus once wrote that on Devil's Island he would see the most glorious birds. Many years later in Britanny he realized they had only been sea gulls.
MAUDE=>To me they will always be - glorious birds.
MRS. CHASEN=>Harold, I cannot impress upon you too strongly the importance of this meeting. She is the last girl. The Computer Dating Company was reluctant to send anyone in view of what they've heard. Fortunately, I was able to demand they stand by their original agreement. But kindly remember this is your third and final chance.
MRS. CHASEN=>Here she is, now. Please try to take this seriously, if not for your sake, at least for hers.
MRS. CHASEN.=>Harold, I'd like you to meet eh, Sunshine Dore. Sunshine's an actress.
SUNSHINE=>I like to think so.
HAROLD=>How do you do?
SUNSHINE=>Can't complain.
MRS. CHASEN=>Well, I'll leave you two alone for a moment. I have to call my hairdresser. I'll bring back some drinks. Harold, perhaps Starlight would like a cigarette.
SUNSHINE=>Eh, Sunshine.
MRS. CHASEN.=>Oh, yes, of course.
HAROLD=>Would you like a cigarette?
SUNSHINE=>No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
HAROLD=>Is Sunshine your real name?
SUNSHINE=>Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
SUNSHINE=>Do you play?
HAROLD=>No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
SUNSHINE=>Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
SUNSHINE=>Oh, is this your father?
HAROLD=>No. My uncle.
SUNSHINE=>Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
SUNSHINE=>Oh, what a wonderful collection of knives. May I see them?
HAROLD=>Certainly.
HAROLD=>This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
SUNSHINE=>Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
HAROLD=>An ancient Japanese ceremony.
SUNSHINE=>Like a tea ceremony?
HAROLD=>No. Like this.
SUNSHINE=>Oh, that was marvelous, Harold. It had the ring of truth. Harold... Who did you study with? ... Oh, I'm sorry. I don't want to break into your private moment. I know how exhausting true emotion can be. I played Juliet at the Sunshine Playhouse. Louie thought it was my best performance.
SUNSHINE=>What's here? A cup, closed in my true love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. Oh churl! Drink all, and left no friendly drop to help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
SUNSHINE=>Happily some poison yet doth hang on them - to make me die with a restorative .
SUNSHINE=>Thy lips are warm!
SUNSHINE=>Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. Oh happy dagger!...
SUNSHINE=>... Oh happy dagger! This is thy sheath.
SUNSHINE=>There rest--
SUNSHINE=>- and let me die.
MRS. CHASEN=>Harold! That was your last date!
UNCLE VICTOR=>I'd put him in the Army, Helen.
MRS. CHASEN=>In view of your recent actions, Harold, I find you have left me with no recourse but to listen to the solution proposed by your uncle. Consequently, I have instructed him to take the necessary measures for you to be forthwith inducted into the service, and, for your own good, to take up active duty with the United States Army.
MRS. CHASEN=>I hope they will have more luck with you than I.
HAROLD=>Maude, I must speak to you.
MAUDE=>What is it, Harold?
HAROLD=>They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
MAUDE=>But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
HAROLD=>But they have.
MAUDE=>Well, don't go.
MAUDE=>Perhaps war is part of the human condition. But it shouldn't be encouraged. Bring over that wheelbarrow, will you please?
HAROLD=>But they'll put me in jail.
MAUDE=>Really. Just put it there, Harold.
MAUDE=>They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company. That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking? Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
HAROLD=>Maude, do you think you can help me?
MAUDE=>What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Harold, I want you to look at me like your father in this matter. We'll spend the day just getting to know each other. Now, I know that you have no great desire to join the Army. Hell, I felt the same way myself when I started out. But believe me, Harold, once you get to know it, you'll love it. It's a great life. Look at me. A chauffeur. Respect. Money in the bank. It has its drawbacks. Like anything else, I suppose. But the Army takes care of you. You join up, and you've got a buddy for life.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
HAROLD=>Thank you, Uncle.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
HAROLD=>Yes, sir.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
HAROLD=>Yes, sir.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
HAROLD=>During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
HAROLD=>War is not all black.
UNCLE VICTOR=>And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
HAROLD=>Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Well, Harold, I've always been a man who speaks his mind. It's hurt me. I'm not liked in Washington. I know that. But I do have friends in high places.
UNCLE VICTOR=>They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets. Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
HAROLD=>Jeez! That's a great story,
UNCLE VICTOR=>Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
HAROLD=>You think so, sir?
UNCLE VICTOR=>Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
HAROLD=>I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
UNCLE VICTOR=>It's the greatest excitement in the world.
HAROLD=>To pit your own life against another.
UNCLE VICTOR=>That's right.
HAROLD=>To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
UNCLE VICTOR=>The moment of truth.
HAROLD=>Another man's life in your sights.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Yes.
HAROLD=>ZAT!
HAROLD=>Will they really teach me to shoot?
UNCLE VICTOR=>Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
HAROLD=>And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
UNCLE VICTOR=>Oh sure.
HAROLD=>How about hand-to-hand combat?
UNCLE VICTOR=>Yes.
HAROLD=>To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Eh?
HAROLD=>How about to slit his throat?
UNCLE VICTOR=>Well, I don't...
HAROLD=>I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
HAROLD=>Sir, how about souvenirs?
UNCLE VICTOR=>Souvenirs?
HAROLD=>Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Harold!
HAROLD=>What's the chance of getting one of these?
HAROLD=>Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Harold! That's disgusting!
MAUDE'S VOICE=>It certainly is.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Who are you?
MAUDE=>I am petitioning for peace and I came over here to speak...
HAROLD=>Parasite!
UNCLE VICTOR=>Harold!
HAROLD=>Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
MAUDE=>Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate! Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
HAROLD=>Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
UNCLE VICTOR=>Harold, calm down! This is...
HAROLD=>She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
MAUDE=>Don't you advance on me.
HAROLD=>... of you. You'll all end up like this.
MAUDE=>Filth! Filth!
UNCLE VICTOR=>Lady, please. Harold...
HAROLD=>Just like this.
MAUDE=>Give me that. I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
HAROLD=>She took my head.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Stay where you are, Harold .
HAROLD=>She took my head.
MAUDE=>Keep away from me, you twisted pervert!
UNCLE VICTOR=>Lady, please. Give back the head and let's have no trouble.
HAROLD=>I'll kill her. I'll kill her.
HAROLD=>I lost my head.
HAROLD=>That wasn't very scary.
MAUDE=>No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
HAROLD=>Oh, you weren't scared.
MAUDE=>Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
HAROLD=>Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
HAROLD=>How about some candy floss?
MAUDE=>Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
HAROLD=>You sure have a way with people.
MAUDE=>Well, they're my species.
HAROLD=>Look at the stars.
MAUDE=>Yes. They're old friends.
HAROLD=>Do you think there is any life up there?
MAUDE=>I don't know. Perhaps.
HAROLD=>Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
MAUDE=>We are alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
HAROLD=>You should have been a poet.
MAUDE=>Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world. What a joke it will be if like them I -
MAUDE=>- end where I began.
HAROLD=>Maude.
MAUDE=>Yes.
HAROLD=>Here.
MAUDE=>Oh, a gift.
MAUDE=>"Harold loves Maude."
MAUDE=>And Maude loves Harold.
MAUDE=>Ohhhhh! This is the nicest present I've received in years.
MAUDE=>So I'll always know where it is.
MAUDE=>Come. Give me your arm. Let's go see the fireworks .
HAROLD=>Why are there no photographs in these frames?
MAUDE=>I took them out.
HAROLD=>Why?
MAUDE=>They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
HAROLD=>I'll never forget you, Maude. But I would like a photo of you.
MAUDE=>Well, let me see.
MAUDE=>I have something somewhere. Let me see.
MAUDE=>Oh, yes. Here. Take this.
MAUDE=>It's off my American visa.
HAROLD=>It looks like you. Thanks.
MAUDE=>Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
HAROLD=>You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
HAROLD=>Oh, you're not supposed to see that.
HAROLD=>It's part of a surprise I'm planning for tomorrow night. It's going to be really... Maude, you're crying.
MAUDE=>I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
HAROLD=>You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
MAUDE=>Oh, Harold. You are so young.
MAUDE=>What have they taught you? Yes. I cry. I cry for you. I cry for this. I cry at beauty - a first snow, a rose, a sunset.
MAUDE=>I cry when a man tortures his brother... when he repents and begs forgiveness... when forgiveness is refused... and when it is granted. To cry is to laugh. To laugh is to cry ... a uniquely human trait. And the main thing in life, my dear Harold, is not to be afraid to be human.
MRS. CHASEN=>Fay, darling, I know Rene will be furious but if you knew what I've had to put up with in the last couple of days...
HAROLD=>Mother.
MRS. CHASEN=>Not now, Harold... You can't put me down for Monday?
HAROLD=>Mother.
MRS. CHASEN=>Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
HAROLD=>Mother. I'm going to get married.
MRS. CHASEN=>Fay, I'll call you back. What did you say?
HAROLD=>I'm getting married.
MRS. CHASEN=>To whom?
HAROLD=>To a girl. Here.
MRS. CHASEN=>I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
HAROLD=>What?
MRS. CHASEN=>A sunflower?
MRS. CHASEN=>You can't be serious?
MRS. CHASEN=>He's serious.
UNCLE VICTOR=>Harold, your mother has spoken to me about your marriage plan, and though normally I have nothing against marriage, I don't think this is eh... quite normal. Now, I don't want to remind you of the unpleasant incident that occurred the other day. I think it is best if we consider that forgotten. But I do think that it would be wisest for you not to leave the house or indulge in any kind of activity that would be newsworthy. This marriage would attract attention, and, frankly Harold, I don't think you need a wife. You need a nurse.
PSYCHIATRIST=>There's no doubt, Harold, this impending marriage adds another chapter to an already fascinating case. But let us examine it, and I think you'll realize there is a simple Freudian explanation for your romantic attachment to this older woman. It is known as the Oedipus Complex, a very common neurosis, particularly in this society, whereby the male child subconsciously wishes to sleep with his mother.
PRIEST=>Now, Harold, the Church has nothing against the union of the old and the young. Each age has its own beauty. But a marital union is concerned with the conjugal rights. And the procreation of children. I would be remiss in my duties if I did not tell you that the idea of -- - intercourse - the fact of your young, firm -- -- body commingling with the withered flesh, sagging breasts, and flabby buttocks - makes me -- - want to vomit.
HAROLD.=>But you didn't ask if I love her.
MRS. CHASEN=>Love? Love? What do you know about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
HAROLD=>At a funeral.
MRS. CHASEN=>Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
HAROLD=>I don't care what people say.
MRS. CHASEN=>You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
MRS. CHASEN=>What are you doing, Harold? You can't leave me.
MRS. CHASEN=>Where are you going?
HAROLD=>I'm going to marry the woman I love.
MRS. CHASEN=>Harold!
MRS. CHASEN=>This is insane.
HAROLD=>Perhaps it is.
HAROLD=>I hope that isn't too tight. Okay. Here we go.
MAUDE=>Oh, I love surprises! Makes me feel so - chiffon!
MAUDE=>Oh, Harold, it is dazzling. They are all so... so beautiful!
HAROLD=>This way, m'lady.
HAROLD=>Supper for two.
MAUDE=>Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
HAROLD=>It's all right. It's organic.
MAUDE=>Oh, Harold.
HAROLD=>For you.
HAROLD=>And after dinner, one more surprise....
HAROLD=>... which I hope will make you very happy.
MAUDE=>Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
HAROLD=>Farewell?
MAUDE=>Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
HAROLD=>But you're not going anywhere, are you?
MAUDE=>Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
MAUDE=>Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is. So unnecessary.
HAROLD=>Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
MAUDE=>But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
HAROLD=>But why now?
MAUDE=>I thought eighty was a good round number.
MAUDE=>I feel giddy.
HAROLD=>But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
MAUDE=>Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
HAROLD=>It's true. I can't live without you.
MAUDE=>"And this too shall pass away."
HAROLD=>Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
MAUDE=>Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
HAROLD=>Hold on, Maude! Hold on! We'll be there soon. Please, just hold on.
MAUDE=>Hold on? Hold on? Oh, Harold, how absurd.
HAROLD=>Please. There's been an accident, an overdose of pills. We've got to see a doctor. It's an emergency.
HEAD NURSE=>All right, now go ahead and get the particulars.
STUDENT NURSE=>Eh, what's your name?
HAROLD=>It's not me. It's her.
HEAD NURSE=>It's better to begin by asking last name first, then first name, then middle name or initial, if any. It saves time.
STUDENT NURSE=>What is your last name?
MAUDE=>Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
HAROLD=>Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
HEAD NURSE=>Young man, perhaps you ought to wait in the waiting room.
STUDENT NURSE=>How old are you?
MAUDE=>Eighty. It's my birthday.
STUDENT NURSE=>Oh, many happy returns.
MAUDE=>No. I don't think so.
HAROLD=>You don't understand. She's taken an overdose of pills two hours ago. She hasn't got much time.
INTERN=>Could I have your signature on this? It's just a formality.
MAUDE=>Delighted! I like your hair so much.
INTERN=>It's in case of damage claims, you know, so we - the hospital - won't be responsible for...
HEAD NURSE=>Always use a ballpoint pen. It's more efficient.
HAROLD=>Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
MAUDE=>Well, not dying, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
INTERN=>Not that anything regrettable is going to happen. It's just regulations .
HEAD NURSE=>Well, then, perhaps you'd better skip the preliminaries and get to the important section.
STUDENT NURSE=>All right. Ah, what is your Social Security number?
INTERN=>Purely a legal safeguard. Nothing personal, you understand.
HEAD NURSE=>No. Ask about the insurance. The hospital insurance.
STUDENT NURSE=>Do you have any insurance? Blue Cross? Blue Shield?
MAUDE=>Insurance against what?
STUDENT NURSE=>No insurance.
HAROLD=>This is madness.
HEAD NURSE=>I'm sorry but there is always a two-hour wait for the psychiatrist.
INTERN=>It's nothing personal. It's my job.
DOCTOR=>What's the trouble?
HEAD NURSE=>An overdose of drugs .
STUDENT NURSE=>Do you have a welfare plan at your place of employment?
MAUDE=>I'm retired.
HAROLD=>Doctor, please. She has taken these pills. You've got to do something .
DOCTOR=>All right. Take her in there.
INTERN=>It's nothing personal.
STUDENT NURSE=>And who's the next of kin?
MAUDE=>Humanity...
MAUDE=>Farewell, Harold. It's been all such fun.
