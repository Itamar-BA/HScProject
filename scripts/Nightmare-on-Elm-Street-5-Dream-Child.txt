ALICE=>I'm going to take a shower.
ALICE=>Oh great. The drain monster strikes again.
ALICE=>No...WAIT!
ALICE=>Jesus...
VOICE=>What's the matter hon? Bad dream?
ENGLUND=>There's no such thing as safe sex.
DAN=>...we stand naked and defenseless before an ever more unimaginable horror
DAN=>...college. High school was only the beginning for some of us. Don't forget: S.A.T. stands for Sadistic, Anti-human, Torture.
RACINE GIBSON=>How colorful. Who is he?
GRETA=>Dan Jordan. Captain of our football team.
RACINE GIBSON=>Charming...
GRETA=>Alice! Yvonne!
YVONNE=>Hey, girl!
ALL THREE=>Yvonne!
YVONNE=>C'mon, honey!
ALICE=>I'm the A-L-I-C-E. Blond hair on my head, blue eyes to see.
ALL THREE=>Greta!
GREAT=>The G-R-E-T-A and my mom says I'll be in magazines one day!
ALL THREE=>We're the three together, and together we'll be. The Y, the A, don't forget the G!
YVONNE=>Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
ALICE=>Had kind of a long night.
YVONNE=>Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
ALICE=>No, the Dan part was nice...
GRETA=>These things are wild... What do you think?
YVONNE=>Makes you look like a nun--
ALICE=>Yeah - kick the habit! Break those vows!
GRETA=>Find me a man!
MARK=>No, it's all wrong. Sell it! More teeth and raise the arms a bit.
GRETA=>Maybe I should spell it for you.
ALICE=>Maybe God's trying to tell you something.
MARK=>Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
GRETA=>Next life. Oh, what's that?
MARK=>My undying love. Have some.
ALICE=>Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
MARK=>I think I'm starting to wear her down. Have some anyway.
GRETA=>That must never pass these lips.
RACINE GIBSON=>Greta, that's not what a cover girl puts in her body.
MARK=>Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!
GRETA=>Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
ALICE=>Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
MARK=>Greta, come on. One burger with me?
GRETA=>One with you and I'm off to comic book land. We're high school graduates now. Time to grow up.
MR. GREY=>Hey Rembrandt!. No wonder I couldn't find you. I thought you'd be hanging out with the guys.
MARK=>Oh, hi, Dad. I thought the guys could hang out with themselves.
ALICE=>Did you bring your sketchbook to the ceremony. I'd love to see what you did to D.W.
MR. GREY=>Who?
GRETA=>D.W. Yates. The Principal.
MARK=>Uh, Dickweed, sir.
MR. GREY=>Uh huh... I hope you had time to finish those cross-sections I asked for.
MARK=>Can we get into that later, Dad?
ALICE=>Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.
YVONNE=>Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
DAN=>Hi, beautiful.
ALICE=>Jesus! Don't do that!
DAN=>Sorry, babe.
ALICE=>Me too. Give me a kiss.
DAN=>Got a present for you.
ALICE=>The tickets.
DAN=>They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris. It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
ALICE=>I know.
DAN=>Okay, babe. What's the matter?
ALICE=>Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
DAN=>He'll show up. C'mon, what's really wrong?
ALICE=>I had one of those dreams last night.
DAN=>About him?
ALICE=>No. Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control. For the first time since...all that. I'm scared.
DAN=>You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.
ALICE=>Yeah...I guess.
DAN=>You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
ALICE=>You're right.
DAN=>There you go. Love you.
ALICE=>Me too.
MR. JORDAN=>Dan, this is Coach Ostrow...
OSTROW=>So I've hear.
DAN=>Dad, summer's just starting --
MR. JORDAN=>We're talking about your future.
MRS. JORDAN=>Excuse us, dear.
ALICE=>It's okay, Dan
MARK=>That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
GRETA=>You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
ALICE=>My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
MARK=>Well we gotta do something!
YVONNE=>All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do. I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
GRETA=>Yeah...
YVONNE=>That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
MARK=>Pool party! I dig it! Babes in wet T- shirts. No -- topless! Fucking heaven!
ALICE=>The Y, the A...
MARK=>What'd I say?
ALICE=>Oh, damn! I have to work tonight.
GRETA=>Tell Dan to bring you after. C'mon, let's get you mopped up.
MR. GREY=>Mark! Picture time. Come get immortalized. Parents and brats.
RACINE GIBSON=>Greta! Photo opportunity, dear!
GRETA=>Damn. They caught me, too. Guess I'd better go gnash my thousand-dollar teeth for the paparazzi.
ALICE=>you guys go ahead. I'll catch up with you later.
VOICE=>You do look beautiful.
ALICE=>I was afraid you weren't coming.
ALICE'S DAD=>I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
ALICE=>That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
ALICE'S DAD=>No. A deal's a deal.
ALICE=>Dad!
ALICE'S DAD=>It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
ALICE=>I don't give a damn what they might think. You're terrific.
ALICE'S DAD=>Where are we going?
ALICE=>To take a picture.
DAN=>Call me when your shift ends.
ALICE=>Thanks for everything, Dad.
ALICE'S DAD=>You sure you don't want a ride to work?
ALICE=>It's just across the park.
ALICE'S DAD=>Okay, angel. Have fun tonight.
ALICE=>No. This isn't going to happen.
VOICES=>Nine ten, Freddy's back again...
ALICE=>Wait!
DOCTOR=>There's nothing to be afraid of. Just do exactly what I say.
ALICE=>No!!!!!
AMANDA=>Help me...why is this happening again? Please! Don't let him do this...
DOCTOR=>Don't panic, sister. We've got a breach birth here. It's backwards. I'm going to have to turn it around. Okay. Deep breath. Here we go. I need you to push...now! Push!
NUN=>This is still one of God's creatures, you know. Take solace in that.
AMANDA=>That is no creature of God!
ALICE=>You can't make me bring you BACK!
FREDDY=>It's a boy.
ALICE=>You can't come back! I locked the door on you!
FREDDY=>But I found the key!
AMANDA=>Your birth was a curse on humanity. But the more evil that was in me is no more. I will not allow this to happen again.
ALICE=>Home? How? Where?
AMANDA=>Rid yourself of...
ALICE=>No!
VOICE=>Alice! Where've you been?
ALICE=>Anne! Oh god, I'm glad it's you. It was terrible.
ANNE=>You're hours late.
ALICE=>Hours? Last thing I remember was crossing the park...
ANNE=>The party'll be history by the time I get there... Great!
ALICE=>...what?
ANNE=>I said thanks a lot, Alice. For nada!
GRETA=>So what did your dad say about you and Alice going to Europe?
DAN=>Not much. He mostly screamed. Thinks I'm throwing my life away.
YVONNE=>Who's throwing their life away?
MARK=>Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.
YVONNE=>Two hours a day, six days a week.
GRETA=>Have another one, sounds like you need it.
YVONNE=>Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
GRETA=>Nah. It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair. She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
DAN=>Don't you ever get tired of your mom trying to run your life?
YVONNE=>Don't let 'em.
DAN=>Sure, no problem.
MARK=>He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
GRETA=>Who?
MARK=>Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
GRETA=>You're weird, you know that?
MARK=>Screw 'em. Open the champagne. Let's have a party.
DAN=>Hands off squirrel. That's for me and Alice...for later.
MARK=>Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that.
GRETA=>I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
DAN=>Just a little blood, guy.
MARK=>Red ink I can handle by the bucket load. The real stuff makes me... you know.
YVONNE=>Vomit?
MARK=>Faint.
GRETA=>You can look now, it's safe.
JOCK=>Yo, Dan. Telephone.
DAN=>I'll be right back -- and don't mess with the bottle.
GRETA=>We'll guard it with our lives.
ALICE=>It was him. I was awake when it happened. Do you understand what I'm saying? He must have dreamt himself up...Jesus, Dan...I'm scared.
YVONNE=>Somebody die?
DAN=>Nah. I just gotta go.
MARK=>Alice beckons.
D.J.=>Right, lady...and Elvis killed Marilyn 'cause the Kennedy's put fluoride in his water. WHAT'S THE MATTER, LADY...DID YOU GO OFF YOUR MEDICATION?!
MRS. JORDAN=>I'm calling about my wayward ex-son Daniel, who has just acted like on ungrateful, unmanageable Dickweed, ever since he was seduced by this bimbo, slut- whore, Alice...
DAN=>Mom...?
FREDDY=>If I were you lady, I'd kill the ungrateful piggy!
DAN=>Alice!....
FREDDY=>Time to feel the need for speed, Dickweed!
DAN=>AAAALICE!!!!
FREDDY=>Don't dream and drive!
ALICE=>Dan...
TRUCK DRIVER=>He came flying out of nowhere! Like he was a fucking rocket! I didn't even see him...
DAN=>It was him!
ALICE=>It was him.
YVONNE=>You're alright...It's okay, honey. I'm right here.
ALICE=>It was no accident. It was Krueger. He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore. He's found some other way.
YVONNE=>Alice, it's no dream. I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
ALICE'S DAD=>I'm so sorry, honey...
ALICE=>Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back. Make them understand.
YVONNE=>Calm down. Take it easy. You're hitting shock.
ALICE'S DAD=>Alice. The police found fragments of a champagne bottle...
ALICE=>Dan didn't drink. You know that. It was probably for me - to celebrate our trip.
DR. MOORE=>These sorts of outbursts aren't entirely uncommon. Many women have them in the first few weeks. Especially if they've suffered a traumatic shock. But don't worry young lady, you're going to be fine.
ALICE=>I won't be fine and neither will any of my friends. We've got to do something. Dan's already dead...Don't you see? He's back and he's just getting started. What do you mean? What's he talking about? What's wrong with me?
YVONNE=>Nothing.
ALICE'S DAD=>The doctor wants to keep you here overnight...
DR. MOORE=>Just for routine observation. To make sure you're as comfortable as possible.
ALICE=>Dan's baby...
JACOB=>Hey...wake up.
ALICE=>Huh?
JACOB=>My name is Jacob.
ALICE=>Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
JACOB=>It's lonely in there, in my room.
ALICE=>My name is...
JACOB=>I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
ALICE=>How did you know that?
JACOB=>I could tell you were sad. I just wanted to see if you were all right.
ALICE=>Jacob. Wait. Don't go.
ALICE=>Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
YVONNE=>There aren't any little boys on your floor.
ALICE=>He must've wandered up from the children's ward. I just wondered what was wrong with him.
YVONNE=>We don't have a children's ward.
ALICE=>But he was wearing a hospital robe.
YVONNE=>I don't know what to tell you.
ALICE=>Did everyone call everyone?
YVONNE=>They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
ALICE=>Amanda Krueger was a part of a religious order that ran that asylum. She was raped and had the baby there in the 1940's. That baby grew up to be Freddy Krueger who murdered twenty or thirty kids right here on Elm Street.
MARK=>Cover girls couldn't smoke.
ALICE=>But that was just the beginning. He keeps on killing...only now he kills people in their dreams, their nightmares. And he uses my dreams to get to his victims.
MARK=>I've got to write some of this down.
ALICE=>That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
YVONNE=>Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
GRETA=>I want to talk about the baby.
MARK=>Yeah, congratulations...I guess.
ALICE=>That's not what we're here for!
YVONNE=>Look. Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard. He was bitching about it at the party last night. He was under pressure. We all are.
GRETA=>Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
ALICE=>What's that got to do with it?
YVONNE=>When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.
ALICE=>Than he must have found another way.
GRETA=>Christ, Mark! Mister compassion.
ALICE=>Listen! This isn't a goddamn joke! He gets in through my dreams -- somehow. I thought I could control it, but something's changed, and I don't know what he'll do next.
MARK=>Look, we all liked Dan. And we love you...
GRETA=>Bottom line, Alice. Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
YVONNE=>All of us. Right?
ALICE=>That's what I'm afraid of.
ALICE=>How was the meeting?
ALICE'S DAD=>Sobering...
ALICE=>Very funny.
ALICE'S DAD=>Alice...
ALICE=>Since when are you such a smart shopper?
ALICE'S DAD=>Since my little girl became a mom...
ALICE=>You disappointed in me?
ALICE'S DAD=>No, I'm not. I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
ALICE=>C'mon. Let's do salad.
MRS. GIBSON=>Greta...
GRETA=>Flash 'em your boobs. The sight of all that plastic ought to stun 'em for a while. Coming Mother!
MRS. GIBSON=>It's true, people are always mistaking us for sisters.
GUEST=>Greta certainly has the perfect body for modeling. You know, Eileen Ford's a friend of mine. I told her about you. She's very interested
MRS. GIBSON=>Greta, you're being offered the chance of a lifetime! I think you should show a little gratitude.
GRETA=>One of my friends died yesterday, mother. DO you mind if I take a few hours off to remember him?
MRS. GIBSON=>But we're having a party, dear.
TRENDY GUEST=>I read about him. Drunk or something, wasn't he?
MRS. GIBSON=>He was just a friend of Greta's, not someone special, not someone she was seeing, you understand. Really just an acquaintance...
THIRTYSOMETHING GUEST=>Sad. It reminds me of Fitzgerald. Although in his stories, it's general the women who have pointless, violent deaths.
GRETA=>No thank you. I'm not hungry.
MRS. GIBSON=>Aren't you eating?
GRETA=>I don't really feel up to it.
MRS. GIBSON=>Really, dear. You ought to try something.
GRETA=>You're the one who's always slapping my hand about weight-watching.
MRS. GIBSON=>But that's why we diet, dear. So we can eat at social events and not upset the other guests.
FREDERICK=>Madam, if I may...
FREDDY=>You are what you eat.
MRS. GIBSON=>Nothing but the best for Greta!
FREDDY=>Second helping.
MRS. GIBSON=>Don't talk with your mouth full, dear.
FREDDY=>Don't forget dessert.
GUEST=>A rare delicacy.
ALICE=>Greta!
GRETA'S MOTHER=>Greta?...
ALICE=>Mr. Grey...is Mark around?
MR. GREY=>Back there somewhere.
ALICE=>Mark, are you okay?
MARK=>Yeah. I'm just aces.
ALICE=>I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And...
MARK=>I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
YVONNE=>It was just an accident. Like with Dan.
ALICE=>No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
YVONNE=>Please, Alice...
MARK=>I thought about that.
ALICE=>She must've fallen asleep at the table...
YVONNE=>Stop it, Alice. Just stop it. Stick to the facts.
MARK=>Too bad.
ALICE=>I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
YVONNE=>Why don't you two stick to reality.
MARK=>Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
YVONNE=>Mark...
MARK=>I'm not finished - I loved Greta. A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
YVONNE=>I can't listen to this.
MARK=>Then get out!
ALICE=>Mark!
MARK=>Aww,shit...Yvonne, wait a minute, will ya.
YVONNE=>It's okay.
MARK=>Stick around, please?
YVONNE=>Wish I could, but I'm on night shift again...gotta go.
ALICE=>I can stay for awhile if you want.
MARK=>Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
ALICE=>Nobody thinks that.
MARK=>I mean, I know I didn't stand a chance in hell, but...
ALICE=>She cared a lot about you.
MARK=>Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
ALICE=>It wasn't her mother. The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
MARK=>Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
ALICE=>Why don't I go make some coffee. There's a lot to tell.
ALICE=>Mark?...
ALICE=>Take it!
JACOB=>Oh...hello...
ALICE=>Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
JACOB=>Been having bad dreams.
ALICE=>Is this where you live, Jacob?
JACOB=>Just waiting for someone... It's sad about Greta.
ALICE=>Is that who you're waiting for?
JACOB=>No...
ALICE=>I don't think this is a nice place for you to be. Maybe we should go find your Mom.
JACOB=>She doesn't want me around
ALICE=>Oh...I'm sure that's not true. I'll bet she's very worried about you. I would be.
JACOB=>No you're not. You don't even care about being a mom. How come you don't think about me?
ALICE=>Who said I...wait, what?
JACOB=>I like you...I want to stay with you. Why don't you want me? Is there something wrong with me?
ALICE=>Who says I don't like you?
JACOB=>My friend, with the funny hand.
ALICE=>Come on, honey. We're getting out of here.
JACOB=>I have to go now, he wants me again.
ALICE=>No! Jacob!...
MARK=>Holy...shit...he's really real...isn't he?
ALICE=>He's doing something to my baby. I know it -- he's trying to hurt Jacob.
MARK=>Who's Jacob?
ALICE=>My baby!
MARK=>What, you named it already?
ALICE=>Yeah. I think he already has a name...
MARK=>Whoa, slow down. How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
ALICE=>I don't know!
MARK=>Look, if you're worried about your baby, call Yvonne, have the doctor check him out.
ALICE=>Where are you going?
MARK=>I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
YVONNE=>You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
ALICE=>I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
YVONNE=>Oh, Alice...no. Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
ALICE=>Mark knows I'm not crazy. Ask him to show you his hands.
YVONNE=>I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
ALICE=>I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
YVONNE=>Yeah...they do, but...do us both a favor...don't mention any of this to Dr. Moore.
DR. MOORE=>Developing fetuses can spend up to seventy-percent of their day in what we call dream state. More as they mature.
ALICE=>Would I be able to sense them?
DR. MOORE=>Is that why you're here? To see if your baby's having nightmares?
ALICE=>We're here to find out everything we can, aren't we?
DR. MOORE=>Frankly, I've found nothing about you that would indicate the necessity of ultra-sound at this stage of your pregnancy.
ALICE=>I just want to make sure my baby's all right.
DR. MOORE=>The heart seems strong. Let's hear it.
FREDDY=>Hi. See a family resemblance?
ALICE=>Don't touch him!
ALICE=>What's he doing to my baby?
DR. MOORE=>Your baby is perfectly healthy... a little large for so early on, but as normal as any I've seen.
ALICE=>He's taking their souls...Their spirits to make the baby...like him.
YVONNE=>Come on, sweety. I'll take you home. You'll feel better after you get some real sleep.
ALICE=>...Dan was there. Greta, too. Krueger killed them! And now he's feeding them to Jacob!
YVONNE=>Alice...
ALICE=>Completely insane. But I'm not And if you're my friend you'll try to believe me a little.
YVONNE=>I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you. But, you're like a locked safe. You've gotta start dealing with reality.
ALICE=>Krueger is reality.
YVONNE=>And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
ALICE=>What do you think I'm doing? Look. Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back. He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
YVONNE=>All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman. Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
ALICE=>Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams.
MARK=>He sure found a few others before us.
YVONNE=>You, too?
MARK=>He invited me to his house last night.
YVONNE=>Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
ALICE=>That's the only reason you're alive...
YVONNE=>No it's not!
MARK=>Yvonne, look through this stuff. She's not crazy!
ALICE=>I found out how Krueger's been doing it while I'm awake. He's using Jacob's dreams. We've got to stop him.
MARK=>You know there is...one way.
ALICE=>I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
MARK=>Then we'll find another way.
ALICE=>I've seen her...
ALICE'S DAD=>Alice, can you come down a minute?
ALICE=>Oh, hi...
MRS. JORDAN=>Alice...Mr. Jordan and I wanted to see how you were feeling. Come, sit down.
ALICE'S DAD=>This isn't really a good time. Maybe if you could come back...
MRS. JORDAN=>Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
ALICE=>What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.
MR. JORDAN=>We're concerned that this all might be a little too much for you...I mean, being single and, well everything...
MRS. JORDAN=>What Mr. Jordan means is that we're aware of the burden that raising a child would place you.
ALICE=>Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.
MRS. JORDAN=>And ours. It's our grandchild.
MR. JORDAN=>Doris, maybe this wasn't such a good --
MRS. JORDAN=>In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
ALICE=>What are you talking about? My "condition"?...
MR. JORDAN=>We had a call from Dr. Moore. He said Alice was hysterical. That she's been having paranoid delusions and...
ALICE=>You don't understand...
MRS. JORDAN=>We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
ALICE=>You're not taking my baby!
MRS. JORDAN=>The courts may not agree with you.
ALICE'S DAD=>But I do. I've heard enough of this crap. You think you can just walk into my house and start threatening my daughter?
ALICE=>They think I'm nuts.
MARK=>That's their problem.
ALICE=>No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob. You said she committed suicide?
MARK=>That's what the newspapers thought. She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
ALICE=>Meaning?
MARK=>They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
ALICE=>But I've seen her grave.
MARK=>Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
ALICE=>Poor woman...
MARK=>No shit.
ALICE=>I don't understand.
MARK=>She killed herself. Her soul's gonna be in torment.
ALICE=>Where'd you hear that?
MARK=>In here...somewhere.
ALICE=>In the dream...she was trying to stop him...she started to tell me how, then the door slammed. He must have done it.
MARK=>No problem...what are you going to do?
ALICE=>I'm going to find out how to deal with this guy for once and for all.
ALICE=>Amanda! I need to talk to you!
FREDDY=>Where you goin', piglet?
ALICE=>Found you!
FREDDY=>Where you goin', piglet? The party's just starting.
ALICE=>I know exactly what you're up to, Krueger!
FREDDY=>Gee, Alice, I thought I was up to...Yvonne!
ALICE=>Let her go.
FREDDY=>Going once. Going twice.
ALICE=>I'm the A, the L , the i,c,e. We're three together...
ALICE AND YVONNE=>And that's the way it's gonna be!
ALICE=>Are you alright?
YVONNE=>Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.
ALICE=>We've got to find Amanda. She's the key.
MARK=>You shitty son of a bitch!
FREDDY=>Time to cut another character out of the story!
GRETA=>Mark...help me...!
FREDDY=>Is she delicious or am I crazy? Try a bite.
MARK=>No!
FREDDY=>Faster than a bastard maniac!
ALICE=>In the dream, she was standing in a room.
YVONNE=>You think that's the place she's buried?
ALICE=>If they actually bothered to bury her.
COP=>Nothing in the room was up to code. It's a miracle you both weren't killed.
ALICE=>No, he won't hurt me. He needs me alive.
COP=>Who?
ALICE=>Yvonne!
YVONNE=>What?
ALICE=>Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
YVONNE=>But how are we gonna --
ALICE=>We've got to go to the asylum and find her body. Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me. It must be!
ALICE'S DAD=>Alice!
ALICE=>I've got to go.
ALICE'S DAD=>No! I won't have you running around in the middle of the night. You're coming home.
ALICE=>But Dad --
ALICE'S DAD=>Now.
ALICE=>Find Amanda. And hurry.
ALICE'S DAD=>Now I want you to go upstairs and get some sleep.
ALICE=>You're right. That's exactly what I need to do.
ALICE'S DAD=>It is...
ALICE=>Come on out, Krueger! The game's over. I know what you're up to.
ALICE=>Come on you fucking coward!
JACOB=>Mommy, meet my friend...
FREDDY=>Just what I really needed. Thank you. It's a whole new me. Like it?
JACOB=>Mommy...?
ALICE=>Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
FREDDY=>I've got you both.
ALICE=>Come on, Jacob. Time to go home.
VOICE=>Jacob...
ALICE=>Dan?...
DAN=>It's all right, Jacob... Come to Daddy.
ALICE=>He's not your father!
FREDDY=>Kids! Always a disappointment.
ALICE=>Where is he?
JACOB=>He's inside you, where he hides.
ALICE=>What do you mean?
JACOB=>It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.
ALICE=>But how...?
JACOB=>He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.
ALICE=>All right, Krueger. This time it's for keeps.
FREDDY=>Come on, Alice. Now we can really get to know each other.
ALICE=>NO!!!
ALICE=>Get out! Get out!!
AMANDA=>Jacob! Alice will not triumph.
JACOB=>Hey! Leave her. She's no fun anymore. I want to go home now.
AMANDA=>Now, Jacob! Unleash the power he has given you!
JACOB=>Fuck you, Krueger
