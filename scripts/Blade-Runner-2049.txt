A GREEN EYE=>We move towards its pupil. EXT. SKIES OVER GROUND. DAY.
SOARING OVER=>AN INFINITE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE OF SOLAR PANELS AND PLASTIC SHEETING. All dead and abandoned to the dust and wind. Finally giving way to -- EXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA. DAY. Called farm only generously. The ground dry, inhospitable. A dubious horizon to distinguish the browns that are both Earth and sky. There is no green in sight. The landscape streaks by in a blur. Nothing to tame our focus until... REVEAL:
A SPINNER=>Beaten, scuffed, yet owns the sky like a seagull. It flits RIGHT BY US, as we MOVE INSIDE -- INT. SPINNER. THE PILOT IS ASLEEP. The Spinner on autopilot. The MAP on the dash is abruptly interrupted by A CHIME. The pilot wakes. Yawns. This is K. You’d peg him for 30 if you didn’t know better. Refined features, flawless skin. Intelligent eyes that breathe in detail and exhale warmth. Gifted with a grin that masks wry for earnest. SHAPES begin to coalesce ahead in the distance. Revealing themselves to be PLASTIC GREENHOUSES. K’s eyes go hard at seeing a strange INSTALLATION ahead. K directs the Spinner towards... EXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA. DAY. TRAVELLING WITH THE SPINNER over remains of abandoned greenhouses. PLASTIC DOMES over what were once POOLS. A windmill stands above it all. Slowly, creakily rotating. Its bent wing hitting the center pole as it strikes 6 o’clock... creakCLACK... creakCLACK... creakCLACK...
THE SPINNER SOARS OVERHEAD.=>The Farmer sets down his rake. EXT. FARMHOUSE. The Spinner lands in the open field behind the house, kicking up a PLUME of DUST that briefly obscures it. A small flitty HOVERCRAFT ejects itself from the back of the Spinner, A PILOTFISH. K emerges from the dust. Whatever color his coat was, it’s brown now. K instructs with the Pilotfish with a gesture. It
TAKES OFF.=>K approaches the peeling-paint farmhouse. ONE TREE in sight, a giant, DEAD, leafless thing. A ghost of grandiosity, standing only thanks to a brace and wires staked down. INT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER. K crosses creaking floors. Looks around: Kalsomined walls, pitted windows. All old, but clean. Someone takes pride. Basic furniture, an UPRIGHT PIANO. Otherwise EMPTY. No decor, shelves BARE. K inspects the few items. Sheet music for CHOPIN on the piano. An aquarium in which COWSLIPS grow... A pot of something fragrant simmers on the stove... K leans into the pot, sniffs deeply, when -- HEAVY FOOTSTEPS come from outside. Rattling the whole house. K re-lids the pot, as --
THE GUN THUNDERS.=>HOLD ON THE GUN. So we only HEAR Sapper’s body DROP. K breathes heavy. Checks his wound. Sees his BLOOD on his
FINGERS.=>Blood trickles onto fallen sheet music. Staining Chopin. K smooths himself back to dignity. Leans over the body. Then PAUSES. Crosses the room. Finds a spoon. Hesitates. Tastes the soup. Hmmm. Garlic. EXT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER. K steps out. Looks up at a sliver of sun eking through the dense clouds. The Pilotfish is hovering above the farm. In one hand he holds SAPPER’S GLASSES. In the other he holds a small, clear CASE. INSIDE IS SAPPER’S EYE. He staggers toward his Spinner. Gestures to the Pilotfish.
SOARING OVER=>The breathtaking cityscape skyline of dystopian grime. 30 years older. Sweatier. Sucked of oxygen. If LA then was a giant oil refinery then, now it is industrial bones jutting out of a new city built atop the old. And spread far as the eye can see. What were streets are canyons that cut deep down to the strata below. Who knows how far.
K’S SPINNER=>Is a single bulb in the Christmas tree. Part of the SPINNER TRAFFIC that lights up the sky. Now gliding for the city’s poorer, uglier center. A seizure of ADVERTISEMENT, interactive and bright. In the distance is a massive structure: THE SEPULVEDA SEAWALL.
SKINNER.”=>EXT. K’S APARTMENT. NIGHT. PUSH IN ON K’S WINDOW, as a LIGHT turns on within... INT. K’S APARTMENT. A sparsely adorned space in clear contrast to his neighbors. No pretense of cultural heritage. A simple chair. On its arm a valueless paperback novel, well-thumbed, noted, creased. Nabokov’s maddening “PALE FIRE” as it happens, not that we make a thing of it. K walks in with his package, trying to be discreet, he hides it as... He turns on a CONSOLE. Perhaps a MUSIC PLAYER, which spins a SINATRA song, “Summer Winds.” K takes off his coat. Seems more annoyed at the scalpel tear in the fabric than the shoulder wound he sustained under it.
JOI=>How was your meeting?
REVEAL: JOI.=>Not a real woman at all. A digital companion. PROJECTED from a hard line CONSOLE unit mounted on tracks along the ceiling, and restricting her existence to this space. Goddess, girlfriend, geisha and, right now, goddamn bombshell. Ingeniously real in every way except the one that counts. She holds a plate of steak frites. Not real of course. An illusion of satisfaction. Just like Joi in her APRON over a sweater set and pearls. Waiting for him with dinner on the table and drink in hand like a cartoon 60s housewife.
JOI=>An emanator.
APPEARS ON THE MONITOR.=>ON HIS MONITOR: AUTOCAPTURING THE SERIAL NUMBER. This as --
AN EYE=>LARGE. LOVELY. A rich green we so far haven’t seen in the film. AN OLD VOIGHT-KAMPFF RECORDING. The eye BLINKS. Over it comes a JUMBLE OF VOICES, falling in and out, incomplete audio. YET ALL HAUNTINGLY FAMILIAR. ON K. WATCHING, AS -- Have a little boy--butterfly collection plus the killing-- --Feel a wasp crawling on your wrist--
A BABY’S SOCK=>EXT. FARMHOUSE. DAWN. K stands in front of the farmhouse, by the tree. Sees a SINGLE NEMATODE crawling along the cold dirt. Picks it up. Watches it wriggle. He sets it down to continue its journey. “It only takes the one.” K sees something carved on one of the tree’s roots, hidden by dirt and sand. REVEAL: A DATE: CARVED ON THE ROOT. Like a grave marker. 6/10/21 ANGLE OVER THE TREE LOOKING DOWN AT K. Kneeling beside it. ON K. Stricken by what he sees. He traces the date with his finger. As if to prove it’s real -- stands suddenly. K moves determinedly towards his Spinner, at which we REVEAL: THE FARMHOUSE IS ON FIRE. BURNING TO THE GROUND.
LUV=>Not yet, Sir.
NIANDER WALLACE=>Shadow shrouded. Commanding in his silences, which are few. Older, yet at the height of powers that still increase as if by magic. Only when he steps into the LIGHT do we see -- WALLACE IS BLIND. The probes act as his eyes.
WAKES. AN INCEPT.=>A first breath. Consciousness coming on anew. A first flutter of the eyes. A slow realization of light. Of cold. OF WALLACE STARING AT HER. Wallace’s hand touches her face. Turns it. Caresses it. “Seeing” her with his fingers. The Replicant Model bristles in mute terror of a world she cannot understand. Shivering. Cold and fear commingled.
A BLADE.=>Luv holds back. Knows better than to help without asked as he begins his examination.
LUV=>She crosses the chaotic hall unnoticed, determined. She will not disappoint. INT. CORONER’S OFFICE. HALLWAY. DAY. WITH COCO: Entering... INT. MORGUE. DAY. He finds LUV casually packing the BONES back into a satchel. Confused by her calm.
OF DNA FINGERPRINTING.=>The LETTERS flow like millions of snowflakes. Intense, numbing, seizure inducing, incomprehensible. The information flickers across K’s face. His concentration holds. Taking it all in. Missing nothing.
BOOM! THE SPINNER LURCHES.=>K looks back, sees -- A LONG METAL BOLT has punctured a rear quarterpanel -- A SHOT FIRED FROM THE MESA -- where --
TRAILS A LONG MICRO-FILAMENT...=>That sprouts a KITE. That RISES... UP... INTO THE CLOUDS... Where A HUGE STATIC CHARGE BUILDS in a RUMBLE overhead...
LIGHTNING FIRES!=>A MASSIVE ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE RUNS DOWN THE FILAMENT -- AND
STRIKES THE SPINNER!=>EXT. TRASH MESA. THE SPINNER STALLS. ENGINES FAILING. INT. K’S SPINNER. DAY. POWER goes out inside, just as --
JOI FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS.=>K sees SMOKE coming off the engine, slaps an emergency system to activate it, as -- THE SPINNER’S NOSE DROPS. BEGINS TO SPIRAL DOWN! K tries to control the crash. Steering with one hand, working the controls furiously with the other. The GROUND closing in -- K REACHES TO GRAB THE EMANATOR AS IT SLIDES OVER THE PASSENGER SEAT -- he clutches it tight -- ROCKETS FIRE UNDER THE SPINNER TO DAMPEN THE IMPACT AS -- EXT. TRASH MESA. THE SPINNER CRASHES INTO A VALLEY OF TRASH! POV FROM A MESA: The rain stops. The Spinner smokes. K IS INSIDE. Unconscious. Unmoving. Forehead BLOODY. INT. K’S SPINNER. ON THE EMANATOR, fallen at K’s feet. Its LIGHT blinks ON. JOI PROJECTS. Looks about her.
MORE.=>K points his blaster from one Scavenger to the next. They begin to back away -- until K sees -- FIFTY MORE SCAVENGERS CREST THE HILL OF TRASH. COMING TO
JOIN THE FIGHT.=>K IS CORNERED. HE FIRES TWICE. TWO SCAVENGERS DROP. But still they keep coming. K backs up toward his Spinner. ON K. His next move uncertain, critical, when --
BOOOM!=>ROCKETS FALL FROM THE SKY RIGHT INTO THE MASS OF SCAVENGERS. A BRUTAL DRONE STRIKE, INSTANTLY OBLITERATING THEM. K is thrown back into his Spinner. A final ROCKET POUNDS the few surviving Scavengers before they can scatter. K looks up to the sky. Sees a distant blinking LIGHT, like a satellite, hidden far away in the clouds, and --
SHE FIRES AGAIN.=>EXT. TRASH MESA. ANOTHER SHOT BLASTS by the Spinner to rain trash down on K.
SATELLITE DISH.=>EXT. THE DISH. K approaches a ramshackle DOOR. INT. CAVERNOUS HALL. DAY. K enters A BURROW UNDER THE TRASH MOUNTAIN. Opening up into... INT. “THE ORPHANAGE”. A WIDE OPEN ROOM. THE WALLS ALL MADE FROM MATERIALS RECYCLED FROM TRASH. ARTFULLY RE-CRAFTED INTO NECESSITIES, FURNITURE. DOZENS of pale, ratty ORPHANS sit on the floor. Eating their meal out of bowls in fearful silence. Some have obvious deformities. Others just ill or odd from a life in darkness. Seeing K, the CHILDREN stop still. Eyes wide and astonished. If they’ve ever seen anyone like him it wasn’t lately. They circle K like he was a newfound species. Fascinated. All wanting to poke at him... touch his clothes. AN ORPHAN BOY TAKES K’S HAND. Begins to lead him through. They pass A GIRL curled up with a handcrafted DOLL, its “skin” made of scales fashioned from flattened soda cans. A SHRILL WHISTLE BLASTS from far off. The children all return to their seats on the floor. The Orphan Boy stiffens. Scared. Points ahead. For K to go on alone. K nods his thanks, and enters...
DOCTOR ANA STELLINE=>Younger than you’d expect given all this is hers, 30s. But so very obviously so very bright you never question why. A stratospheric IQ with eyes that do not hide it. Conspicuously lovely for a human not offworld. She sits on the balls of her barefoot feet in the center of the forest simulation. Like some god painting dreams with a wand onto moving canvas. Spinning and MOLDING and moving the images with a palmed INSTRUMENT. As much electronic as musical. Somewhere between performance art and programming.
ANA=>Just unusual.
ANA=>Is moved. Watching this unfold on her SCANNER as... THE HORSE IS INTERRED IN ITS HIDING PLACE... SEALED AWAY... THEN OUTSIDE LARGER KIDS SPRING ON K, MENACING... THEY SURROUND HIM... BEAT HIM... SHOUTING “WHERE IS IT?”... AND... Ana stops the imaging. Affected by what she is seeing. She looks up to K. Seeing him differently because of it. A new sympathy. For a moment, she seems unsure how to answer. K looks to her, expectant. Everything riding on her answer.
INTERVIEWER=>A tall white fountain played.
MOVE...=>-- K PULLS HER BACK TO HIM. THEY KISS... -- ON K... SMILING... IN LOVE... -- ON MARIETTE... UNDER THE SKIN OF LIGHT... SHE FEELS HIS LIPS ON HERS... SEES THE LOOK ON HIS FACE... AND IS MOVED BY A DEPTH OF LOVE SHE NEVER TASTED BEFORE... DIDN’T KNOW
WAS REAL...=>-- JOI STANDS AWAY FROM HIM. HER HOST BODY, BARELY VISIBLE BENEATH HER AS SHE REACHES A HAND BEHIND HER TO UNFASTEN HER DRESS... WHICH FALLS TO THE FLOOR... -- K AND JOI LOOK INTO EACH OTHER’S EYES... JOI STEPS TOWARDS K AND -- EXT. SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES. NIGHT. Looking down a canyon between buildings where... AN AD SPIRE turns day to night with its brilliant light...
AN AD FOR:=>JOI. SMILING RIGHT AT US... knowing... willing... INT. K’S APARTMENT. MORNING. A rare ribbon of TRUE SUNLIGHT through the one small window bisects K and Mariette entwined on the bed. K is awake, eyes open. He observes Mariette, a touch of embarrassment in the light at the intimacy shared in the dark. He rises to the shower. We hear the water spray. ON MARIETTE. Her eyes snap open. Also awake. She slowly gets out of bed and dresses.
GOES DARK.=>ON LUV. Taking note. Rising. Displeased.
POV WIDENS OUT FURTHER:=>THE VEGAS SKYLINE. Recognizable but, like an old stripper, only a shell of debauchery. The hulked MEGASTRUCTURES are all still there. Dark. Empty. Years of neglect. In their day they were fever dreams of debauchery. Decades of sandstorms have scoured away the luster and color. Weeds grow tall in the cracked streets. A thick DUST coat over it all makes equals of everything. It hasn’t rained in forever. One CRUMBLED EGYPTIAN-THEMED HOTEL shows evidence of A BOMB BLAST. Outsized STATUES in ruins around it. THE PILOTFISH POV registers the radiation levels at SAFE. It picks up on a RED DUST DEVIL, STREAKED WITH BLACK.
A BEE=>Flitting about. It waggles a crooked path to land...
ON HIS ARM=>K is speechless. He has never seen the like. He is careful not to move lest he scare it off. The bee takes off anyway. Flies a deliberate line through the grand statue’s legs. K follows after it, as... The BEE joins another. MORE BEES STILL. Until the loose cluster rejoins... A SWARM OF THOUSANDS. THIS was the dark cloud he saw from afar. They move as one. Their HUMS together a ROAR. Circling in waves around an ARTIFICIAL FEEDING SYSTEM. K steps below the vertical FEEDER. Powered by a solar panel that has recently been SLEEVE-SWIPED clean of dust. K TURNS. HEARING SOMETHING MELDED WITH THE WIND. MUSIC.
A PIANO=>The keys open. K taps a KEY. The note rings through the airy space. Makes the current of floating dust vibrate. At which K notices -- TWO EYES staring at him in the dark --
A MANGY DOG=>It is, at a glance, the ugliest dog on earth. Flea bitten and ragged. But a real, live dog. It cocks its head at K. ON K. Utterly awed by this animal. Homely as it is, it is miraculous to him. He moves slowly toward it. Hand out. Hoping to touch it. So lost in the discovery, he is completely surprised by -- THE CLICK OF A GUN --
MAN’S VOICE=>“You mightn’t happen to have a piece of cheese about you now, boy?”
DECKARD’S ICONIC BLASTER=>Comes out of the SHADOWS half into the LIGHT. Preceding
RICK DECKARD=>Strong, tireless. Seasoned by time and, like teak or copper, far more handsome for the patina. But also something... cracky about him. Thoughts obscure, running together. Enough to keep us guessing if he’s gone touched left alone out here too long... Or maybe just a calculated way to keep an intruder guessing... K stares down the blaster. Takes a gamble.
A CRASH.=>Deckard Looks over the balcony. No sign. INT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE.
DECKARD=>Walks down the stairs after him slowly. Confident. The dog obediently follows. INT. LOBBY. K is gone. Survived the jump. Leaving only blood. Deckard calmly tracks K’s movements in the dust.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!=>INT. THEATRE ENTRANCE AREA. Deckard scans through the plume of DUST. Sees...
A DOOR CLOSE.=>BY AN OLD LOUNGE. A tattered SIGN for the last SHOW that played there, curiously called “THE HOMAGE.” INT. THEATRE ENTRANCE AREA. ON DECKARD. He THROWS A SWITCH in an electrical panel. Power HUMS through ancient wire. INT. “THE HOMAGE” LOUNGE AND THEATER. Great acts once played here, back when there was leisure. Is hiding. Forcing his breath shallow and quiet. LIGHTS SNAP ON. WHIRLING, FUNHOUSE FLASHING. Making it hard to see. MUSIC starts. Loud, thrumming. ON THE DARK STAGE... A HOLOGRAM ILLUMINES THE CENTER. ELVIS. Brought back to life. Performing “Suspicious Minds” again on the Vegas stage. A glitchy but inspired holographic resurrection. We look through Elvis’ BODY wrought in LIGHT to see -- K crosses an open aisle. Staring through. Disoriented. He looks at Elvis walking further downstage -- K hides behind a sofa, looks to the door. No sign of Deckard. When -- A SHOT FIRES -- EXPLODING THE SEAT BEHIND K -- nearly taking his head off. K ducks down to see --
DECKARD=>Stalking him through the MAZE OF BOOTHS AND TABLES AND STAGE LIGHTING. Gun lose and comfortable in his hand, as --
ONSTAGE=>Elvis begins a MEDLEY. His hologram begins to falter. The garish show begins to SKIP and FLICKER like a worn VHS -- until the system unravels -- and Elvis is joined by MORE HOLOGRAPHIC LAS VEGAS ICONS: CHORUS GIRLS and MAGICIAN’S TIGERS. LIBERACE. MARILYN MONROE. REDD FOXX. ACROBATS. All resurrected in LIGHT. A nostalgia act in chaos. K loses his bearings in the confusion. As the show spins into a tumult. Everything it’s got. Classic icons and icons to be fill the space. CIRCUS ELEPHANTS spring to life. LASER LIGHTS blind and flash. Deckard’s eye is keen. The movements of his blaster exact. He looks behind a table. Nothing. Around a bar. Nothing. He steps through the FLICKERING ELVIS to see -- K’S BLOOD ON THE FLOOR. WITH K. Crawling. He stops as a MAGICIAN’S TIGER approaches.
DECKARD=>Sees the tiger cross. Heads toward it, gun raised when -- THE LIGHTS CUT OUT -- then instantly FLASHING BRIGHT AGAIN -- HOLOGRAMS momentarily BLINDING Deckard -- K LEAPS THROUGH THE HOLOGRAMS. Knocks Deckard down. KNOCKS his blaster away. Letting his strength out. Deckard swings. K takes one hit. Catches the second. THROWS Deckard back. Deckard has the meanness of experience but none of K’s speed.
LUV=>Enters. Shuts the now broken door behind her. Scans the small space quickly. Ascertaining it all at a glance. Her eye lands on... Sapper’s glasses. Then -- K’S BOOK. She studies its cover. Then finds THE BOX the emanator came it. It makes her smile, as if she knows everything about him. The smile drops at finding -- THE BROKEN ANTENNA beside it.
A PILOTFISH DEPLOYS.=>It floats gently. Quiet as a computer fan. It moves down the boulevard. Seeking. Then... It locks in on something. Begins a straight line for...
THE CASINO=>INT. LUV’S SPINNER. DAWN. As Luv closes in, A PROMPT comes UPSCREEN. ON IT: THE PILOTFISH’S VIEW of Deckard’s penthouse. Two bodies within. “TARGET LOCKED. DETONATE?”
BOOM! DECKARD’S SPINNER EXPLODES!=>The world BLURS. K is ROCKED by the blast -- K SMASHES into the wall. K manages to sit up. Wind and soot in his face as -- ONE OF THE DARK SPINNERS LANDS INSIDE THE PENTHOUSE. DARK FIGURES get out and DRAG UNCONSCIOUS DECKARD toward the Spinner. K tries to move for Deckard -- but his abdomen has been PUNCTURED by debris. Deckard fights his captors brutally, but they are too many. Fighting pain, K staggers to his feet. Is GRABBED from behind. K BREAKS the hand that clasped him and DROPS its owner. Disarms with MAN lugging Deckard and SHOOTS HIM AND ONE MORE. The team doesn’t last long against K unleashed. Until -- A FOOT KICKS K -- BONES FRAGMENTING IN HIS CHEST. ANOTHER KICK. K SLAMS INTO THE GROUND WITH BRUTAL FORCE.
LUV=>Steps toward K. Calm, amused, a successful acquisition assumed.
THE EMANATOR GOES FLYING.=>K is on his back -- breath short -- then CUT OFF as LUV STOMPS HIS CHEST. His insides rupture. Luv steps close. Ready to end him when --
JOI HAS PROJECTED=>Enough of a distraction that Luv for the moment leaves K. Steps over ahead of K to... The emanator. Luv sees K reach and crawl for it. Trying to reach it before she does. Luv locks eyes with Joi. Raises a foot. K shakes his head. Don’t. Luv thrills at the chance to administer such a unique pain.
LUV KICKS HIS FACE.=>The world goes BLACK. ON K’S EYE. Flickering OPEN.
CAMPFIRE BURNING...=>SENSES A HUMAN PRESENCE BESIDE HIM. HIS EYES CLOSE AGAIN...
MARIETTE=>Genuine concern on her face. She pets the Dog’s head admiringly.
RACHAEL=>Precisely as when he met her. As she was in the holo. Down to the lashes. Flesh and blood. Young again. Remade. Authentic. Inauthentic. ON DECKARD. Breath gone. Wallace presents his offer.
BESIDE HER.=>Mariette looks to K with new feeling. Trusting. Wanting him to trust her. She stands aside, to REVEAL -- MARIETTE’S HANDLER FROM THE BAR She walks toward K. She wears the same DARK GLASSES even here. In the dark. This is FREYSA. She speaks with the calm heavenbound confidence of the eerily devout. The unique patois of a colony we will never visit.
FREYSA=>He don’t matter.
FURNACE. CHIN SET, DETERMINED.=>INSERT CUT: ON ANA. LOOKING AT K.
THE SEPULVEDA SEA WALL=>Where the risen ocean meets city. Stretching for MILES. DENSE FOG spills over like a waterfall. EXT. ABOVE THE SEA WALL. The caravan cuts through the thick FOG. Keeps low to the rough, stormy surface. Sprayed by angry waves. INT. TRANSPORT VAN. Condensation streaks the glass. Luv scans the skies around them. Eyes missing nothing. Satisfied, she fixes her unblinking eyes on --
THE SEA WALL=>It looms large as they drop toward it.
ON THE TRANSPORT=>Perched unsteadily at the sea wall’s sloped base. A violent WAVE BASHES over it. INT. TRANSPORT VAN.
SNAPS BACK, THEN SLUMPS. DECKARD=>Looks up. Light suddenly streams on his face.
ON K=>Backlit and FIRING as he comes. Heedless of his exposure. Luv holds her position until -- SHE FIRES AT K -- K FIRES -- HITS LUV -- WHO FLIES BACK WITH THE IMPACT.
ON K=>Coming for Deckard. Even as Deckard watches the BLOOD blossom on K’s chest. They meet eyes, when -- LUV CHARGES K LIKE A TRAIN. TACKLES HIM. They tumble like lovers. Luv destroys what’s left of K’s shoulder, when -- A CRUSHING WAVE POUNDS THE TRANSPORT AGAINST THE SEA WALL.
WATER FILLS THE VEHICLE. K AND LUV=>Crush together against the shattered roof to spill out onto --
HER KNIFE SINGS=>K dodges it -- blocks it -- grabs it by the blade -- not seeing --
HER SECOND KNIFE=>The blade slips out of K’s gut before he felt it go in. K falls to his knees.
HOLDING UNDERWATER.=>LUV FIGHTS HIM WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAS. TEETH BARED, BLOODY. BUT K JUST TAKES THE PAIN. DOES NOT LET GO. INT. UNDERWATER. ON LUV. She lashes out, wild, feral spasms. Her mouth working. Unable to find the words to properly hate. One pupil goes wide. The eye rolls back in its socket, giving a clear view of the pinprick of color underneath.
AND SHE GOES STILL.=>ON LUV. An air bubble of resignation escapes her lips. INT. TRANSPORT VAN. THE CREAK OF METAL ABOUT TO GIVE WAY. THE WATER LEVEL RISES. DECKARD IS ENTIRELY UNDERWATER. LUNGS AFLAME. K swims to him. Breaks his retrains. K and Deckard dive out of the sinking tomb.
IN THE OCEAN.=>K and Deckard swim. Wave and current conspire to drown them. A WAVE BATTERS K. WE LOSE SIGHT OF HIM IN THE WATER.
JOI=>Would you read to me.
