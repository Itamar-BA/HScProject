LORD BERNARD=>Of course, of course!
NINA FAWCETT=>All right, out with it. What’s amiss?
SECRETARY BRYCE=>Lord Bernard, we do appreciate the use of your magnificent home.
YES, FAWCETT--SOMETHING WRONG WITH=>YOUR EARS?!?
SIDNEY VARNON THORNTON=>Best bring your long johns. You might well be off to the North Pole.
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE=>Most of it’s blank, as you can see. Nothing’s really known of it at all. The rivers are all a guess. These are rubber centers here--very profitable. Some are even apparently quite lavish.
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE=>Neither country will accept mapping done by the other, so they’ve requested us to act--as referee.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE=>Terrible thing, a man’s love of drink... And gaming...
NINA FAWCETT=>One more kiss, please. We may never meet again.
JACK FAWCETT=>Then why are you going?
PERCY FAWCETT=>Good. Nothing to shed.
A VOICE=>Cattle! Coming through!
PERCY FAWCETT=>And you know the river?
HENRY COSTIN=>It’s nothing at all...
PERCY FAWCETT=>Feel free to summarize.
PERCY FAWCETT=>There’s...pottery--right beneath our feet!
PERCY FAWCETT=>I can stand, thank you.
JAMES MURRAY=>You know, I am a biologist and explorer myself--I was second-in- command to Mr. Shackelton on his Antartica expedition.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE=>My friend--your recent exploits have opened every door to you--so I would suggest keeping such sightings to yourself. Of course, no one here would dispute you believed you saw it. But a trip like that--very hard on the mind. Very hard.
PERCY FAWCETT=>Let go! You pink-eyed weakling-- LET GO!
HENRY COSTIN=>Good riddance, I say.
PERCY FAWCETT=>
PERCY FAWCETT=>I came close, Cheeky. I had to turn back, for the good of the men.
PERCY FAWCETT=>I face humiliation now... I did everything I could and I accomplished nothing.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE=>What about it, Percy? Will you apologize?
PERCY FAWCETT=>I hereby resign myself from this institution. And I shall proceed on my own. Good day.
BRIAN FAWCETT=>Papa, why are we at war?
NINA FAWCETT=>We’ll bring you home as soon as we’re able, darling.
PERCY FAWCETT=>I’ve something for you.
PERCY FAWCETT=>He’ll perform splendidly. I’ve learned from the past that character is more important than experience.
PERCY FAWCETT=>He will be my companion on this historic expedition.
PERCY FAWCETT=>Life is short and the world is wide.
NINA FAWCETT=>It has taken all my strength of will to push horrors out of my thoughts...
