FEMALE VOICE=>What do you make of it?
MALE VOICE=>It appears to be a probe, Captain. From an intelligence unknown to us.
FEMALE VOICE=>Continue transmitting; Universal Peace and Hello in all known languages. Get me Starfleet Command.
CAPTAIN=>Starfleet Command, this is USS Saratoga patrolling Sector 5, neutral zone. We are tracking a probe of unknown origin on apparent trajectory to the Terran solar system. Attempts to communicate with the probe have been negative on all known frequencies.
STARFLEET VOICE=>Continue tracking, Saratoga. We will analyze transmissions and advise.
CAPTAIN=>Roger, Starfleet, Saratoga out.
HELMSMAN=>Range 400,000 kilometers, closing. Here it comes again.
CAPTAIN=>What's causing that!?
SCIENCE OFFICER=>Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
CAPTAIN=>Can you isolate the wave?
SCIENCE OFFICER=>Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
CAPTAIN=>Yellow alert! Shields up. Helm, reduce closing speed!
HELMSMAN=>Captain, Thruster controls have been neutralized!
CAPTAIN=>Emergency Thrusters!
HELMSMAN=>No response, Captain!
CAPTAIN'S VOICE=>Emergency lights!
CAPTAIN=>Damage report!
SCIENCE OFFICER=>Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
CAPTAIN=>We're out of control -- Rig for
SCIENCE OFFICER=>They've finished us. And we don't even know what they want...
CAPTAIN=>Give me whatever you've got on the emergency channel. Starfleet Command, this is Saratoga. Can you hear me...? Come in, please... Come in, please...
CHAPEL=>Thank you for coming. It's not
SAREK=>Am I to late to testify?
CHAPEL=>I don't know.
KLINGON VOICE=>There! Hold the image, hold!
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>Behold! The quintessential devil in these matters! James T. Kirk, renegade and terrorist! Not only is he responsible for the murder of a Klingon crew; the theft of a Klingon vessel. See now the real plot and intentions:
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself! The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people! We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
SAREK=>Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
SAREK=>Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
SAREK=>Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
COUNCIL PRESIDENT=>Order. There will be no further outbursts from the floor.
SAREK=>Mr. President, I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>Personal bias! His son was saved by Kirk!
COUNCIL PRESIDENT=>Mr. Ambassador, with all respect, the Council's deliberations are over. You have been allowed to speak in order to put your views on the record.
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>Then Kirk goes unpunished?!?
COUNCIL PRESIDENT=>Admiral Kirk has been charged with nine violations of Starfleet regulations...
KLINGON AMBASSADOR=>Starfleet regulations? Outrageous! Remember this well: there will be no peace as long as Kirk lives!
COUNCIL PRESIDENT=>Sarek of Vulcan, with all respect -- we ask you to return Kirk and his crew to answer for their crimes.
SAREK=>With respect to you, Mr. President, there is only one crime: denying Kirk and his crew the honors they so richly deserve.
COUNCIL PRESIDENT=>... You are welcome to remain and
KIRK=>Captain's Log, Stardate 8390...
KIRK'S VOICE=>We are in the third month of our Vulcan exile. We are uncertain about the progress of Captain Spock's memory training.. And it was Doctor McCoy with a fine sense of historical irony, who decided on a name for our captured Klingon vessel.
KIRK'S VOICE=>... And like those mutineers of 500 years ago, we too have a hard choice to make. A choice made harder because we are all too old to suffer fools gladly... Nevertheless:
KIRK=>Let the record show that the Commander and the crew of the late Starship Enterprise have voted unanimously to return to Earth to face the consequences of their actions in the rescue of their comrade, Captain Spock. Thank you all... Repair stations, please.
KIRK=>Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
SCOTTY=>Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
BONES=>You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
KIRK=>We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
BONES=>I just wish we could cloak the stench.
SAAVIK=>Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
KIRK=>Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
SAAVIK=>And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
KIRK=>Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling?
SAAVIK=>I am well, Admiral.
SPOCK=>Resume.
SPOCK=>I do not understand.
SPOCK=>I do not understand the final question...
AMANDA=>You are half human. The Computer knows that.
SPOCK=>The question is irrelevant.
AMANDA=>Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
SPOCK=>As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
AMANDA=>Where must you go?
SPOCK=>To Earth. To offer testimony.
AMANDA=>You do this -- for friendship?
SPOCK=>I do this because I was there,
AMANDA=>Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
SPOCK=>I would accept that as an axiom.
AMANDA=>Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the one -- you -- was more important to them.
SPOCK=>Humans make illogical decisions...
AMANDA=>... They do, indeed.
COUNCIL PRESIDENT=>Status report, Admiral!
MORROW=>Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
COUNCIL PRESIDENT=>"Neutralized?" How?
MORROW=>We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
COUNCIL PRESIDENT=>Can you protect us?
MORROW=>We are launching everything we have.
CONTROLLER ONE=>Excelsior and Intrepid are cleared to depart. Open space dock doors.
CONTROLLER TWO=>Sir! Space dock doors are inoperative!
CONTROLLER ONE=>Keep trying. Excelsior and Intrepid stand by! Malfunction on exit doors.
INTREPID VOICE=>Control, Intrepid. Never mind. We can't get powered up!
CONTROLLER TWO=>Space doors not responding. All Emergency systems are non- functional.
CONTROLLER ONE=>Engage reserve power. Starfleet Command, this is Space dock on emergency channel. We have lost all internal power. Repeat, we have lost all power!...
KIRK=>Systems report. Communications?
UHURA=>Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu?
SULU=>Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
KIRK=>Weapons systems?
CHEKOV=>Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
KIRK=>I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
CHEKOV=>We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
KIRK=>Most prudent. Engine room. Report, Scotty.
SCOTTY=>We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
KIRK=>Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott. Prepare for departure.
KIRK=>Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
SAAVIK=>Yes, Admiral. Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.
SAAVIK=>Good day, Captain Spock... May your journey be free of incident.
SPOCK=>Live long and prosper, Lieutenant.
SPOCK=>Permission to come aboard.
KIRK=>Permission granted.
SPOCK=>Thank you, Admiral.
KIRK=>Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
SPOCK=>It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire. I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
KIRK=>Well, I... find that understandable I mean, you've been through a lot. Station, please.
KIRK=>What do you mean?
BONES=>I mean him, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
KIRK=>It'll come back to him.
BONES=>Are you sure? That's what I thought.
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
PRESIDENT=>What is estimate cloud cover of the Planet at this time?
COMPUTER VOICE=>93.2 percent. Probe now orbiting South Pacific. Estimate total cloud cover by next orbit. No known way to dissipate cloud cover.
MORROW=>Notify all stations: Starfleet Emergency, Red Alert. Switch power immediately to Planetary Reserves.
MORROW=>Mr. President, even with Planetary Reserves we cannot survive without the sun.
PRESIDENT=>I am well aware of that, Admiral.
PRESIDENT=>Sarek... Is there no answer we can give this Probe?
SAREK=>It is difficult to answer if you do not understand the question. Mr. President, perhaps you should transmit a planet distress signal, while we still have time.
SULU=>Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
KIRK=>Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
CHEKOV=>No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
KIRK=>That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
UHURA=>Very active, Sir. Multi-phasic transmissions, overlapping.... almost a gibberish... Let me see if I can sort it out.
BONES=>Hi... Busy?
SPOCK=>Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
BONES=>Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine. I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
SPOCK=>... My shoes...
BONES=>Forget it... How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
SPOCK=>I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
BONES=>Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
SPOCK=>It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
BONES=>You're joking...!
SPOCK=>A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
BONES=>You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
SPOCK=>Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
47A FAVORING UHURAH'S STATION=>47A
KIRK=>What is it?
UHURA=>Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
KIRK=>On screen!
PRESIDENT'S IMAGE=>This is... President of... Grave Warning: Do not approach Planet Earth... To all Starships, repeat, do not approach! ... Orbiting Probe... emits transmissions on energy wave unknown to us... Wave, directed at our oceans... Ionized our atmosphere... All power sources have failed. Starships are powerless. ... A cloud envelope has enveloped the Planet. Heavy rain and flooding. Temperature dropping to critical level. Planet cannot survive unless Probe is responded to... Probe transmissions dominate all standard channels. Communications may not be possible... Save yourselves. Avoid the Planet Earth... Farewell.
KIRK=>Spock? What do you make of it?
SPOCK=>Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
BONES=>Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people
SPOCK=>There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
BONES=>I liked him better before he died.
KIRK=>Bones --
BONES=>Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
KIRK=>Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
SPOCK=>A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
KIRK=>Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
UHURA=>I'll try, sir.
UHURA=>I think I have it, sir.
KIRK=>Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
UHURA=>Yes, sir.
SPOCK=>Fascinating. If my suspicion is correct, there can be no response to this message.
KIRK=>Where are you going?!
SPOCK=>To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
KIRK=>Bones, stay here.
BONES=>No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
KIRK=>Spock...?
SPOCK=>As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
KIRK=>Whales?
SPOCK=>Specifically, Humpback Whales.
BONES=>That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
KIRK=>It's possible. Whales were on Earth far earlier than man...
SPOCK=>10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
BONES=>... My God...
KIRK=>Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
SPOCK=>The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
KIRK=>Is there any other planet where this species exists?
SPOCK=>The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
KIRK=>That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
SPOCK=>That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
KIRK=>But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
SPOCK=>There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
BONES=>You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
SPOCK=>That is what I said, Doctor.
BONES=>Then how.?
BONES=>Now wait just a damn minute.
KIRK=>Spock, start your computations for time warp. Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
KIRK=>Scotty, how long is this bay?
SCOTTY=>About 60 feet, Admiral.
KIRK=>That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
SCOTTY=>I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
BONES=>Off the deep end, Mr. Scott.
KIRK=>Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
SCOTTY=>. Humpbacked - people.?
KIRK=>Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
SCOTTY=>Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
KIRK=>You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
SCOTTY=>Two?
KIRK=>It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY=>The great flood and Noah's Ark. what a way to finally go.
BONES=>You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
KIRK=>We've done it before.
BONES=>Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
KIRK=>Would you prefer to do nothing?
BONES=>I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
KIRK=>-- That's the general idea.
BONES=>That's crazy!
KIRK=>If you have a better idea - now's the time.
KIRK=>Mr. Spock, your computations?
SPOCK=>In progress, Admiral.
KIRK=>Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
COMM OFFICER=>Sir... I'm picking up a faint transmission... It's Admiral Kirk calling...!
MORROW=>On screen!
MORROW=>Satellite reserve power, now!
KIRK'S IMAGE=>... Analysis... Probe call... Captain Spock... Opinion... extinct species, Humpback Whale... proper response... Do you read me...?
MORROW=>Stabilize! Emergency reserve!
KIRK=>Starfleet, if you read, we are going to attempt time travel. We are computing our trajectory at this time...
SAREK=>Good luck, Kirk. And all you go with you.
SPOCK=>Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
KIRK=>What is our target in time?
SPOCK=>The late 20th Century.
KIRK=>Surely you can be more specific...
SPOCK=>Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
KIRK=>What are the variables...?
KIRK=>You've programmed that from memory...?
SPOCK=>I have.
BONES=>Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
SPOCK=>Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
KIRK=>Mr. Spock... None of us has doubts about your memory. Engage computer. Prepare for Warp Speed.
KIRK=>Shields, Mr. Chekov.
CHEKOV=>Shields, aye.
KIRK=>May fortune favor the foolish. Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
SULU=>Warp two... three...
KIRK=>Steady as she goes...
SULU=>Warp five... seven...
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>I don't think she'll hold together, sir!
KIRK=>No choice now, Scotty!
CHEKOV=>Sir, heat shields at maximum!
SULU=>Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
SULU=>Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
KIRK=>Steady!!... Now, Mr. Sulu!
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
SULU=>... Aye sir...?
KIRK=>What is our condition?
SULU=>Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
KIRK=>Picture, please.
KIRK=>Earth... But when?... Spock?
SPOCK=>Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
KIRK=>Well done, Mr. Spock.
UHURA=>Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
KIRK=>On speakers.
KIRK=>Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
SPOCK=>Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
KIRK=>Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
SULU=>We are crossing the terminator into night.
SPOCK=>Homing in on the west coast of North America...
UHURA=>Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
KIRK=>From a city? That doesn't make sense....
SULU=>Perhaps thy are stranded in the Bay, sir?... Or in captivity?
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Admiral, you and Spock better get down here...!
KIRK=>Continue approach...
SCOTTY=>They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
KIRK=>Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY=>Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
KIRK=>I can't believe we've come this far
SCOTTY=>Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
SPOCK=>There is a 20th Century possibility.
KIRK=>Explain.
SPOCK=>If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
KIRK=>But you said toxic.
SPOCK=>We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
KIRK=>Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
SPOCK=>Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
BONES=>It doesn't look all that different.
KIRK=>Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
SULU=>Aye, sir. Descending.
KIRK=>We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
CHEKOV=>Yes, sir.
KIRK=>Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
BONES=>Oh, joy.
KIRK=>Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
UHURA=>I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
KIRK=>Right. Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
KIRK=>This is an extremely primitive and paranoid culture. Mr. Chekov, issue a phaser and communicator to each team. We'll maintain radio silence except in emergency, all transmissions to
1ST GARBAGE MAN=>So I told her: if you think I'm laying out sixty bucks for a goddam toaster oven you got another thing coming.
2ND GARBAGE MAN=>So what'd she say?
1ST GARBAGE MAN=>What the fuck was that?
NUMBER TWO=>Did you see that?
NUMBER ONE=>No. And neither did you, so shut up.
KIRK=>We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
UHURA=>283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
KIRK=>Everyone remember where we parked.
BONES=>It's a miracle these people ever got out of the 23rd century.
KIRK=>Damn, they're still using money. We're going to need some.
KIRK=>You people wait here... And spread out. We look like a cadet review. ... Spock --
CAR DRIVER=>Watch were you're going, you dumb ass!
KIRK=>And double dumb ass on you!
THE BOY=>Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?
SULU=>Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na. I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
THE BOY=>Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii. Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
SULU=>Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na. Wait my son. What is your name?
THE BOY=>Sulu Hikaru.
SULU=>Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira. Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
THE BOY=>Arigato. Sayonara. Thank you, honorable sir.
BONES=>Who was that?
SULU=>That, Doctor, was my great great grandfather.
OWNER=>Yes, they're eighteenth Century American, quite valuable. Are you sure you want to part with them?
KIRK=>How much will you give me?
SPOCK=>Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
KIRK=>And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.
OWNER=>They'd be worth more if the lenses were intact. I'll give you 200 bucks take it or leave it.
KIRK=>Is that a lot?
KIRK=>That's all there is, so nobody splurge. Are we set? Then, good hunting.
KIRK=>Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales. How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
SPOCK=>Simple logic will suffice. We need a map. That one should do.
SPOCK=>I will juxtapose our coordinates on this map and find our destination.
SPOCK=>How do you know this...?
KIRK=>... Simple logic.
SPOCK=>What does it mean, exact change?
BONES=>Would you mind telling me how we plan to convert this tank?
SCOTTY=>Ordinarily, I could do it with a piece of transparent aluminum...
SULU=>You're about 150 years too early for that.
SCOTTY=>I know. We've got to find the 20th Century equivalent...
SULU=>What about that?
UHURA=>Find it?
CHEKOV=>Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
CHEKOV=>Excuse me, sir. Can you direct me to the Navy base in Alameda?
PASSERBY=>The... Navy base?
CHEKOV=>Yes. Where they keep the nuclear wessels.
KIRK=>Excuse me. Can you please stop that sound?
SPOCK=>As you observed, a primitive Culture.
KIRK=>Yes.
SPOCK=>Admiral, may I ask you a question?
KIRK=>Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
SPOCK=>Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
KIRK=>You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
SPOCK=>For example?
KIRK=>Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
SPOCK=>Ah... The giants.
GILLIAN=>Good morning. I'm your guide this morning; my name's Dr. Gillian Taylor, but you can call me Gillian. I'm Assistant Director of the Maritime Cetacean Institute. Please follow me and just give a yell if you can't hear, okay?
GILLIAN=>The Cetacean Institute is the only museum in the world exclusively devoted to whales. As you can see
A MAN=>Do whales attack people -- like in "Moby Dick"?
GILLIAN=>Most whales don't even have teeth. They strain vast amounts of tiny shrimp for food and that is the limit of their hostility. Un- fortunately, their principle enemy is far more aggressive.
KIRK=>You mean man...
GILLIAN=>To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
GILLIAN=>This is mankind's legacy: whales hunted to the brink of extinction. Virtually gone is the Blue Whale, largest creature ever to inhabit the Earth. Despite all attempts at banning whaling, there are still countries
SPOCK=>To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
GILLIAN=>Whoever said the human race was logical? Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
GILLIAN=>This is the largest sea water tank in the world -- and it contains the only two humpback whales in captivity.
GILLIAN=>They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
KIRK=>It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
GILLIAN=>Beautiful, aren't they? And extremely intelligent. Why shouldn't they be? They're swimming around with the largest brains on Earth... Now if you'll follow me please.
GILLIAN=>Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
KIRK=>Why's that?
GILLIAN=>Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
KIRK=>How soon?
GILLIAN=>Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
GILLIAN=>Here's a much better way to see George and Gracie -- underwater.
GILLIAN=>What you're hearing is whale song. It is sung by the male. He'll sing any- where from six to as long as thirty minutes, and then, start again. In the ocean, other whales will pick up the song... And pass it on.
GILLIAN=>The songs change every year, but we still don't know what purpose they serve. Are they navigational? Part of the mating ritual? Or pure communication beyond our comprehension?
AN OLDER WOMAN=>Maybe he's singing to the man.
GILLIAN=>What the hell --! Excuse me! Wait right here!
GILLIAN=>Who the hell are you? What were you doing in there?!
KIRK=>You heard the lady!
SPOCK=>Attempting the hell to communicate.
GILLIAN=>Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
KIRK=>Come on, fellah -- speak up!
SPOCK=>Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
GILLIAN=>Ohhhkay. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
KIRK=>I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
GILLIAN=>The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
SPOCK=>They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
GILLIAN=>I suppose they told you that...?
SPOCK=>The hell they did.
KIRK=>Spock...
SPOCK=>Yes?
KIRK=>About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
SPOCK=>Why not?
KIRK=>Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
SPOCK=>I see.
KIRK=>And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
SPOCK=>I cannot tell a lie.
KIRK=>You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
SPOCK=>Exaggerate.
KIRK=>You've done it before. Can't you remember?
SPOCK=>The hell I can't
KIRK=>What else did you learn from your mind meld?
KIRK=>They have a right to be... Do you think they'll help us?
SPOCK=>I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
KIRK=>... I see.
GILLIAN=>It's all right. Yes. I know. It's okay. They didn't mean any harm.
BOB=>Heard there was some excitement.
GILLIAN=>Just a couple of kooks...
BOB=>How're you doing?
GILLIAN=>Fine. Just fine.
BOB=>Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
GILLIAN=>Bob... it's tearing me apart.
BOB=>I know. I feel the same thing. But
GILLIAN=>Yeah.
BOB=>And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
GILLIAN=>I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence. I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
GILLIAN=>Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
BOB=>Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
GILLIAN=>Why don't I?
JOE=>We all squared away?
BOB=>Looks like it.
JOE=>She's gonna go berserk.
CHEKOV=>Team leader, this is team 2. Come in, please...
UHURA=>I have the coordinates of the reactor...
CHEKOV=>... It gives me a great sense of history.
UHURA=>It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
KIRK'S VOICE=>Team 2? Kirk here....
CHEKOV=>Admiral, we have found the nuclear wessel.
KIRK=>Ah, well done, team 2.
CHEKOV=>And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
KIRK=>Understood. What is your plan?
CHEKOV'S VOICE=>We will beam in tonight, collect the photons and beam out. No one will ever know we were there.
KIRK=>Understood and approved. Keep me informed. Kirk out.
KIRK=>It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
SPOCK=>How will playing cards help?
GILLIAN=>Well, if it isn't Robin Hood and
GILLIAN=>Where're you fellahs heading?
KIRK=>Back to San Francisco.
GILLIAN=>Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
KIRK=>There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
GILLIAN=>I buy that. What about him?
KIRK=>He's harmless. Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
GILLIAN=>LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
KIRK=>We don't want to be any trouble.
GILLIAN=>You've already been that. C'mon.
KIRK=>Thanks.
GILLIAN=>Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
GILLIAN=>So you were at Berkeley.
SPOCK=>I was not.
KIRK=>Memory problems, too.
GILLIAN=>Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
KIRK=>Iowa.
GILLIAN=>A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
KIRK=>Can I ask you something?
GILLIAN=>Go ahead.
KIRK=>What's going to happen when you release the whales?
GILLIAN=>They're gonna hafta take their chances.
KIRK=>What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
GILLIAN=>It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks. What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
SPOCK=>I meant --
KIRK=>He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
GILLIAN=>That's not what he said, farm boy. "Admiral, if we were to assume these whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused -- past tense -- their extinction." I have a photographic memory. I see words.
SPOCK=>Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
GILLIAN=>You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
KIRK=>No, ma'am. No dipshit.
GILLIAN=>Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
SPOCK=>Gracie is pregnant.
GILLIAN=>All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
KIRK=>We can't tell you. Please, just -- let me finish. I
GILLIAN=>Then --
KIRK=>In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
GILLIAN=>Or believe, I'll bet.
KIRK=>Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
SPOCK=>That much is certain.
KIRK=>You know I've got a hunch we'd all be a lot happier talking over dinner. What do you say?
GILLIAN=>You guys like Italian food?
BONES=>I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
SCOTTY=>Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
NICHOLS=>Millions?
BONES=>Thousands; the Professor's understandably upset --
SCOTTY=>Thousands of miles on an invited tour of inspection, only to be informed that I was never invited in the first place!
NICHOLS=>Professor Scott, if you'll --
SCOTTY=>I demand to see the owners! I demand --
BONES=>Professor, just take it easy! Dr. Nichols is offering to take us around personally.
SCOTTY=>He is?
NICHOLS=>With pleasure.
SCOTTY=>Well, that's different.
NICHOLS=>If you'll follow me, Professor --
SCOTTY=>I will. Can my assistant come, too?
NICHOLS=>Of course.
BONES=>Don't bury yourself in the part.
PILOT=>Hi.
SULU=>Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
PILOT=>Right on. You fly?
SULU=>Oh, here and there. I flew something similar in my Academy days.
PILOT=>All right, then this is old stuff to you.
SULU=>Old, yes. But interesting. Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
BONES=>Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
NICHOLS=>Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
SCOTTY=>Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer you.
NICHOLS=>... Yes?
SCOTTY=>I notice you're still working with polymers.
NICHOLS=>Sill? What else would I be working with?
SCOTTY=>Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
NICHOLS=>That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
SCOTTY=>Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
NICHOLS=>... Are you joking?
BONES=>He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
NICHOLS=>Please...
SCOTTY=>Computer --
SCOTTY=>Hello? Computer...?
NICHOLS=>Just use the keyboard...
SCOTTY=>The keyboard... How quaint.
NICHOLS=>Transparent aluminum?
SCOTTY=>That's the ticket, laddie.
NICHOLS=>... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
BONES=>You'll be rich beyond the dreams of avarice.
SCOTTY=>So, is it worth something? Or should I just punch "clear"...
NICHOLS=>No! No... What did you have in mind...?
BONES=>A moment alone, please.
BONES=>You know, if we give him the formula, we'll be altering the future.
SCOTTY=>Why? how do you know he didn't invent the thing!
KIRK'S VOICE=>Right here is fine.
GILLIAN=>You sure you won't change your mind?
SPOCK=>Is there something wrong with the one I have?
KIRK=>Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
GILLIAN=>How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
SPOCK=>Gracie does. I'll be right here.
GILLIAN=>He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
KIRK=>It's his way.
GILLIAN=>Do you trust me?
KIRK=>Implicitly.
GILLIAN=>Good. A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
WAITER=>And you, sir?
KIRK=>Make it two.
KIRK=>So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
GILLIAN=>Just lucky, I guess.
KIRK=>You're upset about losing the whales.
GILLIAN=>... You're very perceptive.
KIRK=>How will that be done, exactly?
GILLIAN=>They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
KIRK=>Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
GILLIAN=>See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
KIRK=>You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
GILLIAN=>You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
GILLIAN=>Thanks. Cheers.
KIRK=>If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
GILLIAN=>I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
GILLIAN=>Where could you take them?
KIRK=>Hm?
GILLIAN=>My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
KIRK=>It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
GILLIAN=>Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
KIRK=>What do you mean now?
GILLIAN=>Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived. Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that. Damn.
GILLIAN=>What's that?
KIRK=>What's what?
GILLIAN=>You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
KIRK=>What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
SCOTTY=>Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
118B BACK TO SCENE=>118B
KIRK=>Oh I see -- Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
GILLIAN=>Wanna try it from the top?
KIRK=>Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
GILLIAN=>... Who are you?
KIRK=>Who do you think I am?
GILLIAN=>Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
KIRK=>No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
GILLIAN=>Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
KIRK=>All right. The truth?
GILLIAN=>I'm all ears.
KIRK=>That's what you think. Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late
GILLIAN=>Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
KIRK=>You want the details?
GILLIAN=>Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
KIRK=>Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
GILLIAN=>Jesus, you are persistent. Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
KIRK=>Noon tomorrow...?!
WAITER=>Who gets the bad news...?
GILLIAN=>Don't' tell me: they don't have money in the 23rd Century.
KIRK=>Well, we don't. Come on. I don't have much time now.
GILLIAN=>Uh... Could we have this to go?
UHURA=>How long?
CHEKOV=>Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
GILLIAN=>Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
KIRK=>You asked. Now, will you tell me something? George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
GILLIAN=>Sorry, that's classified. I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
KIRK=>It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
GILLIAN=>So. There we are.
KIRK=>Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
GILLIAN=>I bet you're a damn good poker player.
KIRK=>Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
GILLIAN=>Here... In the park?
KIRK=>Right.
KIRK=>Status?
SPOCK=>The tank will be finished by morning...
KIRK=>That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
SPOCK=>No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
KIRK=>Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
SPOCK=>In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
KIRK=>Our mission! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of
OPERATOR=>The hell... There it is again.
TECHNICIAN=>That's weird. Commander...
C.D.O.=>Thought you were running a test program...
TECHNICIAN=>Aye, sir, but we're getting an apparent power drain through the module. It's coming from somewhere in the ship...
C.D.O.=>C.I.C., Command Duty Officer Rogerson. Yes, Chief, we're tracking it here, too. What do you make of it? You sure?... Check the Video scan, I need a confirm. He thinks there's an intruder in one of the MMR's.
131B UHURA AND CHEKOV=>131B
UHURA=>Scotty: we're ready for beam out. Scotty... Can you hear me...?
131C THE C.I.C. ROOM=>131C
C.D.O.=>Yes, Chief?... Confirmed, Roger that.
C.D.O.=>Mardet C.O. this is Commander Rodgerson, the Command Duty Officer. We have and intruder in the #4 M.M.R. I say again...
131D OMITTED 131D 131E=>131E
131F UHURA AND CHEKOV=>131F
UHURA=>Scotty... Come in please... Do you read.
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Aye, lass, I hear you.
SCOTTY=>... My transporter power's down to minimal. I got to bring you in one at a time. Stand by...
CHEKOV=>Take the collector. You go first!
CHEKOV=>Scotty... How soon... Hello...?
SCOTTY=>Chekov, you're breaking up. Please signal again. Chekov, can you hear me?
CHEKOV=>Scotty... Now would be a good time --
MARINE LEADER=>Freeze!
CHEKOV=>Precisely what does this mean -- "freeze?"
FBI AGENT=>Lt. Commander Pavel Chekov, Starfleet, United Federation of Planets.
FBI AGENT=>All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
CHEKOV=>Like what?
FBI AGENT=>Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
CHEKOV=>My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
FBI AGENT=>All right. Let's take it from the top.
CHEKOV=>The top of what?
FBI AGENT=>Name?
CHEKOV=>My name?
FBI AGENT=>No, my name.
CHEKOV=>I do not know your name.
FBI AGENT=>You play games with me and you're through
FBI AGENT=>What do you think?
CIVILIAN=>He's a Russkie.
FBI AGENT=>No kidding... He may be a russkie, all right, but he's a retard or something.
CIVILIAN=>We better call Washington...
CHEKOV=>Don't move.
FBI AGENT=>Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
CHEKOV=>I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
FBI AGENT=>Go ahead. Stun me.
CHEKOV=>I'm wery sorry, but --
CHEKOV=>It must be the radiation...
FBI AGENT=>Someone sound a general alarm. better tell the Marines to go easy,
139A OMITTED 139A 139B=>139B
F.B.I. MAN=>Damn... Get an ambulance...
KIRK=>Any luck...?
UHURA=>Nothing... I should never have left him...
KIRK=>Uhura, you did what was necessary. Keep trying. You'll find him...
KIRK=>Mr. Scott, you promised me an estimate on the dilithium crystals...
SCOTTY=>It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
KIRK=>Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
SCOTTY=>I'll try, sir. Scott out. Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
SPOCK=>... He is a man of deep feelings.
SCOTTY=>... So what else is new...
BOB=>They left last night. We didn't want a mob scene with the press, it wouldn't have been good for them. Besides -- we thought it would be easier on you this way.
GILLIAN=>You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
BOB=>Gillian --
SULU=>... How the hell did they ever keep these things in the air...?
150A OMITTED=>150A
GILLIAN=>Kirk! Kirk! Listen to me! Oh, God, Kirk, I need you!!
SCOTTY=>Admiral, we have problem.
KIRK=>Stand by, Scotty!
GILLIAN=>Kirk!! Please, Kirk!!
KIRK=>Hello, Alice. Welcome to wonderland.
GILLIAN=>It's true... what you said...
KIRK=>Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
KIRK=>Steady, now. We need your help.
GILLIAN=>Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
KIRK=>It's all real. Look. The storage tanks for the whales.
GILLIAN=>But Kirk...
KIRK=>We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
GILLIAN=>Kirk. They're gone.
KIRK=>... Gone?!
GILLIAN=>They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
KIRK=>... Damn!
GILLAIN=>But they're tagged, I told you. Can't you go find them?
KIRK=>At the moment, we can't go anywhere.
GILLIAN=>What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
KIRK=>A spaceship with a missing man.
SPOCK=>Admiral. Full power is restored.
KIRK=>Thank you, Spock.
SPOCK=>Hello, Doctor. Welcome aboard.
UHURA'S VOICE=>Admiral -- are you there?
KIRK=>Yes, Uhura -- what's wrong?
UHURA=>I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
KIRK=>Uhura!... Where!
UHURA=>Mercy Hospital.
GILLIAN=>That's in the Mission District.
BONES=>Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
KIRK=>What do you think, Spock?
SPOCK=>Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
KIRK=>Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
SPOCK=>No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
KIRK=>Right. Will you help us?
GILLIAN=>... How?
BONES=>We'll need to look like physicians.
KIRK=>We'll check this way; you try down there...
WOMAN=>Doctor...
BONES=>What's the matter with you?
WOMAN=>Kidney... dialysis...
BONES=>Dialysis?? What is this, the dark ages? Here, swallow one of these.
BONES=>Call me if you have a problem.
KIRK=>They're holding him in a security corridor one flight up. His condition is critical.
BONES=>Come on.
1ST INTERN=>So, Weintraub says radical chemotherapy or she's gonna croak. Just like that...
2ND INTERN=>And Gottlieb?
1ST INTERN=>Well, what'd you expect? All he
BONES=>Unbelievable.
1ST INTERN=>You have a different view, Doctor?
BONES=>Sounds like the goddam Spanish Inquisition...
BONES=>Out of the way!
POLICEMAN=>Sorry, doctor! we have strict orders...
BONES=>Dammit, this woman has immediate post prandial upper abdominal distension! Do you want an acute case on your hands?
KIRK=>What did you say she was getting?
BONES=>Cramps.
DOCTOR=>Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
BONES=>We're just -- observing.
DOCTOR=>I was not informed about observers.
DOCTOR=>What the hell do you think you're doing?
BONES=>Reading the patient's vital signs.
KIRK=>An experimental device, doctor.
BONES=>Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
DOCTOR=>What's your degree in, dentistry?
BONES=>How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
DOCTOR=>Fundoscopic examination --
BONES=>Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
DOCTOR=>A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
BONES=>My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
DOCTOR=>I don't know who the hell you are, but I'm going to have you removed.
KIRK=>Doctors, doctors, this is highly unprofessional --
KIRK=>Quite harmless, I assure you.
KIRK=>Ladies. Please...
167B BACK TO SCENE=>167B
BONES=>Chemotherapy... fundoscopic examination... dealing with medievalism here!
BONES=>Wake up, man, wake up!
KIRK=>Come on, Pavel...
BONES=>He's coming 'round, Jim...
KIRK=>Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
CHEKOV=>... Chekov... Pavel H... Rank - ... Admiral...
GILLIAN=>Don't you guys have any enlisted types...?
CHEKOV=>Dr McCoy... ZDRASTVUYTE!
BONES=>Hello to you, Chekov.
KIRK=>He's gonna make it!
POLICEMAN=>He? They went in with a she...
KIRK=>One little mistake...
GILLIAN=>If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
KIRK=>Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
GILLIAN=>Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
KIRK=>All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
GILLIAN=>What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
KIRK=>You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
GILLIAN=>What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
KIRK=>I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The frequency.
GILLIAN=>All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
KIRK=>Thank you. For everything. Beam me up, Scotty.
GILLIAN'S VOICE=>Surprise!
KIRK=>Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
SPOCK=>Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
SCOTTY=>I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu?
SULU=>I'm trying to remember how this works. I got used to a Huey.
KIRK=>You tricked me.
GILLIAN=>You need me.
SULU=>Ready sir.
KIRK=>Go, Mr. Sulu.
CHEKOV=>Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
KIRK=>Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
SULU=>Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
KIRK=>Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
SULU=>Three-one-zero, aye!
KIRK=>Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
UHURA=>Scanning, sir!
SULU=>10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
KIRK=>Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
SULU=>Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
KIRK=>Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
SCOTTY=>Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
KIRK'S VOICE=>400 Tons?
SCOTTY=>It ain't just the whales, it's the water.
KIRK=>Yes, of course.
KIRK=>The whales... Any contact?
188C FAVORING SPOCK'S STATION=>188C
BONES=>You, ah... You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
SPOCK=>Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
BONES=>Naturally. So what is your problem?
SPOCK=>Acceleration is no longer a constant.
BONES=>Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
SPOCK=>... Best shot...?
BONES=>Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
SPOCK=>"Guessing" is not in my nature...
BONES=>Well nobody's perfect...
GILLIAN=>That's it! That's it!
UHURA=>Affirmative. Contact with the whales.
KIRK=>Bearing!
UHURA=>Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
KIRK=>Put them on screen!
GILLIAN=>How can you do that?! It's radio!
UHURA=>Image translation on screen!
UHURA=>Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
KIRK=>On screen.
BONES=>What kind of ship is that?
GILLIAN=>A whaling ship, Doctor.
KIRK=>Estimate range, ship to whales!
UHURA=>Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
GILLIAN=>Oh my God, we're too late!
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
SULU=>Dive speed is 200 knots per minute, 3.3. per second. Estimate reaching whales in 1.2 minutes.
SULU=>Range to whales, 30 seconds...
SULU=>10 seconds, sir!
KIRK=>Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up! Mark, Mr. Sulu...
KIRK=>Scotty -- Disengage cloaking device!
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Aye, sir.
KIRK=>Mr. Scott. It's up to you now. Commence build up for transporter beam!
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Give it me best, sir!
SCOTTY=>Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
KIRK=>How long, Scotty?
SCOTTY=>10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
SCOTTY=>Admiral! There be whales here!
KIRK=>Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
SCOTTY=>I'll have to re-energize.
KIRK=>Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems... Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
UHURA=>Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
KIRK=>Mr. Scott -- how soon?
SCOTTY=>Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
KIRK=>Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
SCOTTY=>Full power, sir.
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu, if you please.
SULU=>Aye, sir, warp speed!
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales. Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
SPOCK=>Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will... Make a guess.
KIRK=>You?
SPOCK=>... I don't think he understands...
BONES=>No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
SPOCK=>You're saying... It is a compliment.
BONES=>It is.
SPOCK=>I will try to make the best guess I can.
KIRK=>Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
SCOTTY=>The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
GILLIAN=>A miracle, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY=>... The miracle is yet to come.
KIRK=>He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
GILLIAN=>I belong here. Suppose by some miracle you do get them through. Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
KIRK=>... You have a point...
SCOTTY=>You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
KIRK=>On my way...!
SCOTTY=>Buckle up, Lassie. It gets bumpy from here.
SCOTTY'S VOICE=>Warp seven point five... Seven point nine... Mr. Sulu, that's all I can give ye!
CHEKOV=>Shields at Maximum!
KIRK=>Can we make breakaway speed!?
SPOCK=>Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
SULU=>Warp eight. Eight point one... Maximum speed, sir!
SPOCK=>Admiral, I need thruster control...
KIRK=>Acceleration thrusters at Spock's command...!
SPOCK=>Steady... Steady... Now.
KIRK=>Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
SPOCK=>They did, Admiral.
KIRK=>Then... Where the hell are we?
COMM OFFICER=>Sir... I'm picking up a faint transmission... It's Admiral Kirk calling...!
MORROW=>On screen!
MORROW=>Satellite reserve power, now!
KIRK'S IMAGE=>... Analysis... Probe call... Captain Spock... Opinion... extinct species, Humpback Whale... proper response... Do you read me...?
MORROW=>Stabilize! Emergency reserve!
KIRK=>Starfleet, if you read, we are going to attempt time travel. We are computing our trajectory at this time...
SAREK=>Good luck, Kirk. And all you go with you.
SAREK=>Look!
KIRK=>Spock: Condition report!
SPOCK=>No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
CHEKOV=>The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
KIRK=>Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
SULU=>I have no control, sir!
KIRK=>Picture, Uhura!
KIRK=>Out of control, and blind as a bat!
BONES=>For Godsakes, Jim, where are we...?!
SULU=>Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
KIRK=>Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
KIRK=>Blow the hatch!
KIRK=>You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we sink. Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?! Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
SPOCK=>I will, Admiral.
KIRK=>The whales...?!
SCOTTY=>No power to the bay doors.
KIRK=>The explosive override -- ?
SCOTTY=>It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
KIRK=>Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
SCOTTY=>Admiral, you'll be trapped!
KIRK=>Why don't they answer? Why don't they sing, dammit!
