COWBOY=>Well, the ones I'm ... I'm fighting at are some pretty bad boys. I'm not real keen on ... some of these fellows that are . . . supposed to be on our side. I keep meeting'em coming the other way. Yeah.
DONLON=>I mean, we're getting killed for these people and they don't even appreciate it. They think it's a big joke.
ANIMAL MOTHER=>Well, if you ask me, uh, we're shooting the wrong gooks.
RAFTERMAN=>Well, it depends on the situation. I mean, I'm--I'm here to take combat photos. But if the shit gets too thick, I mean, I'll go to the rifle.
COWBOY=>I hate Vietnam. There's not one horse in this whole country. They don't have one horse in
ANIMAL MOTHER=>Well, if they'd send us more guys and maybe bomb the hell out of the North, they might, uh, they might give up.
