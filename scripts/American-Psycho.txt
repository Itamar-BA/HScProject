TIM=>I'm resourceful. Creative. I'm highly motivated, I'm skilled. In essence what I'm saying is that society cannot afford to lose me. I'm an asset.
TIM=>I mean the fact remains that no one gives a shit about their work, everybody hates their job, you've told me you hate yours. What do we do? Go back to Los Angeles?
TIM=>I hate to complain -- I really do - about the trash, the garbage, the disease, about how filthy this city really is and you know and I know that it is a sty...
PATRICK=>Oh... my... god.
TIM=>In one issue -- in one issue -- let's see here...
PATRICK=>Please... shut up.
TIM=>...strangled models, babies thrown from rooftops, kids killed in the subway, a Communist rally, mafia boss wiped out, Nazis-
TIM=>-baseball players with AIDS, more mafia shit, gridlock, the homeless, various maniacs, faggots dropping like flies in the streets, the cancellation of a soap opera, surrogate mothers... and the joke is, the punch line is, it's all in this city - nowhere else, just here, it sucks, whoa wait, more Nazis, gridlock, baby-sellers, black- market babies, coma baby, hot water burns baby, AIDS babies, bridge collapses-
TIM=>That's the twenty-fourth one I've seen today. I've kept count.
PATRICK=>Timothy Price began his spiel today, hours ago over lunch and has been going non-stop, more or less, ever since. I've mostly been ignoring him, although I did pay attention earlier at Harry's when he began ranting about Paul Owen and the mysterious Fisher account. Tim is an investment banker with Pierce & Pierce. We work in the same office.
TIM=>Why aren't you wearing the worsted navy blue blazer with the gray pants?
PATRICK=>Our destination this evening: Manhattan's Upper West Side - a quiet dinner with Evelyn and Courtney. Tim is twenty-six years old.
TIM=>Diseases! There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected then you can also catch anything, whether it's a virus per se or not - Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, anorexia, autism, dyslexia, for Christ sakes -- you can get dyslexia from pussy-
PATRICK=>I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
TIM=>Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
TIM=>Luis Carruthers... what... a... dick. Smile for the birdie, Luis.
TIM=>I'm leaving. I'm dumping Meredith. I'm gone. Twenty-six, twenty-seven... I mean I tell her I'm sensitive. I told her I was freaked out by the Challenger accident -- what more does she want? I'm ethical, I'm tolerant, I mean I'm extremely satisfied with my life, optimistic about the future-
TIM=>I mean, aren't you?
PATRICK=>Sure, but-
TIM=>And all I get is shit from her.
TIM=>Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, holy shit it's a goddamn cluster of bums. I tell you-
PATRICK=>Should we bring flowers?
TIM=>Nah. Hell, you're banging her, Bateman. Why should we get Evelyn flowers?
PATRICK=>I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn are having an affair.
TIM=>Jesus, Patrick... you should see how ripped my stomach is. The definition. Completely buffed out... ripped.
PATRICK=>Timothy is the only interesting person I know.
COURTNEY=>A bit late, aren't we boys?
TIM=>Inept Haitian cabbie. Do we have reservations somewhere and please don't tell me Pastels at nine.
COURTNEY=>Eating in tonight, darlings. I'm sorry, I know, I know, I tried to talk Evelyn out of it but we're having... sushi.
TIM=>Evelyn? Where are you, Evelyn? We have to talk...
PATRICK=>It's good to see you. You look very pretty tonight. Your face has a youthful... glow.
COURTNEY=>You really know how to charm the ladies, Bateman.
COURTNEY=>Should I tell Evelyn you feel this way?
PATRICK=>No. But I bet you'd like to.
COURTNEY=>Patrick. I think Luis suspects something.
PATRICK=>Like what? That two plus two equals four? That you're secretly Nancy Reagan? Courtney, relax. Luis is... clueless. Blue socks? Grey trousers? Am I making sense here?
COURTNEY=>Patrick, I'm serious. I think we should stop. Besides, you have a girlfriend.
COURTNEY=>Come on.
EVELYN=>Oh honey, I'm sorry. I wanted to go to this darling little new Salvadorian bistro on the Lower East side-
EVELYN=>-but we couldn't get reservations. Timothy, don't groan.
EVELYN=>I don't know. Oh, I'm so unsure. The California Roll should circle the rim of the plate, no?
TIM=>Bateman? Drink?
PATRICK=>J&B. On the rocks.
EVELYN=>Oh god. It's a mess. I swear I'm going to cry.
PATRICK=>The sushi looks marvelous.
EVELYN=>Oh, it's a mess. It's a mess.
PATRICK=>No, no, the sushi looks marvelous.
PATRICK=>Delicious.
TIM=>Bateman?
PATRICK=>Yes? Timothy?
TIM=>You're a dufus.
EVELYN=>Oh leave Patrick alone. He's the boy next door. That's Patrick. You're not a dufus. You're the boy next door, aren't you?
PATRICK=>No I'm not. I'm a fucking evil psychopath.
EVELYN=>Oh so what. We have to eat this now or else we'll all be poisoned.
PATRICK=>What's wrong? For Christ sakes, Price! Help us!
COURTNEY=>What's wrong? Tell me, Evelyn.
EVELYN=>A spider.
COURTNEY=>It's okay, Evelyn. It's just a little spider. Don't be scared.
PATRICK=>Shut up, Price.
EVELYN=>Do something, Patrick.
TIM=>Patrick, do something! Save me!
COURTNEY=>It's delicious.
EVELYN=>Tempura?
PATRICK=>I'll have some.
TIM=>I mean, how can you say that? Don't you know anything about Sri Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of Israelis there? Doesn't that effect us?
PATRICK=>Oh come on, Price. There are more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
TIM=>Like what? By the way, why is there an ice cube in my soy sauce?
PATRICK=>Well, for one thing we have to slow down the nuclear arms race. We must ensure a strong national defense, prevent the spread of Communism, the insidious evil, and work for peace in the Middle East while preventing a U.S. military involvement overseas. We also need to stop terrorism and end world hunger. Now that's not to belittle our domestic problems which are equally important, if not more so.
PATRICK=>We need better and more affordable care for the elderly. We need to control and find a cure for the AIDS epidemic and we need to improve the quality of education. We also have to crack down on crime and illegal drugs.
PATRICK=>But economically we're still a mess. We have to find a way to hold down the inflation rate and reduce the deficit. We also need to provide training and jobs for the unemployed as well as protect existing American jobs from unfair foreign imports. We have to make America the leader by promoting economic growth and business expansion.
PATRICK=>But let's not ignore our social needs, oh no! We, as a society, are obligated to provide food and shelter for those who are unable to provide for themselves, however we must stop people from abusing the welfare system. We must unite in our fight against racial inequality and celebrate the diversity of this great nation. The abortion laws must be changed to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice. But before any of this can happen, we must encourage a return to traditional moral values, curbing graphic sex and violence on T.V., in movies, in popular music, everywhere. Most importantly, we must promote general social concern and less materialism in young people.
EVELYN=>Would anyone like dessert?
PATRICK=>What's going on with Courtney and Luis?
EVELYN=>Oh god. The really dreadful thing about Courtney is not that she doesn't like Luis anymore. It's that she's really in love with her real estate broker. Are you gaining weight?
PATRICK=>Jesus. No, Evelyn.
EVELYN=>Your face definitely looks rounder. Less chiseled.
PATRICK=>Why don't you just go for Price?
EVELYN=>Oh god, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
PATRICK=>He's rich.
EVELYN=>Everybody's rich.
PATRICK=>He's good-looking.
EVELYN=>Everybody's good-looking.
PATRICK=>He has a great body.
EVELYN=>Everybody has a great body.
EVELYN=>You know, you can always be in better shape.
EVELYN=>Your hairline looks like it's receding. Are you using Minoxidil?
PATTY WINTERS=>Well, is it schizophrenia or what's the deal? Tell us.
WOMAN=>No, oh no. Multiple personalities are not schizophrenics. We are not dangerous.
PATTY WINTERS=>Well... who were you last month?
WOMAN=>Last month it seemed to be mostly Polly.
PATTY WINTERS=>Now who are you?
WOMAN=>Well... well, this month I'm... Lambchop. Mostly... Lambchop.
PATRICK=>The universal all-directional shower head adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It's made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with white enamel finish.
PATRICK=>I begin with a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sasson shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh hair down and flatten it to the scalp, making you look older. The conditioner is also good.
PATRICK=>Before shaving, I always press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I slather on a moisturizer and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply shaving cream over it -- preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers, making hair removal easier. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never, ever use cologne on your face since the alcohol content will dry your skin out and make you look older. Applying a moisturizer is the final step. If the face seems dry and flaky -- which can make it look dull and older -- use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin. Then apply anti-aging eye balm.
FALLOW=>Did Sherman McCoy kill Henry Lamb? How well do you know Mr. McCoy? Is there anything you'd like to say to the dead boy's family?
FALLOW=>Our streets flow red with the blood of the innocent. What do you say to that, Mr. Wall Street?
FALLOW=>Someone will pay!
JEAN=>Good morning, Patrick.
PATRICK=>What a good morning it is, Jean.
PATRICK=>Did you see the Patty Winters Show this morning?
JEAN=>No. How was it?
PATRICK=>I don't remember... I think I was hallucinating while watching it... I can't be sure. I really don't know.
PATRICK=>Any messages?
JEAN=>Charlie Babbitt has to cancel today. He didn't say what it was he is canceling or why.
PATRICK=>Charlie imports sports cars... I'm thinking of buying one from him. Anyone else?
JEAN=>Doug Coughlin called. He wants to meet you for a drink tonight.
PATRICK=>When?
JEAN=>After six.
PATRICK=>No can do, Jean. Cancel it.
JEAN=>Oh? And what should I say?
PATRICK=>Just... say... no.
JEAN=>Just say no?
PATRICK=>Is there an echo in here? I could swear I just heard an echo. You'd better check it out. Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
JEAN=>Yes, sir.
PATRICK=>Oh wait... and I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight tonight.
JEAN=>Oh, something... romantic?
PATRICK=>No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
JEAN=>I'll do it.
PATRICK=>No, no. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
JEAN=>You look nice today.
VOICE=>Hello Patrick.
PATRICK=>Mr. Trump... this is a... surprise.
TRUMP=>Please. My friends call me Don.
PATRICK=>Don, I'm a real... I'm a huge fan of yours...
TRUMP=>That's great Patrick. I see you have my book.
PATRICK=>It's like, my bible.
TRUMP=>I'm a rich man. Did you know that, Patrick?
PATRICK=>Ummm... yes... yes I did.
TRUMP=>You and me, we're a lot alike, Patrick. People think I have everything... people say, Oh Donald Trump, what more could he possibly want?
PATRICK=>Well... umm...
TRUMP=>All my life I've wanted only one thing. A secretary like Jean. You're a lucky man, Patrick. Be good to her.
JEAN=>Patrick? Patrick? Here's your Perrier...
JEAN=>You have a reservation at Camols at twelve-thirty, non-smoking section. I brought you the Ransom file... Patrick? Is something wrong?
PATRICK=>Don't wear that outfit again.
PATRICK=>Sitting in Harry's with Craig McDermott and David Van Patten, tonight's topic of conversation is familiar: fashion do's and don'ts.
CRAIG=>Here's my question: is it proper to wear tasseled loafers with a business suit or not?
PATRICK=>Inseparable since birth, David and Craig have an on-going bet to see who will get in the Question and Answer column of GQ Magazine first.
CRAIG=>Don't look at me like I'm insane.
PATRICK=>Well guys... The tasseled loafer is traditionally a casual shoe...
CRAIG=>But it's become acceptable just because it's so popular, right?
PATRICK=>Yeah. As long as it's either black or cordovan it's okay.
DAVID=>What about brown?
PATRICK=>Too sporty for a business suit.
TIM=>What are you fags talking about? Luis Carruthers is here.
PATRICK=>Where? Where?
TIM=>Over at the bar. Go say 'hi'.
PATRICK=>I honestly don't know what Courtney sees in this guy. I mean, look at his suit, for Christsake.
DAVID=>Okay, okay. This is my question. A two-parter: are rounded collars too dressy or too casual? Part two, which tie knot looks best with them?
TIM=>It's a very versatile look, David. It can go with both suits and sports coats. It should be starched for dressy occasions and a collar pin should be worn if it's particularly formal. With a blazer it can be worn either pinned or unpinned. You want the collar to look soft. Since it's a traditional preppy look it's best if balanced by a relatively small four-in -hand knot. Next question?
CRAIG=>Buy the man a drink.
DAVID=>Price?
TIM=>Yes?
DAVID=>You're priceless.
CRAIG=>Hey Price. You got a question for GQ?
TIM=>Yeah, I do. If all of your friends are morons, is it a felony, a misdemeanor or an act of God if you blow their fucking heads off with a thirty-eight magnum?
CRAIG=>Not GQ material. Try Soldier of Fortune.
DAVID=>Or Vanity Fair.
TIM=>Who is that? Is that David Shawn?
CRAIG=>No. That's Nigel Morrison.
TIM=>Ahhh... one of those British faggots serving internship at-
TIM=>They're all faggots. The British.
DAVID=>How would you know, Timothy?
TIM=>I saw him fuck Bateman up the ass in the men's room at Morgan Stanley.
PATRICK=>When are we going to Tunnel?
DAVID=>What in the fuck is Morrison wearing? Is that really a glen-plaid suit with a checkered shirt?
TIM=>That's not Morrison.
DAVID=>Who is it then?
TIM=>That's Paul Owen.
PATRICK=>That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the bar. Over there.
CRAIG=>He's handling the Fisher account.
PATRICK=>Lucky bastard.
DAVID=>Lucky Jew bastard.
PATRICK=>Oh Jesus, Van Patten.
PATRICK=>What does that have to do with anything?
DAVID=>Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office, on the phone, spinning a fucking menorah.
PATRICK=>You spin a dreidel, David. Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.
TIM=>Oh my god, Bateman. What's your problem?
PATRICK=>Just cool it with the anti-Semetic remarks.
TIM=>The voice of reason. The boy next door.
PATRICK=>Yeah, a boy next door who, according to you, let a British finance intern sodomize him up the ass.
TIM=>I said you were the voice of reason. I didn't say you weren't a homosexual.
DAVID=>Or redundant.
TIM=>Patrick.
PATRICK=>What?
TIM=>Patrick, do you remember your first blow job?
PATRICK=>No, Price. I don't. Of course I do.
TIM=>Did you spit or swallow?
TIM=>Look who approaches. Watch me act thrilled.
TIM=>Hey, Buddie boy, how you doin'?
BUD=>Great Tim, any better it'd be a sin.
CRAIG=>Still seeing that sexy French chick?
BUD=>No. She asked the wrong question.
DAVID=>What was that?
BUD=>"What are you thinking?" Having sex with her was like reading the Wall Street Journal.
TIM=>She had a heartbeat.
BUD=>Wanna bet?
CRAIG=>So what? I'd fuck her.
TIM=>Buddie, Buddie... Mr. McDermott wants sloppy seconds.
CRAIG=>I don't care. She is beautiful. I want to fuck her. I want to marry her. I want her to have my children.
BUD=>Oh wait, guys, listen, I got a joke.
TIM=>Bud Fox, you are a joke. By the way, nice jacket... non-matching but complementary.
BUD=>Ouch. Price, that really hurts... anyway, what do you call a black investment banker?
TIM=>I don't know... what do you call a black investment banker?
BUD=>A nigger.
PATRICK=>Oh Christ. That's awful.
BUD=>Why? It's funny. It's humorous.
CRAIG=>Yeah, Bateman. Cheer up.
TIM=>For Christ sakes, Bateman. What bothers you about that?
PATRICK=>It's not funny. It's racist.
BUD=>Bateman, you are some kind of morose bastard. You really should lighten up, stop reading all those serial killer biographies. Who was it last week? Ted Bundy? Son of Sam?
TIM=>Don't you know, Buddie? Patrick can't read. He doesn't know how, do you Patrick?
PATRICK=>Fuck both of you. Racist assholes.
BUD=>Listen men, I'm off. Will see you tomorrow.
DAVID=>Yeah... same Bat Time, same Bat Channel.
TIM=>What a fucking loser... they should throw his ass in jail.
PATRICK=>Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
DAVID=>Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
PATRICK=>No. Serial killer. Wisconsin, in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
TIM=>Oh Christ, Bateman. I don't want to hear this.
DAVID=>Go on, Patrick. What did Ed say?
PATRICK=>He said, When I see a pretty girl walking down the street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat her right.
DAVID=>And what does the other part of him think?
PATRICK=>What her head would look like on a stick. Are we going to Tunnel or not?
PATRICK=>This is what I call a target rich environment.
TIM=>New Jersey's finest.
DAVID=>You live your life between your legs, Pat.
PATRICK=>Van Patten, even you could get laid in a place like this.
DAVID=>I'm telling you, I'd be happy to find a girl who'd talk dirty to me.
CRAIG=>I worry about disease just walking into this place. These are some skanky chicks.
DAVID=>I told you, dude, white guys can't get AIDS.
PATRICK=>Tim only manages to get two VIP basement passes. At first this pisses me off but then it occurs to me that Tim is probably planning to ditch Craig and David at some point this evening so I don't have a panic attack about it or anything.
PATRICK=>Goodbye, gentlemen.
PATRICK=>Predictably, Price wants to find some Bolivian Marching Powder and though I'm not really in the mood for cocaine tonight, I don't really protest. What the hell, I'm thinking. This is the Eighties.
PATRICK=>Don't leave home without it.
PATRICK=>Easy, killer... easy.
PATRICK=>Hey, I'm going out with Courtney tomorrow night.
TIM=>Great.
PATRICK=>Well, why not? Luis is out of town.
TIM=>Might as well hire someone from an escort service.
PATRICK=>Why?
TIM=>Because she's gonna cost you a lot more to get laid.
PATRICK=>No way.
TIM=>Listen, I put up with it too.
PATRICK=>Price? You're priceless...
TIM=>Where do those tracks go?
PATRICK=>I don't know.
PATRICK=>Aren't you high?
TIM=>I'm leaving -- I'm getting out.
PATRICK=>Leaving what?
TIM=>This!
PATRICK=>Don't. I'll drink it.
TIM=>Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
PATRICK=>Where to?
TIM=>I'm leaving! I am leaving!
PATRICK=>Well, where are you going?
TIM=>Away!
PATRICK=>Don't tell me. Merchant banking?
TIM=>No, Bateman. I'm serious, you dumb son-of-a-bitch. Leaving. Disappearing.
PATRICK=>Where to? Rehab? Where?
PATRICK=>I need a drink. Price, I'm going to the bar. Do you want something?
PATRICK=>Price, do you-
TIM=>Good bye, Bateman.
DAVID=>Skanky chicks. Beware. No hardbodies.
CRAIG=>Basement sucks.
DAVID=>Did you find drugs?
PATRICK=>No. Negative. Couldn't find any.
TIM=>GOODBYE!
TIM=>FUCKHEADS!
PATRICK=>PRICE!
CRAIG=>Does Price know about a secret VIP room?
WOMAN=>I'm coming, oh god, I'm coming.
PATRICK=>No. Don't.
WOMAN=>But you have an ash-
PATRICK=>Smoking is a filthy habit. Do not smoke in my apartment or around me.
PATRICK=>I think you should go home.
PATRICK=>I think I might... hurt you. I don't think I can control myself.
WOMAN=>Okay. Sure.
WOMAN=>I don't want to get too involved anyway.
PATRICK=>I think something bad is going to happen.
WOMAN=>I understand.
PATRICK=>You don't want to get hurt, do you?
WOMAN=>That's why I'm leaving.
PATRICK=>I think I'm losing it.
PATRICK=>The private health club I belong to is located four blocks from my apartment on the Upper West Side. Membership runs five thousand dollars annually.
PATRICK=>My fitness program incorporates both aerobic exercises and weight training. On the leg machines I do five sets of ten repetitions. For the back I also do five sets of ten repetitions. On the stomach crunch machine I've gotten so I can do six sets of fifteen and on the biceps curl machines I do seven sets of ten. This is followed by twenty minutes on the exercise bike.
PATRICK=>Using the free weights I do three sets of fifteen repetitions each of leg extensions, leg curls and leg presses followed by three sets and twenty repetitions of barbell curls, bent- over lateral raises, pulley rows, dead lifts, and bent-over barbell rows. For the chest I do three sets of twenty reps of incline-bench presses.
PATRICK=>The Patty Winters Show this morning was about UFOs That Kill.
EVELYN=>Gregory's graduating from Saint Paul soon and will be attending Columbia in September. I've got to get him a graduation present and I'm at a total loss. Any suggestions, hon?
PATRICK=>A poster from Les Miserables?
EVELYN=>Perfect.
PATRICK=>I have no idea who Gregory is. You do know that, right?
EVELYN=>Mr. Bateman. I really like you. I adore your sense of humor. Ha ha ha.
PATRICK=>I am sitting in a restaurant with Evelyn this evening because she caught me on call waiting while I was on the other line trying to secure a reservation at Dorsia which I had planned to use with Courtney.
EVELYN=>Anyway, I was going to tell you what happened to Melania and Taylor and --
EVELYN=>-- stop looking at my chest, Patrick.
EVELYN=>Now anyway, Taylor Grassgreen and Melania were... you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar. Her father owns all those banks in Dallas? And Taylor went to Cornell... anyway, they were supposed to meet --
PATRICK=>I keep studying Evelyn's face, bored by how beautiful it is, flawless really, and I think to myself how strange it is that she has pulled me through so much; how she's always been there when I needed her the most. Our waitress, a total hardbody, flirts with me every time she passes by our table. The thought of fucking her crosses my mind and though I conclude the odds are in my favor, it's... just... not... worth it. The boxer shorts I am wearing cost sixty dollars.
EVELYN=>-- at the Cornell Club and then they had a reservation at Mondrian at seven and he was wearing... no. Le Cygne. They were going to Le Cygne and Taylor was... oh god, it was Mondrian. Mondrian at seven and he was wearing a Piero Dimitri suit. Melania had been shopping... I think she'd been to Bergdorf's, though I'm not positive - but anyway, oh yes, it was Bergdorf's because she was wearing the scarf at the office the other day... so anyway, she hadn't been to her aerobics class for something like two days and they were mugged on one-
PATRICK=>Dinner with Evelyn is a chore, an obstacle for me to overcome, however, today has not been that bad...
PATRICK=>After a two hour workout at Xclusive, I stopped by an automated teller machine where just for the hell of it I withdrew another hundred dollars, feeling better about having an even five hundred in my wallet.
PATRICK=>Later in the afternoon I found myself wandering around VideoVisions, the video rental store I go to on the Upper West Side. Membership costs only two hundred dollars annually. I wanted to rent some pornographic videos, but because the store was more crowded than usual, I was forced to browse... but there were too many fucking movies to choose from.
PATRICK=>Feeling ripped off I settled for a Woody Allen movie but... I still wasn't satisfied. Then, almost by rote, as if I'd been programmed, I reached for Body Double, a movie I have rented thirty-seven times.
PATRICK=>On Evelyn's request, I stopped at a hardware store on Amsterdam to purchase something for her insect problem.
PATRICK=>Let's see what they say about this one... They tell you what it's ingredients are... and how it's guaranteed to exterminate every insect in the world. But they do not tell you whether or not it's painless. And I say insect or man, death should always be painless.
PATRICK=>In addition to the insecticide, I purchased a nail gun and a power saw, both by Black and Decker. On impulse I also bought twenty feet of barbed wire.
PATRICK=>This was followed by a very tense scene at my dry cleaners.
PATRICK=>Listen, wait... You're not... shhh... What are you trying to say to me?
PATRICK=>If-you-don't-shut-your-fucking-mouth- I-will-kill-you-are-you-understanding- me?
PATRICK=>Listen. I cannot understand you.
PATRICK=>What? You didn't hear me? You want some ham? Is that what you just said? You want... some ham? Oh Christ. You... are... a... fool!
PATRICK=>On top of everything else today, the woman who lives in the brownstone next to Evelyn's was found murdered last night. So far there are no suspects.
EVELYN=>We should do it.
PATRICK=>Do what?
EVELYN=>Oh Patrick. Let's get married.
PATRICK=>Yeah... and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have lots of laughs. Are you proposing to me, Evelyn?
EVELYN=>Weddings are so romantic... a diamond engagement ring. You know, Patrick, I won't settle for less. It has to be diamond.
PATRICK=>Evelyn seems to be holding up relatively well this evening considering the fact that her neighbor's head is in my freezer.
EVELYN=>What would we wear?
PATRICK=>I would demand to wear Ray-Ban sunglasses. In fact I would demand that everyone would have to wear Ray-Ban sunglasses.
EVELYN=>I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd want. A zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something to shock daddy.
PATRICK=>I'd want to bring a Harrison AK-47 assault rifle to the ceremony so after thoroughly blowing your fat mother's head off with it I could use it on that fag brother of yours. And though I personally don't like to use anything the Soviets designed, I don't know, the Harrison somehow reminds me of... Stoli?
EVELYN=>Oh and lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters. Oysters on the half shell. Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibowitz. We'll get Annie Leibowitz! And we'll hire someone to videotape it!
PATRICK=>Or an AR-15. You'd like it, Evelyn: it's the most expensive of guns but worth every penny.
EVELYN=>Patrick, I can't wait. I'm so excited.
PATRICK=>I never knew you smoked.
COURTNEY=>You never noticed.
PATRICK=>Okay, I admit I'm embarrassed, but just a little.
COURTNEY=>Listen, Patrick. Can we talk?
PATRICK=>There's nothing to say, Courtney. You look marvelous. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no less.
COURTNEY=>Isn't that special?
PATRICK=>Read my lips. You look marvelous.
COURTNEY=>Patrick?
PATRICK=>Yes, Courtney?
COURTNEY=>Nothing.
PATRICK=>My watch has stopped so I'm not sure what time it is. I guess it's probably ten thirty or so. My mind is a mess. I don't know what to think or how to feel. The Patty Winters Show
PATRICK=>this morning was about the possibility of nuclear war, and according to a panel of experts the odds are pretty good it will happen sometime within the next month. The videotapes I forgot to return this evening will cost me a small fortune in late fees.
PATRICK=>Hi. Pat Bateman.
PATRICK=>You want some money? Some... food?
PATRICK=>Is this what you want?
BUM=>I'm so hungry.
PATRICK=>It's cold out, too. Isn't it?
BUM=>I'm so hungry.
PATRICK=>Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
BUM=>I lost my job...
PATRICK=>Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really - were you drinking on the job?
BUM=>I was fired. I was laid off.
PATRICK=>Gee, uh, that's too bad.
BUM=>I'm so hungry.
PATRICK=>I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
BUM=>I'm hungry.
PATRICK=>Listen. Do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? Who do work?
BUM=>What am I gonna do?
PATRICK=>Listen. What's your name?
BUM=>Al.
PATRICK=>Speak up. Come on.
BUM=>Al.
PATRICK=>Get a goddamned job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
BUM=>You're so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
PATRICK=>Shhh... it's okay.
BUM=>Please. I don't know what to do. I'm so cold.
PATRICK=>Do you know how bad you smell? My god...
BUM=>I can't... I can't find a shelter.
PATRICK=>You reek. You reek of... shit. Do you know that? Goddamnit, Al - look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot.
PATRICK=>Al... I'm sorry. It's just that... I don't know. I don't have anything in common with you.
PATRICK=>Do you know what a fucking loser you are?
PATRICK=>There's a quarter. Go buy some gum you crazy fucking nigger.
PATRICK=>I am sitting with Craig Van Patten and David McDermott in the dining room of the Yale Club, having lunch. Since the three of us have taken the rest of the afternoon off, we're all getting massages.
PATRICK=>Van Patten is wearing a glen-plaid wool-crepe suit from Krizia Uomo, a Brooks Brothers shirt, a tie from Adirondack and shoes by Cole-Haan. McDermott is wearing a lamb's wool and cashmere blazer, worsted wool flannel trousers by Ralph Lauren, a shirt and tie also by Ralph Lauren and shoes from Brooks Brothers. I'm wearing a tick-weave wool suit with a windowpane overplaid, a cotton shirt by Luciano Barbera, shoes from Cole-Haan and nonprescription glasses by Bausch & Lomb.
PATRICK=>Luis Carruthers is sitting five tables away. He's wearing an unidentifiable suit from some French tailor and he keeps looking over here, trying to get my attention.
DAVID=>What are the rules for wearing a sweater vest?
PATRICK=>David's question looms over the table, filling me with a nameless dread.
CRAIG=>What do you mean?
PATRICK=>Yes. Clarify.
DAVID=>Well, is it strictly informal-
PATRICK=>Or can it be worn with a suit?
DAVID=>Exactly.
PATRICK=>Well, according to Bruce Boyer-
DAVID=>Wait. Is he with Morgan Stanley?
PATRICK=>No. He's not with Morgan Stanley.
CRAIG=>Wasn't he a serial killer? Don't tell me he was another serial killer, Bateman. Not another serial killer.
PATRICK=>No, McDufus, he wasn't a serial killer. That really pisses me off.
CRAIG=>But you always bring them up. And always in this casual, educational sort of way. I mean, I don't want to know anything about Son of Sam or the fucking Hillside Strangler or, or... Featherhead, for god sake.
DAVID=>Featherhead? Who's Featherhead? He sounds exceptionally dangerous.
PATRICK=>He means Leatherface. Leatherface. He was part of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
DAVID=>Oh. Of course.
PATRICK=>And he was exceptionally dangerous.
CRAIG=>And now okay, go on. Bruce Boyer, what did he do? Let's see -- skin them alive? Starve them to death? Run them over? Feed them to dogs? What?
PATRICK=>You guys. He did something far worse.
PATRICK=>He was the author of Elegance: A Guide to Quality in Menswear. And no, Craig, he wasn't a serial killer in his spare time.
CRAIG=>What did Brucie baby have to say?
PATRICK=>You're a clod. It's an excellent book. His theory remains we shouldn't feel restricted from wearing a sweater vest with a suit. Did you hear me call you a clod?
CRAIG=>Yeah.
DAVID=>But doesn't he point out that a vest shouldn't overpower the suit?
PATRICK=>Yes... With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would call for a bolder vest.
CRAIG=>And remember, with a regular vest the last button should be left undone.
PATRICK=>I thought you hadn't read this... this book. You just told me you couldn't tell the difference between Bruce Boyer... and John Wayne Gacy.
CRAIG=>It came back to me.
PATRICK=>Listen. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look too studied.
DAVID=>You think so?
PATRICK=>You'll look like you consciously worked for this look. Featherhead? How in the hell did you get Featherhead from Leatherface?
CRAIG=>Ah, cheer up, Bateman.
DAVID=>Yeah, buddy. Don't worry, be happy.
PATRICK=>Listen. I just want everyone to know that I'm pro family and anti-drug. Excuse me, gentlemen.
DAVID=>Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water. Bring me an Evian or something, okay?
PATRICK=>One of the many questions I must now face: Would Courtney spend more time with me - the time she now spends with Luis - if he was out of the picture, no longer an alternative... if he was perhaps... dead?
LUIS=>God, Patrick. Why here?
LUIS=>I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.
LUIS=>Don't be shy.
LUIS=>You don't know how long I've wanted it...
LUIS=>I want you... ...too.
JEAN=>Patrick Bateman's office, may I help you?
PATRICK=>Jean? Hello, Jean?
JEAN=>Patrick? Is that you?
PATRICK=>Oh my god.
JEAN=>Patrick, what's wrong?
PATRICK=>Jean, I'm not going to make it... I'm not going to... make it... to the office this afternoon.
JEAN=>What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
PATRICK=>Stop sounding so fucking... sad. Jesus.
JEAN=>Patrick, I'm sorry. I mean I meant to say-
PATRICK=>OH GOD!
PATRICK=>I've got to return my videotapes, I've got to return my videotapes, I've got-
PATRICK=>Listen. I have a reservation. Bateman. Where's the maitre d'? I know Jackie Mason.
WOMAN=>I can seat you... don't need a reservation.
PATRICK=>Is this a goddamn joke?
PATRICK=>A cheeseburger. I'd like a cheeseburger and I'd like it medium rare.
WOMAN=>I'm sorry, sir. No cheese. Kosher.
PATRICK=>Fine. A kosherburger but with cheese, Monterey Jack perhaps, and - oh god.
WOMAN=>No cheese, sir. Kosher-
PATRICK=>What in the fuck is going on?
WOMAN=>I'll get the manager-
PATRICK=>No, wait! Bring me a beverage. Bring me a fucking... vanilla... milkshake. EXTRA THICK!
PATRICK=>Days pass. I don't know how many. December arrives without warning.
PATRICK=>My priorities before Christmas include the following: to get an eight o' clock reservation on a Friday night at Dorsia, to find out as much as humanly possible about Paul Owen's mysterious Fisher account, to get myself invited to Donald Trump's Christmas party and to apologize to Evelyn without making it look like an apology.
PATRICK=>There are many presents that I still need to buy and though I could have sent my secretary Jean to make these purchases, I feel prepared to deal with this myself thanks to a vigorous two hour workout at my private health club on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
PATRICK=>Paisley ties and crystal water pitchers, tumbler sets and office clocks that measure temperature, humidity and barometric pressure, electric calling card address books and margarita glasses, sets of dessert plates and correspondence cards, mirrors and shower clocks and aprons and hand-knitted cotton snowflake sweaters. Porsche-design ski goggles and diamond earrings. Vodka glasses, cameras, aftershaves, salt and pepper shakers, aluminum lunch pails and shoe horns that cost two hundred dollars.
PATRICK=>Some kind of existential chasm opens before me in Bloomingdale's, filling me with a nameless dread.
PATRICK=>A Xanax fails to ward off the panic. Saks Fifth Avenue intensifies it...
PATRICK=>Pens and photo albums, electric shoe polishers and heated towel stands. Portable palm-sized color TVs with earphones, birdhouses, ice buckets, jewelry boxes and scarves, pillow cases, foreign-currency-exchange minicalculators, and diamond earrings. Two hundred dollar shoe horns and customized tennis balls and--
PATRICK=>In the weeks leading up to Christmas, my presence will be required at many, many cocktail parties -- the majority of which I would rather not attend. The first of them... and by far the worst, is tonight.
EVELYN=>Mistletoe alert!
EVELYN=>Merry Xmas, Patrick.
PATRICK=>Merry... Xmas.
EVELYN=>You're late, honey.
PATRICK=>No, Evelyn, darling. I'm not late.
EVELYN=>Oh yes you are.
PATRICK=>I've been here. You just didn't see me.
EVELYN=>Oh, stop scowling. You're such a Grinch.
PATRICK=>Bah humbug.
EVELYN=>How's the Waldorf salad? Do you think it tastes alright?
GUEST=>Great party, Evelyn.
EVELYN=>Are you sure? Are you having a good time? Did you try the Waldorf salad?
PATRICK=>Delicious.
EVELYN=>But Mr. Grinch was late. And not a word about that damn Waldorf salad.
PATRICK=>You know, Evelyn, there were a lot of other Xmas parties in this metropolis that I could have attended tonight yet I chose yours. Why? you might ask. Why? I asked myself. I didn't come up with a feasible answer, yet I'm here, so be, you know, grateful, babe.
EVELYN=>Oh, so this is my Christmas present? How sweet Patrick, how thoughtful.
PATRICK=>No, this is. Here.
EVELYN=>Oh Patrick, I'm going to cry. It's gorgeous. Can I put it on now?
PATRICK=>No. Feed it to one of the... midgets.
EVELYN=>Oh, Patrick. They're elves. Christmas elves. Santa's helpers. God, what a sourpuss. Look at them. They're adorable. That one over there is Rudolph, the one passing out candy is Blitzen. The other one is Donner-
PATRICK=>Wait a minute, Evelyn, wait. I... those are the names of reindeer. Not elves. Blitzen was a reindeer.
EVELYN=>Oh... is this true?
PATRICK=>Yes, Evelyn... I distinctly remember Blitzen being a reindeer, not an elf.
EVELYN=>Oh, so what. Don't you think it's Christmasy?
PATRICK=>You're absolutely right, Evelyn. I couldn't agree with you more. It's very Christmasy. Excuse me. I need another drink.
EVELYN=>Is that Michael J. Fox over there?
PATRICK=>Oh... my... god.
PATRICK=>Owen!
PAUL=>Marcus! Merry Christmas! How've you been? Workaholic, I suppose.
PATRICK=>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
PAUL=>We just got back from the Bahamas. Meredith insisted that I take her, so what could I do?
PATRICK=>Paul Owen apparently thinks that I'm someone named Marcus Halberstam which I guess is understandable since Marcus and I both pretty much look the same. Marcus also works at P&P, in fact doing the same exact thing I do. Being mistaken for Marcus doesn't really me bother all that much except for when I accidentally get sent his junk mail and I have to spend hours tracking him down. That gets to be a real fucking nuisance.
PATRICK=>Are you still handling the Fisher account?
PAUL=>Yeah. Lucked out, huh, Marcus?
PATRICK=>You sure did. Wow...
PAUL=>We're going to Nell's later. Limo's waiting out front.
PATRICK=>We should have lunch.
PAUL=>Yes, that would be great. Maybe you could bring...
PATRICK=>Shit. Who is Marcus dating? What is her fucking name?
PATRICK=>Cecelia?
PAUL=>Yes. Cecelia.
PATRICK=>Oh, Cecelia would... adore it.
PAUL=>Well, let's do it.
PATRICK=>Yes. We could go to... Le Bernardin for some... seafood perhaps? Hmmm?
PAUL=>Le Bernardin is in Zagat's top ten this year. You know that? Sea urchins. Meredith loves the sea urchins there.
PATRICK=>Oh does she?
PAUL=>Meredith! Come here.
PATRICK=>She's here?
PAUL=>She's talking to Cecelia over there. Meredith!
MEREDITH=>Yes boys? What are you two talking about? Making up Christmas lists?
PAUL=>The sea urchins at Le Bernardin, darling.
MEREDITH=>To die for. Simply to die for.
PATRICK=>Really? To die for?
MEREDITH=>They're absolutely fabulous.
EVELYN=>What does everyone think of the Waldorf salad? Did you like it?
PAUL=>Cecelia, darling, I haven't tried it yet... but I'd like to know why there are midgets serving eggnog.
EVELYN=>Those aren't midgets! Those are Christmas elves. Patrick, what did you tell him?
PATRICK=>Nothing, Cecelia!
EVELYN=>Oh, Patrick. You're the Grinch.
PATRICK=>Mistletoe alert!
EVELYN=>Oh Patrick-
PATRICK=>Cecelia! Come here at once. Excuse us. We have to talk to that elf and get this all straightened out.
EVELYN=>I'm so sorry.
EVELYN=>Patrick what is going on?
EVELYN=>Patrick? What are we doing in the kitchen?
PATRICK=>Listen. Let's get out of here.
EVELYN=>Oh Patrick. I can't just leave. Aren't you having a good time?
PATRICK=>Why can't you leave? You've been here long enough.
EVELYN=>Patrick, this is my Christmas party. Besides, the elves are going to sing 'O Tannenbaum' any minute now.
PATRICK=>Come on, Evelyn. Let's get out of here. I want to take you away from all this.
EVELYN=>From all what? You didn't like the Waldorf Salad, did you?
PATRICK=>Let's go. Be daring. For just once in your life, Evelyn, be daring. Come on... let this be my Christmas present.
EVELYN=>Oh no, I was already at Brooks Brothers and-
PATRICK=>Stop it. Come on, I want this.
PATRICK=>Mrs. Bateman?
EVELYN=>Oh Patrick.
EVELYN=>Patrick. This is so naughty. And a limo-
PATRICK=>Hi. Pat Bateman. Pat Bateman. What, ah, what is it?
PATRICK=>Oh Jesus, whoa!
PATRICK=>So, Pat Bateman.
DRIVER=>Uh, yeah? Sid.
PATRICK=>Listen, Sid. Mr. Owen says we can take this car, so...
DRIVER=>Who's Mr. Owen?
PATRICK=>Paul Owen. You know. Your customer.
DRIVER=>No. This is Mr. Barker's limo. Nice antlers, though.
PATRICK=>Shit.
EVELYN=>Patrick, darling, I love it. Champagne -- and truffles, too.
PATRICK=>Wrong limo -- take the truffles.
PATRICK=>Hi. Pat Bateman.
SECOND DRIVER=>Yeah? Hi. Donald Trump. My wife Ivana's in the back.
PATRICK=>Hey, watch it. Listen, Mr. Owen says we can take his car. I'm... oh damn, I mean Marcus.
SECOND DRIVER=>You just said your name was Pat.
PATRICK=>No. I was wrong. I was wrong about my name being Pat. My name is Marcus. Marcus Halberstam.
SECOND DRIVER=>Now you're sure of this, right?
PATRICK=>Listen, Mr. Owen said I can take his car for the night, so... you know, let's just get on with it.
SECOND DRIVER=>I think I should talk to Mr. Owen first.
PATRICK=>No, wait! Listen, I'm... it's fine, really. Mr. Owen is in a very, very bad mood.
SECOND DRIVER=>I'm not supposed to do this. No way. Forget about it.
PATRICK=>Oh come on, man.
SECOND DRIVER=>It's totally against company regulations.
PATRICK=>Fuck company regulations.
SECOND DRIVER=>Fuck company regulations?
PATRICK=>Mr. Owen says it's-
SECOND DRIVER=>Listen, mister.
PATRICK=>Marcus.
PATRICK=>Let me put it this way... they've got midgets in there. Midgets who are about to sing 'O Tannenbaum'... do you know how scary that is? Elves harmonizing?
PATRICK=>I'm sorry. I just don't think I can leave until I get just a little compassion from you.
PATRICK=>Shit. Here's a hundred.
SECOND DRIVER=>Two hundred.
PATRICK=>This city sucks.
SECOND DRIVER=>Where to?
PATRICK=>What... what did I do?
EVELYN=>Oh Patrick. It's lovely. I don't know what to say.
PATRICK=>Well... I don't either.
EVELYN=>Help me put it on, darling. You're not the Grinch, honey.
PATRICK=>Uh, Evelyn.
EVELYN=>It's lovely, oh I love it...
PATRICK=>But... that's not...
EVELYN=>What? What are you saying? Oh, honey, you have something else for me?
PATRICK=>No, I mean-
EVELYN=>Come on, you devil. You've got something else. Let me guess. A ring to match? A matching bracelet? A brooch? So that's it! It's a matching brooch.
PATRICK=>My luck could be worse. It really could.
EVELYN=>Patrick, where are you taking me?
PATRICK=>It's hip. It's totally hip.
EVELYN=>Have you ever been there?
PATRICK=>Millions of times.
EVELYN=>Where honey, tell me.
PATRICK=>It's a surprise.
EVELYN=>Chernoble? No, not Chernoble. Honey, it's Christmas.
PATRICK=>What in the hell does that mean?
EVELYN=>I don't understand why you have to ruin this time of year for me. Oh Patrick, please. Honey, it's Christmas.
PATRICK=>You keep saying that as if it meant something. Where would you like me to take you, Evelyn? The Rainbow Room?
EVELYN=>Oh why not, Patrick? They have the best Waldorf Salad in town at the Rainbow Room. Did you like mine? Did you like my Waldorf Salad, honey?
PATRICK=>Oh my god. Why wasn't Donald Trump invited to your party?
EVELYN=>Not Donald Trump again. This obsession of yours has got to end! That's why you were acting like such an ass.
PATRICK=>It was the Waldorf Salad, Evelyn. It was the Waldorf Salad that was making me act like an ass!
EVELYN=>Oh my god. You mean it, too! I knew it. I knew it.
PATRICK=>But you didn't even make it! It was catered!
EVELYN=>Oh my god. I can't believe this.
PATRICK=>You go on inside, Evelyn.
EVELYN=>Patrick? What's going on?
PATRICK=>There's something I need to pick up.
EVELYN=>Oh for god's sake, just buy your drugs downstairs if you have to.
PATRICK=>Evelyn, honey, I'll be back before midnight.
EVELYN=>Patrick, you made me leave my own goddamned party.
PATRICK=>Don't have a hissy fit, Evelyn.
EVELYN=>You're impossible. There's something seriously wrong with you.
PATRICK=>Just go on inside and order me a Foster's, okay? I'll be back.
PATRICK=>Don't you bet on it.
PATRICK=>I haven't seen you around here.
WHORE=>You just haven't been looking.
PATRICK=>Do you take American Express?
PATRICK=>Just a joke, I'm only kidding... Would you like to see my apartment?
WHORE=>I'm not supposed to.
PATRICK=>What's the matter? Are you afraid of me? Do I look dangerous?
PATRICK=>Do you want to come up to my apartment or not?
WHORE=>I really shouldn't, but...
WHORE=>I can make an exception.
PATRICK=>Don't touch my fucking Rolex.
PATRICK=>We're not through yet...
PATRICK=>She leaves an hour later, bleeding but well paid.
PATRICK=>For a limited period of time I am actually capable of being halfway cheerful and outgoing.
PATRICK=>I'm a psychopathic murderer, oh yes I am...
PATRICK=>I like to kill people, oh yes I do, honey, little sweetie pie, yes I do...
WOMAN=>I think she likes you.
PATRICK=>What a beautiful baby... she looks just like you.
WOMAN=>She's not actually mine. I'm just watching her. Do I know you from somewhere?
PATRICK=>I don't know... do you?
WOMAN=>Are you a model? I could swear I've seen you in a magazine or somewhere.
WOMAN=>Ohmygod, I know who you are! You're that actor! You were in... um...
PATRICK=>No. Flattering, but no.
WOMAN=>Are you sure? So... what do you do?
PATRICK=>I'm into, oh, murders and executions mostly. It depends.
WOMAN=>Do you like it?
PATRICK=>Umm... yeah, sometimes. I guess so. Why do you ask?
WOMAN=>Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
PATRICK=>That's not what I said.
LUIS=>Patrick? Ohmygod, Patrick? Is that you?
PATRICK=>Luis Carruthers. Well, well.
PATRICK=>We were just--
LUIS=>What a cute baby!
PATRICK=>Oh my god.
PATRICK=>I think I need... to be... alone right now.
PATRICK=>Excuse me, I have to purchase a tie.
PATRICK=>Fuck, fuck, fuck...
LUIS=>What are you doing here?
LUIS=>Patrick, why won't you look at me? Look at me.
PATRICK=>Please, please leave me alone, Luis.
LUIS=>Come on, let's have a drink at Sofi's and talk about this.
PATRICK=>Talk about what?
LUIS=>Well... about us.
PATRICK=>Did you follow me in here?
LUIS=>Me? Follow you? Oh come on. Jesus.
PATRICK=>Luis. Please leave me alone. Go away.
LUIS=>Patrick. I love you very much. I hope you realize this. Patrick, what are we doing here?
PATRICK=>Well, I'm trying to buy a tie -- and you're trying to give me head, figure it out. Jesus, I'm getting out of here.
LUIS=>Patrick, we've got to talk.
PATRICK=>...I find myself cursing the earth and everything I have been taught: morals, choices, knowledge, prayer - all of it was wrong, without any final purpose, yet I am still able to find solace in many things: the new compact disc from Huey Lewis and the News, dress shirts from Ralph Lauren, the fact that I don't live in a trailer park or work in a bowling alley, the dinner reservations I have this evening with Paul Owen, the Patty Winters Show this morning was about shark attack victims...
PAUL=>You're late.
PATRICK=>Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.
PAUL=>This is really a beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam.
PATRICK=>Listen, I tried making a reservation at Dorsia, but--
PAUL=>I know, I know. Forget it. They've got a twelve-month waiting list. Twelve months, can you believe it? For Christ sake, Stallone can't even get in there!
PATRICK=>I didn't hear about this.
PAUL=>Yeah. Last week... they turned away Rambo himself.
PATRICK=>Just... say... no.
PAUL=>How've you been, Marcus?
PATRICK=>Great. Great... and you?
PAUL=>Terrific. Never better.
PATRICK=>Are you still handling the Fisher account?
PAUL=>Yeah. Lucked out, huh?
PATRICK=>How'd you get it?
PAUL=>Things just fell into place.
PATRICK=>Wow... So how were the Bahamas? You just got back, right?
PAUL=>Well, Marcus, let me tell you -- travelers looking for that perfect vacation this summer may do well to look south, as far south as the Bahamas and the Caribbean islands. There are at least five smart reasons to visit the Caribbean...
PAUL=>...those who can't take a full week away will find the Caribbean an ideal spot for the alternative weekend escape.
PATRICK=>This is enlightening.
PAUL=>For the active vacationer there is mountain climbing, cave exploring, sailing, horseback riding, white- water river rafting...
PAUL=>...for those who wish to gamble, there are casinos on many of the islands. As for dining out, the islands have attracted numerous world class chefs - American, British, French, Italian... even Dutch expatriates own many of the restaurants.
PATRICK=>My life is a living hell... and there are many more people I, uh, want to... want to, well, I guess, murder.
PAUL=>What you need is a vacation, Halberstam. You and that beautiful lady of yours, what's her name?
PATRICK=>Cecelia, Paul. My girlfriend's name is Cecelia.
PAUL=>That's right. You and Cecelia should really think about... getting away.
PATRICK=>Where would you suggest? The Bahamas, perhaps?
PAUL=>Why not? She'll love it. Do you golf, Marcus? The golf courses and tennis courts in the Bahamas are unlike anything you've ever seen. During the summer months, the pros at many of the resorts are made more available...
PATRICK=>Paul Owen is so drunk by the time dinner is over that I make him pay the check, which comes to over two hundred and fifty dollars, make him admit what a dumb son-of-a-bitch he really is...
PATRICK=>...and get him back to my place, where he makes himself another drink.
PAUL=>Hey, Halberstam.
PATRICK=>Yes, Owen.
PAUL=>Why are there, um, copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
PATRICK=>No, Owen.
PAUL=>Anyway, I used to hate Iggy Pop but now that he's so commercial I like him a lot better than-
PATRICK FUCKING STUPID BASTARD! FUCKING STUPID BASTARD!=>Things just fell into place, buddy.
PATRICK=>It takes Paul five minutes to finally die. Another thirty to stop bleeding.
PATRICK=>The aftermath: no fear, no confusion.
JEAN=>Patrick?
PATRICK=>What is it?
JEAN=>Patrick, a Mr. Donald Kimball is here to see you.
PATRICK=>Who?
JEAN=>Detective Donald Kimball.
PATRICK=>Tell him... Tell him I'm at lunch.
JEAN=>Patrick... I think he knows you're here. It's ten-thirty.
PATRICK=>Well... send him in.
WOMAN'S VOICE=>Are you a model?
WOMAN'S VOICE=>Ohmygod, I know who you are! You're that actor!
PATRICK=>Hi. Pat Bateman.
KIMBALL=>Donald Kimball.
KIMBALL=>I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and... well, anyway, you are, so...
KIMBALL=>I know how busy you guys can get. If it's any problem for you, I can--
PATRICK=>No. It's no problem at all.
PATRICK=>So... how can I help you?
KIMBALL=>I've been hired to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
PATRICK=>Ah, I see... yes. You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
KIMBALL=>No, no. Nothing like that. Just a private investigator.
PATRICK=>So... no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
KIMBALL=>No... no... I just have some, you know, basic questions. For my file.
PATRICK=>For your file.
KIMBALL=>About Paul Owen. About yourself-
PATRICK=>Coffee?
KIMBALL=>No, I'm okay.
PATRICK=>Perrier?
KIMBALL=>No, really. I'm fine.
JEAN=>Yes, Patrick?
PATRICK=>Jean, can you bring Mr. --
KIMBALL=>Kimball.
PATRICK=>Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
KIMBALL=>Oh no, really, that's not necessary.
PATRICK=>It's no problem at at all.
PATRICK=>So. Where were we then?
KIMBALL=>The disappearance of Paul Owen.
PATRICK=>Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about Paul Owen's disappearing act... At least not on Page Six.
KIMBALL=>I think his family wants this kept quiet.
PATRICK=>That's understandable.
PATRICK=>Lime?
KIMBALL=>No, really. I'm okay.
PATRICK=>You sure? Because I can always get you a lime.
KIMBALL=>I just have a few questions for you and then I'll be on my way--
KIMBALL=>Pardon me, but... are you okay?
PATRICK=>Why do you ask?
KIMBALL=>You seem... nervous.
PATRICK=>Nuprin?
KIMBALL=>Uh... no thanks.
PATRICK=>Bad habit.
KIMBALL=>I know. I'm sorry.
KIMBALL=>Do you... would you rather I not smoke?
PATRICK=>No... no... I guess it's okay.
KIMBALL=>You sure?
PATRICK=>Of course. It's no problem at all.
KIMBALL=>Where were you on the night of Paul Owen's disappearance?
PATRICK=>Unable to maintain a credible public persona, I find myself roaming the zoo in Central Park.
PATRICK=>Psst... hi.
PATRICK=>Would you like... a cookie?
MOTHER=>Are you playing hide-and-seek, honey?
PATRICK=>I'M A DOCTOR! MOVE BACK, I'M A DOCTOR!
MOTHER=>DO SOMETHING! DO SOMETHING!
POLICE OFFICER=>Okay, people -- let's go! Keep moving... keep moving.
PATRICK=>My appearances in the office the last month or so have been sporadic to say the least. I have all the characteristics of a human being -- flesh, blood, skin, hair -- yet I feel empty, hardly here at all. I am only imitating reality. These are terrible times.
JEAN=>Doin' the crossword puzzle?
JEAN=>Need help?
PATRICK=>Jean?
JEAN=>Yes, Patrick?
PATRICK=>Would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is, if you're not... doing anything.
JEAN=>Oh no. I have no plans.
PATRICK=>Well, isn't this a coincidence? Where should we go?
JEAN=>Anywhere you want?
PATRICK=>No, no, no. How about anywhere you want.
JEAN=>Oh Patrick. I can't make this decision.
PATRICK=>Come on. Anywhere you want. I can get us in anywhere.
JEAN=>How about...
PATRICK=>Don't say Dorsia, don't say Dorsia, don't say Dorsia...
JEAN=>...Dorsia?
PATRICK=>S-o-o-o... Jean wants to go to Dosia? Dorsia it is.
PATRICK=>Yes? You look... fine.
JEAN=>You didn't give them a name.
PATRICK=>They know me.
PATRICK=>Oh Jesus.
PATRICK=>Why don't you go to the women's room?
JEAN=>What?
PATRICK=>Don't you want to use the ladies' room?
JEAN=>Why? I mean... do I?
PATRICK=>Just... go.
JEAN=>But I don't need to go, Patrick.
PATRICK=>Oh Christ.
MAITRE D'=>Yes?
PATRICK=>Reservations at nine... for two.
MAITRE D'=>Yes? Name?
PATRICK=>Um, Schrawtz. Mr. and Mrs. Schrawtz.
MAITRE D'=>Follow me.
PATRICK=>Something bad is happening.
JEAN=>Why? What's wrong?
MAITRE D'=>Mr. and Mrs.... Schrawtz?
PATRICK=>I should have known better... I should have known better... I should have known better...
JEAN=>That was so funny. Your sense of humor is so spontaneous. Where to now, Mr. Schrawtz?
JEAN=>Well. Here we are.
PATRICK=>Here we are.
JEAN=>Dinner was wonderful. Thank you very much.
PATRICK=>Actually, the food was mediocre, but you're welcome.
JEAN=>Do you want to come up?
PATRICK=>Do you have any peyote?
JEAN=>What?
PATRICK=>Just a joke. I'd love to but I have to return some videotapes.
JEAN=>Now? It's almost midnight.
PATRICK=>Well, yeah...
JEAN=>Then, I guess... it's good night, Mr. Bateman.
PATRICK=>I am so used to imagining everything happening the way it occurs in movies, that I almost hear the swelling of the orchestra...
PATRICK=>...can almost hallucinate the camera panning low around us...
PATRICK=>...as fireworks burst overhead in slow motion...
PATRICK=>...the seventy-millimeter image of her lips parting, murmuring "I want you..."
PATRICK=>Listen, I've got to go. I don't want any... late fees.
JEAN=>Okay. Bye.
PATRICK=>Night.
JEAN=>Patrick! Don't forget you have a breakfast meeting... tomorrow...
EVELYN=>Patrick? Yoo-hoo, Patrick.
PATRICK=>I'm back.
EVELYN=>What's the matter, honey?
PATRICK=>Nothing. I've just got a lot on my mind. You know, work.
EVELYN=>What work? What work do you do? I don't understand.
PATRICK=>Evelyn... did you... take your medication?
EVELYN=>Why don't you just quit? You practically own that damn company.
PATRICK=>I wonder if Evelyn would sleep with another woman. Probably not; the odds don't look good. But what if I forced her at gunpoint?
PATRICK=>For dessert I've arranged something special.
WAITER=>Voi-ra!
EVELYN=>Patrick, that's so sweet.
EVELYN=>I adore Godiva.
EVELYN=>Aren't you having any?
PATRICK=>I'm not hungry. Dinner was... filling.
EVELYN=>Are you... sure?
PATRICK=>No, darling. I want you to eat it. There's not a lot there.
PATRICK=>Earlier today I stole a urinal cake from the men's room at the '21' Club, took it home, covered it with chocolate syrup and froze it.
PATRICK=>How is it? Go on... eat it.
EVELYN=>It's so...
PATRICK=>Yes? It's so... what?
EVELYN=>It's so... minty. It just... so minty.
PATRICK=>Though satisfying, watching Evelyn eat something that I and countless others have pissed on is a poor excuse to put up with her for three hours. Nothing is worth this... endless torture.
EVELYN=>I want a firm commitment.
PATRICK=>Oh my god.
PATRICK=>I think, Evelyn, that... that we've lost touch. We need to talk.
EVELYN=>Why? What's wrong, Patrick? If you're going to start in again on why I should have breast implants, I'm leaving.
PATRICK=>Just... just hear me out, Evelyn. My need to engage in... homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected. But I -- I have no other way to express my blocked needs. It's over, Evelyn. It's all over.
EVELYN=>Touchy, touchy.
PATRICK=>I'm serious. It is fucking over. Us. This is no joke.
EVELYN=>Let's just avoid this subject, all right? I'm sorry I said anything.
PATRICK=>I'm not going to push the issue, but--
EVELYN=>How uncharacteristic of you, Patrick.
PATRICK=>Why must you constantly undermine my stability? Evelyn. This has got to end. I don't think we should see each other any more.
EVELYN=>But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. You have a tiny fleck on the top of your lip. Use your napkin.
PATRICK=>Listen, I know that your friends are my friends and vice versa. I've thought about that. You can have them.
EVELYN=>You're really serious aren't you?
PATRICK=>Yes I am.
EVELYN=>Do you have something against me, Patrick?
PATRICK=>Evelyn. I'm sorry. You're just... not terribly important... to me.
EVELYN=>Well, who is? Who do you think is, Patrick? Who do you want? Cher?
PATRICK=>Cher? Cher? What are you talking about? Forget it. I know my behavior is erratic sometimes-
EVELYN=>Oh god, Patrick. You're so lousy. You're inhuman.
PATRICK=>No, I'm... in touch with humanity. I'm...
EVELYN=>You... are not...
PATRICK=>I'm not what?
EVELYN=>You are not all there. You don't add up.
PATRICK=>I do too. I do too add up. Listen, Evelyn. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
EVELYN=>Don't. Please don't go.
PATRICK=>I'm leaving Evelyn.
EVELYN=>Where are you going? Tell me, Patrick, where are you going?
PATRICK=>I'm just leaving.
EVELYN=>But where?
PATRICK=>Jesus Christ, does it matter, Evelyn? I'm going to Libya, ALRIGHT? LIBYA!
PATRICK=>Because of your outburst I'm not paying for this meal.
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE=>Halt! Stop! Put down your weapon! Don't move! Drop your weapon!
PATRICK=>LET'S GO! GET OUT OF HERE! FAST!
CAB DRIVER=>Don't shoot me, please don't kill me!
PATRICK=>Oh shit! JUST FUCKING DRIVE!
CAB DRIVER=>Oh don't shoot me man don't shoot--
PATRICK=>Fuck yourself!
PATRICK=>Patrick tries to put the cab into reverse, but...
PATRICK=>...nothing happens.
PATRICK=>Nice going, Bateman.
PATRICK=>Patrick has no idea where the cop across the street has come from. Patrick is stunned, but...
PATRICK=>...still manages to surprise him, lunging out before the cop can get to his gun.
PATRICK=>Patrick feels infected, like gasoline is coursing through his veins instead of blood.
PATRICK=>Patrick realizes that he is involved in an actual gunfight...
PATRICK=>...I have no idea what I've done to increase my chances of getting caught. I shot a saxophonist? A saxophonist? Who was probably a mime too? For that I get this?
PATRICK=>There's no use in denying it: this has been a bad week.
JEAN=>Come on, Patrick. Smile. You have no reason to be so sad.
PATRICK=>I know. You're right, but... It's... tough to smile -- these days. At least for me it is.
PATRICK=>You know what I think? I think that we're all in our private traps. Clamped in them tight. And none of us can ever get out. We scratch and claw, but only at the air. Only at each other. And for all of it we never budge an inch.
JEAN=>Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
PATRICK=>I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
JEAN=>Awww, poor baby.
JEAN=>Listen, Patrick. We need to talk about something. Or at least I need to talk about something.
JEAN=>I've learned what it's like to be alone and... I think I'm in love with you.
PATRICK=>Shhhh... I was at a restaurant the other night... and I saw some guy in the men's room... a total Wall Street guy.
PATRICK=>I saw...
PATRICK=>...he was writing...
PATRICK=>...something on the wall over the... urinal he was standing at.
PATRICK=>When he saw me come in...
PATRICK=>He stopped writing -- like he was nervous or something... then he left the room.
PATRICK=>Anyway... I went over to use the urinal and... I leaned over... to read what he wrote.
JEAN=>Which was?
PATRICK=>Kill... all... yuppies.
JEAN=>Gosh, Patrick...
PATRICK=>How many people in this world do you think are like me, Jean?
JEAN=>I don't... think anyone.
PATRICK=>Let me rephrase the ques -- wait, how does my hair look?
JEAN=>Uh, fine.
PATRICK=>Okay. I think... uh, you know how they say no two snowflakes are alike?
PATRICK=>Well, I think a lot of snowflakes are alike... and I think that a lot of people are alike, too.
JEAN=>What are you saying, Patrick?
PATRICK=>Appearances can be deceiving.
JEAN=>No. I disagree. I don't think they are deceiving.
PATRICK=>Sometimes, Jean, the lines separating appearance -- what you see -- and reality -- what you don't -- become, well, blurred.
JEAN=>That's not true. That's simply not true.
PATRICK=>Really?
JEAN=>Patrick... talk to me... don't be so upset.
PATRICK=>I think it's... time for me to... take a good look... at the world I've created.
DR. NOVA=>Let's pick up where we left off last week, shall we Patrick?
RONALD REAGAN=>My fellow Americans, thank you for sharing your time with me tonight.
RONALD REAGAN=>...I want to offer hope for the future.
TED BUNDY=>...I grew up in a wonderful home with two dedicated and loving Christian parents...
RONALD REAGAN=>From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society has become too complex...
TED BUNDY=>...I don't want to infer that I was some helpless victim...
TED BUNDY=>...I'm not blaming pornography for what I've done...
RONALD REAGAN=>Of all the changes in the past twenty years, none has more threatened our sense of national well-being than the explosion of violent crime.
GORDON GEKKO=>...greed is good.
GORDON GEKKO=>Greed works, greed is right.
RONALD REAGAN=>There can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among us are allowed to roam free.
TED BUNDY=>People need to realize that those of us who have been so influenced by violence in the media--
TED BUNDY=>-- in particular pornographic violence --
RONALD REAGAN=>Drugs are menacing our society. They're threatening our values and undercutting our institutions.
TED BUNDY=>-- are not inherent monsters. We are your sons and we are your husbands. And we grew up in regular families.
RONALD REAGAN=>For a time we forgot the American dream...
RONALD REAGAN=>I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen.
RONALD REAGAN=>Today there's a new epidemic: smokable cocaine, otherwise known as crack.
GORDON GEKKO=>Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures --
GORDON GEKKO=>-- the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
NANCY REAGAN=>...so much has happened over these last years, so much to shake the foundations of all that we know and all that we believe in.
TED BUNDY=>...we're talking about an influence which was an indispensable link in the chain of behavior--
TED BUNDY=>-- the chain of events that led to the assaults, murders...
TED BUNDY=>Alcohol... with the use of pornography reduced my inhibitions...
NANCY REAGAN=>Say yes to your life. And when it comes to drugs and alcohol just say no.
RONALD REAGAN=>Think for a moment how special it is to be an American.
RONALD REAGAN=>To some extent, we are also victims of our own success.
RONALD REAGAN=>This is reality. Closing your eyes will not make reality disappear.
RONALD REAGAN=>How well prepared are we to enter the Twenty-First Century?
RONALD REAGAN=>Are we at the end?
RONALD REAGAN=>Where's the beef?
TED BUNDY=>What I hope will come of our discussion is that society deserves to be protected from itself...
DR. NOVA=>I'm sorry, Patrick. Our time is up.
LUIS=>Patrick? Is that you?
PATRICK=>Oh... my... god.
LUIS=>Patrick? Hello?
PATRICK=>Don't make me say it, Luis.
LUIS=>Patrick? What do you mean?
PATRICK=>I'm ignoring you, Luis. Can't you tell? I'm ignoring you.
LUIS=>Patrick, can't we just talk?
LUIS=>Patrick -- look at me!
PATRICK=>There is nothing, nothing to talk--
LUIS=>We can't go on like this. I can't go on like this.
PATRICK=>You are sick.
LUIS=>If I'm sick it's because of you. Because of you I am sick and I will not get better.
PATRICK=>You have distorted this obsession of yours way out of proportion. Way, way out of proportion.
LUIS=>But I know you have the same feelings I do. And I know that just because... Just because you won't admit... certain feelings doesn't mean you don't have them.
PATRICK=>What are you trying to say?
LUIS=>That I know you feel the same way I do. Is it so wrong to love you, Patrick?
PATRICK=>Jesus Christ, Luis. Get a hold of yourself.
LUIS=>To want you? To want to be with you? Is that so wrong?
PATRICK=>What is this continuing inability you have to evaluate this situation rationally? Huh? Go away.
LUIS=>Oh god, Patrick, why don't you like me?
PATRICK=>Get up. Get up.
LUIS=>Why can't we be together?
PATRICK=>Because I... don't-- -- find you... sexually attractive.
PATRICK=>I can't believe I actually said that. Leave me alone. Please.
LUIS=>Please, Patrick, please don't leave me.
PATRICK=>Listen to me, Luis. If you do not stop crying, you fucking pathetic faggot, I am going to slit your fucking throat. Are you listening to me? I mean it, Luis.
LUIS=>Oh just kill me. If I can't have you, I don't want to live. I want to die.
PATRICK=>Listen to me. ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME? I don't usually warn people, so- be-thankful-I-am-warning-you.
PATRICK=>You want to die, Luis? I'll do it, I swear to god, Luis, I'll fucking kill you. I'll rip your fucking stomach open and cram your intestines down your fucking faggot throat until you choke on them.
LUIS=>Please, Patrick, please. Listen to me--
PATRICK=>Shut up, Luis. My god, just shut the fuck up.
LUIS=>I love you.
PATRICK=>I'm convinced Luis. You've convinced me. Now get up.
PATRICK=>Just, you know, have the guts to face, uh, reality.
JEAN=>Patrick? Tim Price would like to see you.
PATRICK=>Send him... in.
PATRICK=>Price. Where have you been?
TIM=>Oh, just making the rounds. But hey, I'm back.
PATRICK=>Far out. How was... it?
TIM=>It was... surprising. It was... depressing. Hey, how are you, Bateman?
PATRICK=>I'm okay. Just... existing.
TIM=>And Evelyn? How is she?
PATRICK=>Well, we broke up.
TIM=>That's too bad. Courtney?
PATRICK=>She married Luis.
PATRICK=>You've been gone, like, forever, Tim. What's the story?
TIM=>I've been back. You probably just missed me. Lost track, you know?
PATRICK=>Would you like a jellybean?
TIM=>You're a madman, Bateman. An animal.
TIM=>A total animal.
PATRICK=>I can't disagree.
PATRICK=>Yes? What?
TAXI DRIVER=>Hey, don't I know you?
PATRICK=>No.
TAXI DRIVER=>You look familiar.
PATRICK=>No I don't. You don't either. Chris Hagen.
TAXI DRIVER=>Come on. I know who you are.
PATRICK=>I'm in a movie. I'm an actor. A model.
TAXI DRIVER=>Nah, that's not it. I've seen your face somewhere.
PATRICK=>You have? Really? Interesting. Just watch the road, Abdullah.
TAXI DRIVER=>I know. Man, I know who you are.
TAXI DRIVER=>You're the guy who kill Solly.
PATRICK=>Who, may I ask, is Sally?
TAXI DRIVER=>Man, your face is on a wanted poster downtown.
PATRICK=>I think I would like to stop here.
TAXI DRIVER=>You're the guy, right?
PATRICK=>I am going to take your license number down--
TAXI DRIVER=>You kill Solly. You son-of-a-bitch!
TAXI DRIVER=>The watch.
PATRICK=>Is this some kind of prank?
TAXI DRIVER=>Get out.
TAXI DRIVER=>Get the fuck out of the car.
TAXI DRIVER=>The watch, you scumbag.
PATRICK=>Listen, I don't know what it is you think you're going to accomplish or what it is you think you're going to be able to do. I've never been fingerprinted, I have alibis--
TAXI DRIVER=>Shut up! Just shut your fucking mouth!
PATRICK=>I am innocent.
TAXI DRIVER=>The watch.
TAXI DRIVER=>Wallet. Just the cash.
PATRICK=>What are you going to do? Isn't there a reward of some kind?
TAXI DRIVER=>No. No reward.
PATRICK=>How do you know I'm not going to call you in and get your license revoked?
TAXI DRIVER=>Because you're guilty.
PATRICK=>Like you know.
TAXI DRIVER=>The sunglasses. Get the knife away from me.
PATRICK=>How do you know I'm guilty?
TAXI DRIVER=>Look what you're doing, asshole. The sunglasses.
PATRICK=>These are expensive.
PATRICK=>I mean cheap. They're very cheap. Just... isn't the money enough?
TAXI DRIVER=>The sunglasses. Give them now.
PATRICK=>You're a dead man.
TAXI DRIVER=>And you're a yuppie scumbag.
PATRICK=>You're a dead man. Count on it.
TAXI DRIVER=>Yeah? And you're a yuppie scumbag. Which is worse?
PATRICK=>I just want to... keep the game going, I just want... to keep... the game... going... I just want...
PATRICK=>Oh, will you please go away?
HOMELESS WOMAN=>Get a decent haircut.
RONALD REAGAN=>It's been the honor of my life to be your president. So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could say as much to you. Nancy and I are grateful for...
RONALD REAGAN=>It's been quite a journey this decade, and we held together through some stormy seas. And at the end, together, we are reaching our destination.
RONALD REAGAN=>America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership...
RONALD REAGAN=>Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce less of it. So, we cut people's tax rates, and the people produced more than ever before. The economy bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger...
TIM=>How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
PATRICK=>Oh Christ. What shit? What the hell are you talking about?
TIM=>I don't believe it. He looks so... normal. He seems so... out of it. So... undangerous.
CRAIG=>He is totally harmless, you asshole. Just like you are totally harmless. Look at Bateman over there... I'll bet he's totally harmless, aren't you buddy?
PATRICK=>I have no recollection of any wrong doing whatsoever.
TIM=>I just don't get how someone, anyone, can appear that way yet be involved in such total shit.
RONALD REAGAN=>The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we're a great nation, our challenges seem complex.
DAVID=>How about because Nancy was right behind him? Because Nancy did it all?
TIM=>How can you be so fucking, I don't know -- cool about it?
DAVID=>Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
TIM=>And Bateman -- what are you so fucking zany about?
PATRICK=>I'm just a happy camper. Don't worry, Price. Be happy.
CRAIG=>Be all that you can be.
TIM=>Oh brother. Look... He presents himself as a harmless old codger. But inside... But inside...
CRAIG=>Inside? Yes, inside? Go on, Tim.
TIM=>Bateman - help me out, here. What do you think about this?
PATRICK=>Inside... doesn't matter.
RONALD REAGAN=>...a final word to the men and women of the Reagan revolution, the men and women across America who for eight years did the work that brought America back. My friends: We did it.
RONALD REAGAN=>We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.
PATRICK=>I've been a big fan of Genesis ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Although I found all of their previous albums to be too artsy, too intellectual, I was able to embrace Duke, mainly because the music became more modern, the drum machine became more prevalent and the lyrics started getting less mystical, more specific. Complex, ambiguous studies of loss became, instead, first-rate pop songs. A classic example of this is "Misunderstanding", which not only was the group's first big hit of the Eighties, but also seemed to set the tone for the rest of the decade. Duke was followed almost immediately by ABACAB, yet another weapon in an increasingly impressive musical arsenal. Once again the songs reflect dark emotions, focusing on people who feel lost or are in conflict. Sound depressing? Hardly. The production and sound, courtesy of producer Hugh Padgham, are gleaming and upbeat. One of my favorite songs, "Who Dunnit?" profoundly expresses the theme of confusion over a funky groove and what makes this song so exciting is that it ends with its narrator never finding anything out at all--
