VITTORIA=>How shalt rid him hence?
BRACCIANO=>Most wishedly.
VITTORIA=>The duchess -
CORNELIA=>O, my heart!
ISABELLA=>Not yet, sir.
FRANCISCO=>I wish I may.
FRANCISCO=>Do not fear it.

MONTICELCO=>At your pleasure, sir.
BRACCIANO=>That question
MONTICELSO=>Your business?
FLAMINEO=>Who, I?
VITTORIA=>A rape! a rape!
FLAMINEO=>Not a scruple. The Pope lies on his death-bed, and their heads Are troubled now with other business Than guarding of a lady.
ZANCHE=>I know not.
FLAMINEO=>Ud's foot!
BRACCIANO=>In, you pander!
BRACCIANO=>Do you know me?

FLAMINEO=>No, my lord.
FLAMINEO=>I do not like that he names me so often, Especially on his death-bed; 'tis a sign I shall not live long. See, he's near his end.
GASPARO=>Perpetually.
LODOVICO=>The snuff is out.
FLAMINEO=>Very likely: Those are found weighty strokes which come from the hand, But those are killing strokes which come from the head. O, the rare tricks of a Machivillian!
ZANCHE=>Most true.
FRANCISCO=>It shall; away.
FLAMINEO=>I’ll see ‘em.
VITTORIA=>How, ruffian?
ZANCHE=>Yes, madam.
ZANCHE=>Help, help!
ZANCHE=>Gentle madam, Seem to consent, only persuade him to teach The way to death; let him die first.
FLAMINEO=>I have held it A wretched and most miserable life, Which is not able to die.
ZANCHE=>I have blood As red as either of theirs: wilt drink some? 'Tis good for the falling-sickness. I am proud: Death cannot alter my complexion, For I shall never look pale.
