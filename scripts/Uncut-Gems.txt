HOWARD=>Alright! Alright.
HOWARD=>Carmelle. Please-
CARMELLE, I’M SORRY!=>We’ll change the title asap.
INSURANCE CLAIM, COLLECT WHAT=>YOU’RE OWED. I’M GONNA PUT THIS MONEY INTO AN ACCOUNT FOR THEM TODAY, IN A FEW HOURS, ONCE THAT’S
DONE...=>THEY’LL LET US KNOW WHERE YOUR STUFF IS BEING STORED AND NEITHER OF YOU WILL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A THING. JOANI WILL HAVE MOVERS BRING YOUR STUFF BACK HERE AND I’LL PERSONALLY COME BACK AND REARRANGE IT TO THE WAY IT WAS. PLUS I GOT A STONE COMING THROUGH THIS WEEK, IT’LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYONE, TRUST ME. I CAN HIT YOU OFF WITH SOME MORE CASH-DID THEY GET TO YOUR SAFE?
HOWARD=>Hit all of them.
WAITRESS=>We can’t do a bottle, but I can keep them coming.
HOWARD=>Next week likely.
HOWARD=>I can have something similar for you by next week.
HOWARD=>They’re not fake!
HOWARD=>They’re not fake!
HOWARD=>Go, go go! C’mon!
HOWARD=>Not interested.
SADIE=>Look, get something like this, do a Channel setting with two smaller stones next to it. That’s classy.
HOWARD=>What is this!?! Sadie, put this back in the safe.
SADIE=>I’m sorry, hon.
SADIE=>What about me?
YUSSI=>I can get them for you in yellow or Rose for cheap.
PRIVELEJ=>Oh yeah, how much?
HOWARD=>Tomorrow? Sure. Wait, fuck, I have my kid’s play...
HOWARD=>Oh... my... god, AMARE. You’re gonna LOVE this.
ANTHONY=>What do you want? HOWARD
HOWARD=>You know what, I’ll get a bite, what’s good here? Can I see a menu?
NAGY!=>HOWARD walks in.
HOWARD=>Frank, anything?
SADIE=>I’m in the tub!
HOWARD=>Why’re there smudge marks all over the mirror near the bed?
HOWARD=>Well it hasn’t...
SADIE=>Of course I did.
10:27AM.=>The call goes to voicemail: an excerpt of Biggie’s ‘Gimme One More Chance.’
HOWARD=>Utter horseshit! DEMANY
HOWARD=>No, I’m with him. DEMANY
HOWARD=>You see that shit? You saw us arrive together.
ANTHONY=>Howard, sit down.
ROBERT=>Ahhhh! My fucking hand.
HOWARD=>Can I speak now?
HOWARD=>Jim, with all due respect, I’d just like to explain. Please, just let me explain. I told you that a gem was arriving this week. Well, it did. It’s sitting on my desk in my office right now. It completely drained me of cash, but I have it. Precious opals of this size go for 1, 2 grand a carat. It’s 600 carats! It’s worth anywhere between 600 and a mil and it’s up for auction next week. Why you’re chasing me through my kid’s school on a Thursday when you can have your money in full on a Tuesday is crazy to me. Crazy.
YEAH, SHE’S HERE.=>HOWARD
HOWARD=>NO WORRIES. I NEED TO KNOW IF MY GIRL IS IN THERE.
HOWARD=>They’re on loan.
AMARE=>What’s going on? HOWARD
AMARE=>WHAT DO WE DO?!
FUCK!=>OKAY, HANG TIGHT! 30% OFF ANYTHING YOU GUYS WANT IN HERE! I SWEAR.
NADAV=>It’s impossible.
SADIE=>Please, Howard! It was a mistake, I was fucked up, I’m sorry!
HOWARD=>Incredible, huh?
HOWARD=>It’s black as night. And the thing is skin to skin.
AREN=>You kidding me? I’d lose my GIA certification. We can say the 175 to 250 range. Start bidding at 100.
DINA=>7 months ago.
RAQUEL=>That’s too long.
SPORTSCASTER=>AMARE Stoudemire, 3 for 17...
SPORTCASTER=>It’s like the boiler broke.
GOOEY=>What did he say? HOWARD
GOOEY=>What’s it value? HOWARD
GOOEY=>Absolutely not.
HOWARD=>Look at the guy.
EDDIE.=>DINA surveys Instagram in the front seat. HOWARD sees that it’s 10:15 on the car’s clock.
AUCTIONEER=>As you can see the rough opal has been windowed on either side. Before even being cut you can see a dazzling array of color in the classic pin-fire pattern that, with the right cutter, could yield up to 50 or 60%. There seem to be a few recorded totches on the backside and cutting needs to be precise if that is the intention of the buyer. Let’s open this at $40,000.
AUCTIONEER=>Do we have 110? Anyone, 110?
AUCTIONEER=>200 to counter Mr. Dabba? 200? PERSONAL ASSISTANT is clearly reluctant. AUCTIONEER
AUCTIONEER=>Sold to Mr. Dabba for 190,000 dollars. Thank you Mr. Dabba.
JIM=>Is this a joke?
JIM=>Put it on speaker. I want to hear him say 175.
AMARE=>Very refreshing.
SADIE=>Where you going? NADAV
AMARE=>You know I will. AMARE exits the backroom.
NADAV=>The fastest way.
ROBERT=>What’s going on? HOWARD
THEY’RE PLAYING THE FUCKING=>HORNETS, THE HORNETS ARE 5 AND 10 ON THE ROAD! THE LINE DOESN’T MAKE SENSE! DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF GAME AMARE HAD WITH THE GEM? A 40/20 GAME! HE’S UNDERVALUED BECAUSE OF SHITTY PLAY WITHOUT THE GEM. YOU JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND!
OPEN THE DOOR!!!=>HOWARD
GONNA DO ANYTHING?=>Sadie, baby everything is fine. It’s bulletproof- Why don’t you guys go wait in the back room?
HOWARD=>Exactly, focused.
BUZZZZ!=>ROBERT opens the door into the space and IMMEDIATELY SHOOTS HOWARD IN THE FACE. HOWARD drops to the floor.
SHUT UP...=>YOU, TAKE HIM TO WHERE THE SECURITY CAMERAS RECORD TO.
PLEASE DON’T HURT ME.=>NICO
JIM=>GET UP AND PACK THE SHOWCASE!
SADIE=>FUCK YOU, YOU FAT PIG!
