SUSAN=>It went well by the way. Apparently.
CONTINUOUS.=>We enter the house. It is beautiful and expensive. The art on the walls is staggering and the mix of contemporary art with 18th century furniture and the modern architecture of the house itself is eccentric in the extreme. A butler leads us into a room filled with a small group of people. All know each other well. Susan and Hutton are greeted with cheek kisses.
CONTINUOUS.=>We are on the front steps of the house. There is a black Mercedes and driver waiting for Hutton.
LAURA=>Leave us alone.
RAY=>Jesus Christ.
TONY=>Shhh. Be quiet. INDIA
INDIA=>Leave him alone!
CONTINUOUS.=>Horrified, Susan snaps the book closed. She is stunned. The deafening silence and the stillness of her bedroom is in sharp contrast to the scene she just read. It takes her a moment to calm down. She picks up her phone and dials.
TONY=>I’m ready now.
ANDES=>How do you know?
TONY=>Not very well.
CONTINUOUS.=>Susan gasps as she continues to fondle the gold cross around her neck. She closes the book. Her breathing is rapid and she slowly collects herself. Susan picks up the phone on her night table and dials.
SUSAN=>Edward? Edward!
SUSAN=>Do you know anyone here?
EVENING.=>Susan and Edward are finished with dinner and are having drinks. It is clear that they have already had a few as the atmosphere between them is warm and intimate.
RAY=>What is this?
ANDES=>What then Tony?
ANDES=>Care to look inside Ray?
TONY=>I’ll leave now.
TONY=>You okay Bobby? ANDES
ANDES=>Shoot him Tony!
TONY=>They’re around.
RAY=>Are they here?
SUSAN=>Edward.
SUSAN=>Yes, thank you.
