LONG SHOT A GONDOLA=>Two tourists. Husband and wife. They are in a sentimental embrace. In back is the gondolier. Camera follows gondola a few seconds, coming closer.
ANOTHER GONDOLA=>Camera shoots down. Gondola is covered by a typical little canopy, so that gondolier cannot see the passengers. Camera cuts canopy on one side so that we don't see, at first, who is paddling. In the gondola seat is a woman in evening gown, lots of jewels. She lies in the arms of the gondolier. They kiss. Camera moves up and discovers who is paddling the boat. It is the husband of the lady who is having such a good time with the gondolier. Husband is in tuxedo and straw hat, smoking a long cigar. He is enjoying it like a child with a new toy.

In the background, sitting on the arm of a chair which is by the open window, is an elegantly dressed man. Evening clothes, overcoat, hat, walking stick. Annoyed by the crying and by the outside music, he gets up and slams the window shut with a bang.
HOTEL CORRIDOR CLOSE SHOT=>at room door. We see the numbers 253, 5, 7, 9. At the door are two Italian dames, obviously disreputable. One is pushing the buzzer. They speak in Italian, but their emphasis and pantomime make the following clear to English- speaking audiences: Girl No. 1 brought Girl No. 2 to see the gentleman of room 253. Girl No. 1 rings again. Girl No. 2 complains to Girl No. 1 that she should have known better than to have brought her here and wasted her time. Girl No. 1 apologizes and indicates her watch as if to say, "The appointment was definite. I can't understand it." She rings again--viciously this time.

CLOSE SHOT=>at door in office building, shooting from corridor into a nondescript little waiting room. Door is open so that we can't see sign on it. In doorway stands a fat little Turk with a pointed black beard. He bows repeatedly to someone behind camera.

GOLF COURSE CLOSE-UP=>of the major, a man about forty-five, in smart golf togs. He looks dejected.
CLOSE-UP MARIETTE=>on golf course, also in smart sport clothes. She is getting set to swing at the ball and is more concerned with her golf form than with what she is saying.
STAIRCASE IN MARIETTE'S HOME=>Maid comes down, leans over railing, addresses someone behind camera.
SOFA IN FRONT HALL=>François and Major, seated. Both in full evening dress-- overcoats on, top hats on knees, opera sticks in hands. Expressions serious as they nod to maid, then lean back without looking at each other.
OPERA HOUSE CLOSE SHOT=>Part of the orchestra; shooting on an angle down, so that we photograph part of the orchestra and a portion of the footlights without the singers. We hear the orchestral music and the singers' voices.
OPERA BOX=>Door opens. Mariette and Major come in. Mariette looks annoyed. She sits. Major sits.

MARIETTE'S BOX=>Gaston's viewpoint, photographed through an opera-glass vignette. We see Major and Mariette. Camera stops in front of the railing. We see Mariette's hand holding the handbag. Camera centers the handbag. We hold this, then camera pans up to Mariette's face. She is looking at the stage. Camera pans quickly down again to handbag. We stay on the handbag. Major's hand comes in and touches Mariette's hand caressingly. She brushes his hand aside. Camera moves quickly up to Major. He is looking ardently at Mariette. He leans over to her. Camera with him. Both in the picture. A dialogue scene now follows, but even though it is a close-up, we can't hear them because they are through binoculars from a distance. In this inaudible but visually expressive scene, Major tells her he can't understand her attitude toward him. She impatiently asks him to leave her alone to enjoy the opera opera. Major persistently says he loves her. Mariette insists that he stop it. She takes out of her lap opera glasses and holds them to her eyes. Major gives up, leans back in chair. Camera centers Mariette, alone. Then camera, still framed in opera-glass vignette, pans down and comes to rest on handbag, now lying on the railing unprotected.
CLOSE-UP CONDUCTOR=>from viewpoint of the stage. He is looking up at the singers. Then he looks down to his score.

CORRIDOR=>outside Mariette's box. Door opens. Mariette and Major come out, shut door. Major is carrying hat and coat. They are still searching, looking everywhere. Camera moves with them as they go down the corridor. Mariette goes into ladies' room. Major automatically follows her; door closes behind them. An instant later, Major scurries out. Followed by camera, he hurries away, embarrassed, stops, turns.
CLOSE SHOT=>at door to ladies' restroom. The maid, a middle-aged woman, looks grimly at Major.
CLOSE-UP MAJOR=>He doesn't know what to say or how to act. At this moment the music stops. We hear the bursting final applause.

CAMERA MOVES=>back along window with them. As soon as the two young ladies are out of the picture, Mariette brings Gaston intimately close toward window and camera. Charmingly and with a twinkle in her eye, she reprimands him, in a guarded whisper, about flirting. He answers and apparently says something that makes her laugh, disarming her. With a sudden return to party manner, she moves with him along the framed windows. Camera goes with them as she introduces him to a few little groups. By this time, they are back in the first window frame, and now they move out of picture.

TERRACE CLOSE SHOT=>at window shooting into living room. Giron comes toward window and looks into garden. His face gets stern and angry as he sees:
