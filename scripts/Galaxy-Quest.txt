LAREDO=>We're exiting the time knot now sir!
FRED=>We're alive.
LAREDO=>We made it Commander, we made it!
LAZARUS=>By Grabthar's hammer, we live to tell the tale.
COMPUTER=>Systems register functional.
GWEN=>All systems are working, Commander. Commander?
COMMANDER=>I don't like it. It was too easy... Look for ambient energy fields.
LAREDO=>All normal sir... The entire spectrum.
COMMANDER=>Check again Laredo.
LAREDO=>Yes sir, I- Wait. Oh no.
LAREDO=>They're everywhere. There are time knots opening everywhere.
LAZARUS=>IMPACT NOW Commander
GWEN=>A trap.
LAZARUS.=>We're surrounded Commander. The entire 5k Ranking is out there.
COMMANDER=>Our plasma armor?
LAREDO=>Gone sir.
COMPUTER=>Structural damage at 68 percent.
GWEN=>We're getting major structural damage.
FRED=>It's a core meltdown sir. It can't be stopped
LAZARUS=>Commander, surrender may be our only option.
COMMANDER=>No, never give up... NEVER surrender.'
GWEN=>The reactor has eaten through four levels... Six levels... The ship is disintegrating
LAREDO=>Your orders sir?... Sir, your orders?
COMMANDER=>Activate the Omega 13.
GUY=>Well, there you are! You are the first people to see the lost GALAXY QUEST episode 52 two parter since it was originally aired in '82! As most of you know, no concluding episode was filmed when the series was cancelled, so one episode was never included in the syndication run. Let's hear it for Travis Latke, who actually rescued the footage from the studio garbage! Can you believe that? Now for the moment you've all been waiting for... The intrepid crew of the NSEA PROTECTOR!
GUY=>But first... What is a "hero"? Let's take a look at a few more clips...
TOMMY=>Where the hell is he? An hour and a half late. An hour and a half!
GWEN=>This is great! They're going to start eating each other out there.
ALEXANDER=>He's a twit!
TOMMY=>Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
GWEN=>You're kidding. When for?
TOMMY=>Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
ALEXANDER=>He's a miserable twit!
GWEN=>The guy is terminally selfish!
FRED=>He ate my sandwich.
GWEN AND TOMMY=>What?
FRED=>A month ago, he ate my sandwich.
TOMMY=>And he ate Fred's SANDWICH!
GWEN=>Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
ALEXANDER=>Dear God.... How did I come to this?
TOMMY=>Not again...
ALEXANDER=>I played Richard III...
FRED=>"Five curtain calls...
ALEXANDER=>...Five curtain calls! I was an ACTOR once, damn it. Now look at me... LOOK AT ME.
TOMMY=>Settle down, Alex...
ALEXANDER=>No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't. I can't!
GWEN=>At least you had a PART. You had a character people loved! My TV Guide interview was six paragraphs about this body suit. About my legs. How did I perfect my trademark sidesaddle pose? Nobody ever bothered to ask what I DO on the ship...
FRED=>You were the, uh... Wait I'll think of it...
GWEN=>I repeated the computer. "It's getting hotter, Commander!" "The ship is disintegrating, Commander!" Nothing I did EVER affected the plot, not ONCE! Nothing I did was ever taken seriously!
TOMMY=>Excuse me. I'm an African American playing a nine year old Malaysian named Laredo. HELLO!
JASON=>My friends, your Commander has arrived!... Am I too late for Alexander's panic attack?... Apparently so. That's irregular, you should have it looked at. Lakers are HOT. Speaking of which... Gwen, you look spectacular. Oh, what did I do now?
GUY=>... Sure, the rocks looked hollow and the sets moved when anyone humped into them... But we didn't care...
GUY=>....For those four seasons from '79 to '82 we the viewers developed the same affection for the crew of the NSEA PROTECTOR that the crew had for each other... These weren't just adventurers exploring space, these were friends...
TOMMY=>You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
JASON=>I didn't say that. I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
GWEN=>Unbelievable.
TOMMY=>You are so full of shit
JASON=>A few fans built a little set in their garage. . I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
GWEN=>How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
JASON=>What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
GUY=>Okay, here we go... Let's hear a warm welcome for crack gunner/navigator. Laredo, Tommy Webber!
GUY=>Ship's Tech Sergeant Chen... Fred Kwan!
FRED AS CHEN=>"Give me a stick of gum and a hairpin and we re on our way!"
GWEN=>Alex you can't -just leave.
ALEXANDER=>Oh can't I? Watch me!
JASON=>Come on, old friend...
ALEXANDER=>Friend. You stole all my best lines. You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
COMPUTER=>One hundred degrees and rising...
GWEN AS TAWNY ~~~ISON=>"It's... It's getting hotter, Commander.'"
GUY=>And now... The Commander's advisor and closest friend. His peaceful nature ever at odds with the savage warrior inside him, after witnessing the massacre of his entire species as a boy...
JASON=>You WILL go out there.
ALEXANDER=>I won't and nothing you say-
JASON=>"The show must go on."
ALEXANDER=>...Damn you! Damn you!
ALEX AS LAZARUS ONSCREEN=>"By Grabthar's hammer, you shall be avenged.'"
GUY=>And finally, my fellow Questarians, the brave Commander of the NSEA PROTECTOR... Peter Quincy Taggart ... JASON NESMITH.
TOMMY=>Unbelievable. He rented a SPOT?
JASON/JASON ON SCREEN/EVERYONE=>"NEVER GIVE UP, NEVER SURRENDER... DAMN THE RESONANCE CANNONS, FULL SPEED AHEAD.'"
GUY=>The Commander and his crew will be signing autographs on imperial decks "b" and "c" near the coke machines.
ALIEN=>...Yeah, I used to De Gark'nor of Ang but I got a rash from the chest pads so now I'm Sacnod from episode 5, which is fine except the transducer pinches when I sit down...
BRANDON=>The tail fin is concave, not convex. The proton reactor is where the influx thermistors should be and.. my god... is this Testor's blue green number six on the hull? I... I... This is a complete abortion.
TOMMY=>Is it me or does his table get higher every convention?
FAN=>"By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, I shall avenge you!"
FAN=>"By Grabthar's hammer, by the-"
ALEXANDER=>Next!
GUY=>Hi everybody.
TOMMY=>Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
GUY=>Guy... You probably don't remember me do you? I was on the show in '82. Episode 31? Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial? "Crewman #6?"
GUY=>Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
GWEN=>Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
ALEXANDER=>Don't make me get a restraining order.
BRANDON=>Mr. Kwan? In episode nineteen, when the reactor fused, you used an element from Leopold Six to fix the quantum rockets. What was that called?
FRED=>Bivrakium.
BRANDON=>The blue sheath it was encased in-?
FRED=>A bi-thermal krevlite housing.
GUY=>How do you remember this stuff?
FRED=>Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
FAN=>I'm a big fan Ms. Demarco.
GWEN=>You really expect me to sign a naked picture of myself? This isn't even my body!
FAN=>Yeah, normally with fakes it's like, recycle bin. But.. This one's really good. Could you not write over the... Thanks.
GUY=>Episode 12. Killed by the lava monster?..
FAN=>Laredo, could I get an autograph?
JASON=>... on one hand, if I had moved an inch, the beast would have killed me. On the other hand, my crew was in danger...
YOUNG BOY=>How did you know what to do?
JASON=>Without a crew, I'm not a Commander.
JASON=>And we all know what happened to that beast on Enok 7...
GWEN=>You gotta admit, they do love him.
TOMMY=>Almost as much as he loves himself.
JASON=>I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
ALEXANDER=>... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
JASON=>Leadership....
TOMMY=>... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
JASON=>And determination.
GWEN=>... to playing scenes shirtless because the ladies do love Commander furry.
BRANDON=>Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
JASON=>Excuse me guys.
BRANDON=>I hadn't even gotten to the relevant conundrum...
GIRL=>Miss Demarco?... In episode 15, "Mist of Delos 5?" I got the feeling you and the Commander kind of had a thing in the swamp when you were stranded together. Did you?
GWEN=>The Commander and I NEVER had a thing.
JASON=>That's her story.
GWEN=>What?
JASON=>You smiled at me.
MATHESAR=>Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
JASON=>Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
MATHESAR=>I... certainly, but-
JASON=>Catch me later, okay?
JASON=>"Crewman Madison, I.. I'm sorry. Whatever I do next I have no control over. It's the mist on this strange planet, It's filling my head with such thoughts....
GWEN=>It was cute when I didn't know you.
BRANDON=>Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
JASON=>It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
BRANDON=>Yes but, we were wondering-
JASON=>There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship Do you get it?
GWEN=>I don't know, Alex, he's never gone quite this far before...
ALEXANDER=>I've said for years he's mentally unstable.
ALEXANDER=>Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
GWEN=>Why didn't you stop at the market?
ALEXANDER=>I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
GWEN=>You could order something in.
ALEXANDER=>A boy comes to the door.
GWEN=>I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
ALEXANDER=>Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
COMMANDER TAGGART=>As long as there is injustice, whenever a Targathian baby cries out, wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars... We'll be there. This fine ship, and this fine crew... Never give up! Never surrender!
JASON=>WHAT. DO. YOU. WANT?!
MATHESAR=>Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula. Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death... Please Captain, you are our last hope. We have secured a limousine.
JASON=>Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
MATHESAR=>Commander, standing here in your presence is the greatest honor we could ever have hoped to achieve in our lifetimes.
JASON=>Thanks, appreciate it... Anybody seen my other shoe?
NERU=>Sir, I am Neru, senior requisition officer. Before we travel to the ship, please let me know if you have any requirements. Weapons, documents, personnel...
JASON=>I could use a Coke.
TEB=>Sir, I am Teb. I would like to explain the history between our people and the Sarris Dominion in greater detail. In the 5 million years following the great nebula burst our people were one...
JASON=>What about him? Doesn't he talk?
TEB=>His translator is broken.
JASON=>Okey doke... So, listen, I had a late night with a Kreemorian Fangor Beast, so
LALIARI=>I am sorry to wake you sir, but your presence is requested on the command deck.
LALIARI=>Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline. We are approaching his ship at the Ni-delta now. He wants an answer to his proposal. I understand you have been briefed.
JASON=>Yeah, I got most of it in the car. He's the bad guy, right?
LALIARI=>Yes sir he is a very bad man indeed. He has tortured our scientists, put us to work in the gallium arsenide mines, captured our females for his own demented purposes...
JASON=>Okay I've got the picture. You have pages or do you want me to just go for it?
LALIARI=>I m not sure I...
MATHESAR=>Commander... Welcome to the Protector II. Would you like to don your uniform?
JASON=>Mind If we skip that? I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
MATHESAR=>As you wish.
JASON=>Not bad. Usually it's painted cardboard boxes in a garage.
TEB=>Sir, we apologize for operating in low power mode, but we are experiencing a reflective flux field this close to the galactic axis.
JASON=>No problem. This thing have a cup holder?
EXCITED ALIEN=>The situational analysis, Commander.
JASON=>What's your name?
EXCITED ALIEN=>...Glath sir.
NAVIGATOR=>We're approaching in five ticks, sir. Command to slow?
JASON=>Sure, set the screen saver on two. Sorry. Sorry. Didn't mean to break he mood. Slow to Mark 2, lieutenant.
SARRIS=>I see fear. That is expected. Ah, they bring a new Commander... Such a cowardly species. Not even your own kind... No matter. Here are my demands, and I would suggest, Commander, that you think well before speaking a word, because these negotiations are... tender.. and if I do not like what I hear there will be blood and pain as you cannot imagine...
SARRIS=>First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
JASON=>Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
MATHESAR=>Commander?... Where are you... going?
JASON=>Home.
MATHESAR=>You... You mean Earth?
JASON=>Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
MATHESAR=>But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
JASON=>Right. Long live... What's your planet?
MATHESAR=>Theramin.
JASON=>Long live Theramini. Take a left here?
MATHESAR=>But what if Sarris survives?
JASON=>Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
MATHESAR=>He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
JASON=>I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00. But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
MATHESAR=>An interstellar vox.
JASON=>Thanks
MATHESAR=>How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
JASON=>It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
JASON=>Wait. Where's the car?
GWEN=>Take it from us... We've been all over the universe.
FRED=>But we've never seen the space age values we've seen here .....
TOMMY=>TechCo electronics superstore
ALEXANDER=>By Grabthar's hammer, what a savings.
BRANDON=>Commander!... My apologies.
BRANDON=>Commander... Evidently we had miscommunication regarding yesterday's scheduled voyage, and-
KYLE=>He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
BRANDON=>He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
HOLLISTER=>Maybe we should just start a Star Trek club!
BRANDON=>Don't EVER say that to me again.
ALEXANDER=>Do you know what time it is? Why did you even bother to show up?
GWEN=>Jason... Are you all right?
JASON=>I was there. Up. There... They came to the convention. I thought they were fans, but they're not. They took me up to their ship. They're called Thermians or Thatians, I don't know. I was a little hungover... What they built... It's incredible I fought this man, this... THING... called Sarris. I kicked his ASS... They have these... pods. One took me THROUGH a black hole. I know. I know what you're thinking. But I can prove it. Look! They gave me this!
JASON=>Yes, but can you talk to people in SPACE on yours? Protector this is the Commander. Come in protector...
ALEXANDER=>God, what an ass.
JASON=>COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
TOMMY=>That's it, It's go time.
GWEN=>Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
JASON=>This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
GWEN=>You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
LALIARI=>Begging your pardon, Commander, we come with news. Sarris lives. He was able upon your departure to make an escape. However he has contacted us, and wishes to surrender. We humbly implore you to return with us, to negotiate the terms.
JASON=>They want me back... I... I want you all to come. You have to come with me. It'll be the most amazing experience of your lives. We1re going to negotiate an alien general's SURRENDER in SPACE. You have to- Guys? GUYS?...
JASON=>Gwen, you know me. I'm a lot of things but I'm not crazy.
JASON=>I'm ready.
TOMMY=>You should have let me hit him.
GWEN=>I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
FRED=>I think we should have taken the gig... I mean, who knows the next time he'll ask us.
GWEN=>Commander come through here?
GWEN=>We're coming too.
LALIARI=>Wonderful! The Commander had me continue transmitting in the hopes you would change your mind. Protector, requesting six Interstellar pods for immediate departure.
GWEN=>Guys... Guys?
ALEXANDER=>What in the world...?
LALIARI=>I look forward to meeting you all in person when we arrive at the ship. End transmission.
GWEN=>Oh my God. OH MY GOD.
JASON=>Guys! You CAME!...
JASON=>Okay, who wants the grand tour?
JASON=>Okay, Guy... Anybody else?
FRED=>Now that was a hell of a thing. What's wrong with them?
JASON=>That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
TOMMY=>Wh... Where are we?
JASON=>Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector. I can show you on a map.
MATHESAR=>Welcome my friends I am Mathesar. On behalf of my people I wish to thank you from the deepest place in our hearts.
MATHESAR=>Dr. Lazarus... Lt. Madison. Young Laredo, how you've grown. Tech Sgt. Chen... And....
GUY=>"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
GWEN=>You... know us?
MATHESAR=>I don't believe there is a man, woman or child on my planet who does not. In the years since we first received your ship's historical documents, we have studied every facet of your missions, technologies and strategies.
ALEXANDER=>Historical documents?
MATHESAR=>Yes. Eighteen years ago we received transmission of the first. It continued for four years, and then stopped, as mysteriously as it came...
TOMMY=>You've been watching the sho... the historical records... out HERE?
MATHE EAR=>Yes, in the last hundred years our society had fallen into disarray. Our goals, our values had become scattered. But since the transmission we have modeled many aspects of our society from your example, and it has saved us. Your courage, teamwork, friendship through the adversity...
GWEN=>THAT'S why you built this ship?
GUY=>It's ... incredible.
JASON=>Oh this? No, this isn't the ship. This is only the star port for the ship. You want to see the ship?
ALEXANDER=>Oh my god, It's real.
GWEN=>All this from watching the.. historical records?
MATHESAR=>Yes, and from your supplementary technical documents, of course...
MATHESAR=>The medical quarters are to the left...
TOMMY=>What the hell is going on?!!?
ALEXANDER=>Jason, what have you gotten us into?
GWEN=>I don't believe this, it's insane.
FRED=>Wow, the floors are REALLY clean.
JASON=>Calm down everybody. We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
ALEXANDER=>"Just!?"
MATHESAR=>Weapons storage...
JASON=>It's perfectly safe. I promise.
MATHESAR=>... Maintenance facility...
GWEN=>Jason, this is crazy! We should get out of here...
MATHESAR=>Situations room... Dining hall...
JASON=>You want to go home? Fine. Say the word, and we'll all go home and feed the fish and pay the bills and fall asleep with the t.v. on and miss out on THIS. Is that really what you want? Anybody?
JASON=>At ease men.
ALEXANDER=>Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
GUY=>I'm just jazzed to be on the show, man.'
MATHESAR=>The generator room... Our Beryllium Sphere, of course... I hope, Tech Sergeant Chen, that this meets with your approval.
FRED=>Fine... Real clean.
MATHESAR=>Tech Sgt. Chen, I am sorry to ask this of you so shortly after your arrival. But members of our reactor staff have a question they find most pressing.
FRED=>Uh huh?
LAHNK=>Sir, we have had unexplained proton surges in our delta unit. They cannot be verified on the sub frequency spectrum, but appear on the valence detector when scanning the Beryllium Sphere. We are unable to resolve this problem and were hoping you would be able to advise us.
FRED=>Uh huh... I see... Well, that's a puzzler isn't it?...
FRED=>U.... What do you think?
NERVOUS TECH=>That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
FRED=>... What does that mean?
NERVOUS TECH=>What does that mean?!!! Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
FRED=>Covalent... Right. So...
NERVOUS TECH=>So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
FRED=>OK!
LANK=>Of course! It's so obvious!
MATHESAR=>Now I suggest that you rest before we take the ship out of dock. These crewmen will escort you to your quarters.
NERU=>Here is your valence shield. Your vox. Your magneto-pistol... We know you prefer a sensitive trigger. If there is anything else you require?
TOMMY=>Uh, no, I'm good. Thanks. Oh wait. Here you go.
QUELLEK=>Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
ALEXANDER=>Well good, that's very... nice.
QUELLEK=>By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
ALEXANDER=>Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
QUELLEK=>I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
ALEXANDER=>Just don't.
QUELLEK=>...Yes sir. Your quarters sir.
ALEXANDER=>This is it?
QUELLEK=>Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
ALEXANDER=>Where's my bed?
QUELLEK=>Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
ALEXANDER=>Is that the bathroom?
QUELLEK=>Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
QUELLEK=>You're quite complicated, sir.
JASON=>It's Jason...
GWEN=>One minute I'm - Hey, I'm dressing.'
JASON=>Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
GWEN=>I just can't believe it. Any of it! Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven. Oh and wait, wait, listen to this! Computer?
COMPUTER=>Yes?
GWEN=>What's the weather like outside?
COMPUTER=>There is no weather in space.
GWEN=>I never get tired of that joke.
JASON=>Let me try. Computer? Computer?...
GWEN=>Only answers to me.
JASON=>But I'm the Commander!
GWEN=>On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
JASON=>C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
GWEN=>Wait. When are you going to tell them?
JASON=>Tell them? About...
GWEN=>Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
JASON=>Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
GWEN=>Well you have to tell them. What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
JASON=>It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF... The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
GWEN=>Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING. Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
JASON=>Hey... Hey where are you going?
GWEN=>We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
JASON=>Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
LALIARI=>Lt. Madison. The females of the ship have requested your imprint for archival purposes at the proposed Tawny Madison Institute for Computer Research.
GWEN=>The Tawny Madison Institute...
TOMMY=>What's going on?
JASON=>I think we're going to exit the space port.
GUY=>That should be something to see...
MATHESAR=>If you would all take your positions...
THE ACTORS=>Oh, right... US! Yes, of course... US!
TOMMY=>Look.. This thingy... I remember I had it all worked out. This was forward, back...
MATHESAR=>Commander, some of the crew has requested to be present at this historic event.
TOMMY=>No pressure, huh? Glad I'm not the Commander.
COMMANDER=>Okay, Lareo, take her out.
TOMMY=>Excuse me?
JASON=>They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
TOMMY=>Right. Okay, yeah, sure.
TOMMY=>Oh god. Oh my god....
GUY=>More to the left... Stay parallel...
TOMMY=>Hey, YOU want to drive?
TOMMY=>Oh shit.
JASON=>Very good Lieutenant. Forward Mark two...
TOMMY=>Mark two, Commander.
MATHESAR=>To our brave guests. Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes. We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
JASON=>Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
TEB=>We are sorry about the instrumentation, Lt. Laredo. There must have been a malfunction in the steerage mechanism.
TOMMY=>Just see that it doesn't happen again.
TEB=>Yes sir. How are you enjoying your food, Lt. Madison?
GWEN=>Oh it's fantastic. French is my favorite.
TEB=>Yes, we programed the food synthesizer for each of you based on the regional menu of your birthplace. Are you enjoying your Kep-mok bloodticks Dr. Lazarus?
ALEXANDER=>Just like mother used to make.
JASON=>The beast ROARED as I PLUNGED the knife again and again... I held on for dear life as it thrashed about! And that was
ALEXANDER=>Tell me, Mathesar, this Sarris bloke we're flying to meet... What is it he wants exactly?
MATHESAR=>For years, Sarris has plundered the resources of our planet. Our people, our technologies. We built this ship in order to find a new planet to settle. One far away from Sarris. We are not a people accustomed to confrontation. We are scientists. This ship was our salvation.
MATHESAR=>But Sarris found out about our plans just as we had completed construction of the
GUY=>The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
GWEN=>The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
TOMMY=>What is it? What does it do?
MATHESAR=>We don't know.
GWEN=>But... You built one, right?
TEB=>We built... something... from the blueprints and what references we could find on your internet... Our computer neural nets made educated guesses in areas we were uncertain. So there is actually much about the device we don't even understand. We were hoping you could enlighten us.
JASON=>Well, it's... This was a device we... discovered on an alien planet. We don't know what it does either.
TOMMY=>Why don't you just turn it on and see?
TEB=>It has at its heart a reactor capable of generating unthinkable energy. If we were mistaken in our construction by even the slightest calculation, the device would act as a molecular explosive, causing a chain reaction that would obliterate all matter in the universe.
ALEXANDER=>Let me at the switch.
JASON=>Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
MATHESAR=>NO, Thank God he has not.
JASON=>Then how did he find out about the device?
MATHESAR=>Our former Commander was not... Strong.
JASON=>Former Commander?
MATHESAR=>I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
MATHESAR=>The tape was partially demagnetized as it was smuggled off of Sarris' ship.
MATHESAR=>Originally, one of our own tried to lead...
SARRIS=>Is that all? You have no more to confess to me? No? After three days of this you still require incentive?
ALIEN COMMANDER=>I say again... I have told you all I know. To my shame, I have told you everything. If you have any mercy within you, please, let me die.
SARRIS=>Oh I shall, I shall... When I grow weary of the noises you make, my little plaything, be assured, you shall die...
GWEN=>We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
JASON=>Let me think. I need time to think.
ALEXANDER=>He wants to THINK!?
TOMMY=>No, Jason, that's a wrap! There's nothing to think about!
GUY=>Listen, I'm not even supposed to BE here. I'm just Crewman #6. I'm expendable. I'm the guy in the episode who dies to prove that the situation is serious! I'm leaving NOW.
MATHESAR=>Commander...
JASON=>Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
GWEN=>Your crew? What about you?
MATHESAR=>Begging your Commander's pardon, sir, but we cannot launch pods at the moment. Sarris will surely detonate any objects leaving the ship. Yes sir, he's
GWEN=>There's nobody here. Jason...
JASON=>Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
MATHESAR=>I thank you for your consideration to our pride, but while my people are talented scientists our attempts to operate our own technologies under tactical simulation have been disastrous.
MATHESAR=>I have raised Sarris on zeta frequency.
GWEN=>Uh... Great. Thanks.
JASON=>Still, Mathesar, your crew may nonetheless be helpful in certain-
SARRIS=>We meet again Commander.
JASON=>Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
SARRIS=>Better than my Lieutenant. He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
JASON=>Right. Well... Listen, I'm I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding. I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh... ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
SARRIS=>Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
JASON=>Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
SARRIS=>You have ten seconds.
JASON=>All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now. Just give me a moment to set it up.
JASON=>All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
GWEN=>Jason..
JASON=>We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
GWEN=>JASON...
JASON=>You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
GUY=>...Okay
JASON=>All right. Put me back on with him.
GWEN=>I'm trying to tell you. You ARE on with him.
SARRIS=>Perhaps I am not as stupid as I am ugly, Commander.
JASON=>I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
GWEN=>I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
JASON=>Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
SARRIS=>Of course not...
GUY=>Guys... Red thingy moving toward the green thingy. Red thingy moving toward the green thingy!
JASON=>What?
GUY=>I think we're the green thingy.
SARRIS=>A present for you, Commander.
COMMANDER=>Shit. Turn. Gun it' Get out of-
JASON=>We've gotta get out of here!
TOMMY=>Where?
JASON=>Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
GWEN=>They're turning. They're COMING.
COMPUTER=>The ship is sustaining structural damage.
GWEN=>Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
JASON=>Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
TOMMY=>It's as far as it goes!
GUY=>They're still behind us...
JASON=>We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
TOMMY=>Could be this.
JASON=>Push It. Hold it down.
COMPUTER=>The enemy is matching velocity.
GWEN=>The enemy is matching velocity.
ALEXANDER=>We heard it the first time!
GWEN=>Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
FRED=>Hi guys. Listen, they're telling me that the generators won't take it, the ship's breaking apart and all that. Just FYI.
ALEXANDER=>We've got to stop!
JASON=>We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
ALEXANDER=>You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
JASON=>Like YOU know?
GWEN=>I remember that sound! That's a bad sound!
JASON=>Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
GWEN=>I don't think that's a cloud...
JASON=>Mathesar? What is that?
MATHESAR=>It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of
ALEXANDER=>May I get the check?
GWEN=>The ships are gaining...
JASON=>Do your best, Tommy...
TOMMY=>Oh god...
ALEXANDER=>Could you possibly try not to hit every single one!
TOMMY=>They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
LATHE=>Continue forward, sir?
SARRIS=>Patience, Lt. . Patience.
JASON=>We're almost through... Come on... Hold...
ALEXANDER=>WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
GWEN=>FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
JASON=>NO! WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
ALEXANDER=>DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
JASON=>KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
TOMMY=>WHAT DO IT DO? WHAT DO IT DO?
ALEXANDER=>What's happened?
TOMMY=>The engines are dead. We're drifting.
JASON=>Are they behind us?
GWEN=>No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but... Something is. Oh my god.
JASON=>DOWN!
JASON=>Are you all right? Tommy. Where's Tommy?
TOMMY=>It's broke... Oh God... Oh God...
MATHESAR=>I'll take him to medical quarters.
ALEXANDER=>"Go into the cloud! ...
GWEN=>Alex? Where are you going?
ALEXANDER=>To see if there's a pub.
COMPUTER=>...Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage... Left vector guards, 96% damage... Level 5 structural breaches in quadrants 32, 34, 40, 43, 58...
GWEN=>Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
COMPUTER=>The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
GWEN=>It's fractured...
JASON=>Can it be repaired?
GWEN=>Computer, can it be repaired?
COMPUTER=>Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
GWEN=>We need another one.
GUY=>Shit, the Beryllium sphere. That's bad...
ALEXANDER=>You broke the ship. You broke the bloody SHIP! I told you you don't hold down a turbo. You push it once, maybe twice for a boost but you don't HOLD it.
JASON=>Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
GWEN=>Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
COMPUTER=>Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
GWEN=>No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
TOMMY=>You know, that's really getting annoying.
GWEN=>I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
TOMMY=>Sure, no problem.
MATHESAR=>A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
JASON=>You what?.. What are you talking about?
MATHESAR=>We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
JASON=>No... Listen, Mathesar. it's not your fault. We're... We're...
GWEN=>We're not the people you think we are.
MATHESAR=>I don't understand.
ALEXANDER=>Mathesar, don't you have television on your planet? Theater? Films?
MATHESAR=>The historical documents of your culture... Yes, in fact we have begun to
GWEN=>No not historical documents... They're not all historical documents... I mean... surely you don't think Gilligan's Island is a...
MATHESAR=>Those poor people...
TOMMY=>Hoo boy...
GWEN=>Does no one on your planet behave in a way that is contrary to reality?
MATHESAR=>Ah. You speak of...
MATHESAR=>"Deception..." "Lies."
JASON=>Well... Sort of...
MATHESAR=>We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost. But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
MATHESAR=>You are our protectors... Our heroes. You will save us.
FRED=>Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
JASON=>I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
FRED=>Correct! Gold star for you and a gold star for you...
QUELLEK=>Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper. I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
ALEXANDER=>Thanks.
QUELLEK=>Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
ALEXANDER=>Uh uh! What did we talk about?
QUELLEK=>Right... Sorry, sir.
GUY=>I changed my mind. I want to go back.
ALEXANDER=>After the big fuss you made about not getting left behind on the ship?
GUY=>Yeah, but that's when I thought maybe was the crewman that stays on the shin and something is up there and it kills me, but now I'm thinking I'm the guy who gets killed by some monster five minutes after we land on the planet...
JASON=>Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
GUY=>Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
JASON=>Your last name.
GUY=>Yeah, what is it?
JASON=>It's... I don't know.
GUY=>No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
GWEN=>Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
GUY=>Do I? DO I? For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"! Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
GUY=>See? I'm the hysterical guy who needs to be slapped, and then I die!
ALEXANDER=>Are we there yet?
TOMMY=>Autopilot.
GUY=>What are you doing! You don't just open the door! It's an alien planet! Is there air!? You don't know, do you!
FRED=>Seems okay.
JASON=>Which way, Alex?
ALEXANDER=>This way... Wait, no, that way...
TOMMY=>You were holding it upside down weren't you?
ALEXANDER=>Shut up.
TOMMY=>You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
ALEXANDER=>You think you could do better "Laredo?"
TOMMY=>Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
GUY=>We're screwed... We're so screwed...
JASON=>All right, let's all settle down. If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
GWEN=>Self control? That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
JASON=>Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
GWEN=>I could have held on to YOU! ...
ALEXANDER=>We re really going to do this HERE?
JASON=>How much further?
ALEXANDER=>About this much.
JASON=>What's the scale? Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
ALEXANDER=>THIS much.
GUY=>It's got me it's got me! See? FIVE MINUTES! I told you!
GUY=>Something grabbed me! IT DID.
JASON=>Easy son. It's just your imagination. Hang tough.
GWEN=>You're playing your good side.
JASON=>Don't be ridiculous.
ALEXANDER=>And note the sucked in gut.
TOMMY=>...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
FRED=>It's the rugged pose.
GUY=>That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
JASON=>Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
JASON=>There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
ALEXANDER=>Must be some sort of mining facility.
GWEN=>Where are the miners?
GUY=>Something BAD happened here.
TOMMY=>Will you relax?
GWEN=>Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
ALEXANDER=>Could they be the miners?
FRED=>Sure. They're like, three years old.
ALEXANDER=>MINERS, not MINORS.
FRED=>You Okay, Alex?
GUY=>I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
GWEN=>Oh, they're so cute.
GUY=>Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
EVERYONE=>Awwww..... It's hurt...
GWEN=>Hi!... Hi there little guy...
GUY=>Jesus, didn't ANY of you watch the show!?
ALIEN CHILDREN=>Gorignak... Gorignak.... Nak nak!
GWEN=>Aw, look. They're helping the hurt one...
GUY=>I am SO SICK of being right.
GWEN=>Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
JASON=>We gotta get that sphere, or we aren't going anywhere.
JASON=>All right... here's the plan: First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere. Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
GWEN=>Why does this sound so familiar?
TOMMY=>"Assault on Voltareck III." Episode... 31 I think.
GUY=>We're doing episode 31?
TOMMY=>Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
GWEN=>How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
GUY=>We're doing episode 31, Jason?
JASON=>It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
GUY=>Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
JASON=>It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
GUY=>BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
ALEXANDER=>This is ludicrous. Why are you listening to this man? Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?... He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow. No offense.
TOMMY=>You have a better plan, Alex?
ALEXANDER=>As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
JASON=>As I was saying... Fred, we need some sort of diversion. Some sort of Hologram or optical illusion or...
FRED=>A hologram...
JASON=>Never mind, Fred....
FRED=>No, no... I'll think on it...
GWEN=>Jason, look.
TOMMY=>They're gone.
GUY=>Where'd they go? Back inside?
GWEN=>I don't know.
ALEXANDER=>Nobody was WATCHING?
JASON=>All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me. Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
TOMMY=>What kind of signal?
JASON=>Anything.
TOMMY=>Okay, I'll do this... "Caw Caw!"
JASON=>Tommy, we have these...
TOMMY=>Oh, right, sorry.
JASON=>Okay, let's go.
TOMMY=>You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
GUY=>Not a clue. You?
TOMMY=>I think he just likes pointing at things.
GWEN=>How does the rolling help, actually?
JASON=>It helps.
GWEN=>Where's your gun?
ALEXANDER=>"It helps."
GWEN=>Those blue things ate everybody here?
ALEXANDER=>It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
MINER=>Gorignak!... Gorignak!...
JASON=>Anybody want to wait around to find out what a "Gorignak" is?
GWEN=>Clenched jaw...
JASON=>Will you stop RIDING ME?!
GUY=>I know what it is... I know what it is... It's not what's ON the planet. It IS the planet...
GUY=>There's a life force here. The blue things... Did you see how they moved? Careful. Quiet. Like they didn't want something DISTURBED....
TOMMY=>Oh. Shit.
JASON=>C'mon, push! Never give up, never surrender!
EVERYONE=>Oh shut up!..
ALEXANDER=>Spare me.
TOMMY=>Sorry Guys... It just went off.
JASON=>Good work, Tommy. Let's go!
JASON=>Don't look back. DO NOT look back.
ALEXANDER=>Go ahead!
JASON=>You go first! There's no time!
ALEXANDER=>Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
JASON=>Tommy, I'm in, push go now!
GWEN=>Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
TOMMY=>I can't... It's on autopilot!...
ALEXANDER=>He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
GWEN=>Down there.
ALEXANDER=>Oh right, of course... It's always about YOU, isn't it?!
DEMON=>Gorignak...
GWEN=>We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals! Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
TOMMY=>That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough. Face it, he's dead.
GWEN=>Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
FRED=>...The digital conveyor.
GUY=>Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
TOMMY=>Do we have one of those, Teb?
ALEXANDER=>You said "the Commander.
GWEN=>What?
ALEXANDER=>Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
GWEN=>No I didn't.
ALEXANDER=>Yes you did.
TOMMY=>I heard it too.
GWEN=>Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
DEMONS=>Gorignak... Gorignak.
GWEN=>Jason.. Can you hear me?
JASON=>Yes. Yes, I'm here!
GWEN=>Thank God. Are you okay?
JASON=>Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
GWEN=>Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
JASON=>The digital conveyer? You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
FRED=>Right.
JASON=>I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
GWEN=>Jason, we've got to get you out of there. It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb?
TEB=>It has never been successfully tested.
JASON=>What? What did he say?
GWEN=>Nothing. Hold please.
TEB=>Theoretically the mechanism is fully operational. However, it was built to accommodate your anatomy, not ours. Our actual hands are six fingered and jointed ninety degrees to yours. But now that Sergeant Chen is here he can operate it... It was designed watching his motions from the historical records.
FRED=>Well I mean I can't... I can supervise of course, but...
ALEXANDER=>Jason, we're going to test it.
JASON=>Okay... On what?
TOMMY=>How about the pig-lizard?
JASON=>Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
TEB=>I'm sorry. It is very exciting to see the master at the controls. The operation of the conveyer is more art than science.
JASON=>What? What?
ALEXANDER=>Nothing.
JASON=>I heard something. A squeal.
GWEN=>Oh no. Everything's fine.
TEB=>But... the animal is inside out.
JASON=>I heard that! It's INSIDE OUT!
TEB=>And It exploded!
JASON=>What? Did I just hear that It came back INSIDE CUT, and 'then It EXPLODED? Hello?
GWEN=>Hold please.
JASON=>Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
GWEN=>Turn on the translation circuit.
DEMONS=>ROCK... ROCK... ROCK...
GWEN=>Jason?... I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
JASON=>What the hell are you talking about?
JASON=>Oh darn.
JASON=>Guys, digitize me...
JASON=>Guys...?!!
GWEN=>C' non Fred... They based it on YOUR hand movements.
FRED=>All my professional life they'd say "can you ride a horse" Fred? And I'd say "Of course, since I was a boy!" "Can you fence Fred?" "Funny you should ask, I've won six international competitions." I learned never to say I can't do this. You don't get the part if you say I can't do this. But this is life or death! May God forgive me Jason but I can't do this.
ALEXANDER=>Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
JASON=>KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
TOMMY=>Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
JASON=>It doesn't have eyes.
TOMMY=>The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
JASON=>It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
GUY=>I know... You contruct a weapon. Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
JASON=>A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
JASON=>ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
ALEXANDER=>... . Well you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
JASON=>It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
ALEXANDER=>That's your problem. You were never serious about the caraft... "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this? Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT. VIBRATIONS. Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
JASON=>Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
JASON=>But I'm not moving, I... Oh no. My heartbeat.
JASON=>Fred? Fred, can you hear me? You've got to do this... It's up to you.
FRED=>No, I'll kill you. .
JASON=>Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
FRED=>I don't know... I don't know.
JASON=>Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
FRED=>You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
JASON=>Digitize me, Fred.
ALEXANDER=>I see you managed to get your shirt off.
FRED=>As good as Hopkins?
JASON=>Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
JASON=>All right folks, let's get the hell out of here...
JASON=>Mathesar, we're back up and on our way to the command deck. Mathesar? Come in Mathesar? Teb? Quellek? What's going on? Where is everybody?
TOMMY=>NO NO NO.
JASON=>We've got to get out of here. C'mon, hurry
JASON=>Listen Sarris, just hold on, just-
SARRIS=>If you cannot walk, Commander, then I suggest you crawl.
MATHESAR=>Commander. Thank God you're alive... Now you will face justice, Sarris.
SARRIS=>At every turn you demonstrate the necessity for your extermination. The qualities of your species... Ridiculous optimism, like little children. Building, always building. But what you spend years to create, I take from you in days. Do you wish to save this man's life, Commander? And the life of your crew?
JASON=>Yes.
SARRIS=>Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega
JASON=>I don't know.
SARRIS=>Is it a bomb? A booby trap? Tell me!
JASON=>Stop, please! I don't know!
SARRIS=>Prepare a tear harness for the female...
JASON=>No! I swear I don't know! Please!
SARRIS=>Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
JASON=>But I'm not! I... I'm not the Commander!
SARRIS=>Wait. What did you say?
JASON=>Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
SARRIS=>Explain -
JASON=>Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
GWEN=>Computer, play the historical records of the GALAXY QUEST missions.
SARRIS=>Oh, this is wonderful. Wonderful. I treated you as a foe, but no... You have done greater damage to these poor fools than I ever could have. Bravo!... Bravo!
SARRIS=>Tell him. This is a moment I will treasure. Explain who you really are.
JASON=>My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
SARRIS=>Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
JASON=>We pretend...
SARRIS=>Simpler.
JASON=>We.. We lie.
SARRIS=>Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
JASON=>I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
MATHESAR=>But there it is!...
JASON=>A model, only as big as this.
MATHESAR=>But... Inside, I have seen-
JASON=>Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations. It's all a fake. I'm not him... I'm a nothing. A nobody.
MATHESAR=>But...Why?
JASON=>It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
JASON=>That's how I make my living. Pretending to be somebody else. Pretending to be Commander Peter Quincy Taggart... I'm... I'm so sorry Mathesar...
SARRIS=>Now you know. This entire world you've concocted. All based on nothing. Your beliefs... your hopes... All a dream. A wisp of smoke. Now there is only pain.
SARRIS=>Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
LATHE=>The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
MATHESAR=>Sarris. What about my men?
SARRIS=>I guess an actor is not the same as a Commander after all.
SARRIS=>Release them, Sergeant... Into space.
COMPUTER VOICE=>Core overload. Emergency shut down overridden. Core implosion estimated in nine minutes...
ALEXANDER=>Well, how does it feel, Jason? Was it worth it? Hundreds of innocents to die because of you... How does it feel?
ALEXANDER=>Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
JASON=>Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
FRED=>Hmmm. . A little sticky. I'll get one of my boys up here with a can of WD-40.
ALEXANDER=>"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
JASON=>I was staying in character. "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
ALEXANDER=>Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
JASON=>I had the shot...
GWEN=>Guys...
JASON=>Let's go.
COMPUTER VOICE=>Core implosion in four minutes...
JASON=>Go on, give it a try, Gwen.
GWEN=>computer, shut own the core.
COMPUTER VOICE=>Unable. Memory checksum invalid. Core systems hardware damaged.
JASON=>All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on. Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
TOMMY=>Jason? What about me? What do I do?
JASON=>Practice driving, Tommy.
TOMMY=>Practice driving?
GWEN=>So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
JASON=>Right.
GWEN=>Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
JASON=>No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
BRANDON'S MOM=>Brandon?
BRANDON=>Mother, I'm quite busy as you can see. The "C" rings on my booster unit came broken In the mail.
BRANDON'S MOM=>I'm sorry. - made brownies.
BRANDON=>Mother, I'm very busy. Well, maybe one. Thank you.
JASON=>Hello?... Hello is anyone there?...
BRANDON=>... Hello? BRANDON
JASON=>This Is Jason Nesmith. I play Commander Peter Quincy Taggart of the USEA PROTECTOR.
BRANDON=>... Yes?
JASON=>We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
BRANDON=>Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
JASON=>What's your name, son?
BRANDON=>Brandon.
JASON=>Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
BRANDON=>Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
JASON=>It's okay. Listen-
BRANDON=>... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
JASON=>It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
BRANDON=>I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
JASON=>Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
LATHE=>General, your transport is ready for departure.
QUELLEK=>Sir, it's you Thank Ipthar!
ALEXANDER=>Quellek. What are you doing in there?
QUELLEK=>I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze. Where is everyone?
ALEXANDER=>Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
JASON=>Okay we're in C deck hallway 5. What now?
BRANDON=>Okav, there's a haton on the port wall. It leads to a system of utility corridors through the bowels of the shop.
JASON=>There's no hatch. There's no hatch!
GWEN=>Wait... Jason, Here!...
JASON=>Okay, we got it.
BRANDON=>Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
KYLE=>Hi Brandon.
BRANDON=>No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
KYLE=>Oh. Okay.
BRANDON=>You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
KYLE=>I have sectors 1-28. I think Hector has the upper levels.
BRANDON=>We'd better get everybody online. And Kyle, Stop downloading porn. Your frame rate is unacceptable.
KYLE=>I'm not downloading porn!
FRED=>Okay, sector 38... 39... 40. This is it. The environmental systems are in here. All we have to do is shut off the valve to the barracks...
BOTH TOMMYS=>Pedal to the metal, Commander....
BRANDON=>Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units. Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
JASON=>Okay... Okay, now what.
BRANDON=>Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility. The bowels of the ship.
BRANDON=>Commander, do you have a camera? I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
JASON=>We'd never have the budget for this.
BRANDON=>Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
JASON=>Yes...?
BRANDON=>Okay, that's where you want to be.
AUELLEX=>They're dying!
ALLXANDER=>Here. Help me tear this down, we can use it as a battering ram.
ALEXANDER=>Don't worry, Quellek, it'll be okay...
FRED=>We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
GUY=>Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this... may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
FRED=>It's suicide.
GUY=>I'm just a glorified extra, Fred. I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
FRED=>Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
FRED=>Besides, just had a really interesting idea.
TRANSPORT CHIEF=>Sir, the FALCON THREE Is launched and away, course set for Xactor Minor. FALCON ONE ahead. Four minutes to core overload.
SARRIS=>Good... Good... All is in its place.
TRANSPORT CHIEF=>General, I have just received word that the Commander of the PROTECTOR and his command crew have escaped custody. Their whereabouts are unknown.
SARRIS=>What?
SARRIS=>Find them.
LATHE=>But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
SARRIS=>Find them.
JASON=>We've cleared the robot arms. Now what?
KATELYN=>Okay, Brandon, as I calculate it the shortest route is down the ladder near the quark accelerators.
OTHER NERDS=>I concur. She's right. Very good.
BRANDON=>High five, Katelyn.
JASON=>Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
BRANDON=>Yes Commander?
JASON=>What does the Omega 13 do?
BRANDON=>Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
JASON=>What do you mean?
BRANDON=>It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
JASON=>But you don't?
BRANDON=>No, I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
JASON=>How did you come to that conclusion?
BRANDON=>My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman. He's seen it 13 times...
KYLE=>As you know I strenuously disagree with this theory, Brandon. if all molecules were rearranged, then everyone would be back in time 13 seconds rendering the device useless.
JASON=>Okay guys... Guys?
KATELYN=>No because the brain of the person who triggers the Omega 13 is not affected, so THAT person still has his memory after the time jump. And everything is as it was, a chance to redeem a single mistake or misstep.
BRANDON=>Thank you, Katelyn. Excellent.
KATELYN=>You're welcome, Brandon.
JASON=>BRANDON! TIME TO GO!
BRANDON=>Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
GWEN=>"The chompers?"
GWEN=>Oh, fuck THAT.
JASON=>Brandon, HOW?
BRANDON=>Hollister, do you have the sequence yet?
HOLLISTER=>Okay, the pattern is two.. two... four... two... three... eight... two...
BRANDON=>You're sure they repeat like that? It's sort of extremely important.
GWEN=>What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
JASON=>Gwen...
GWEN=>We shouldn't have to DO this! It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
JASON=>Because it was on the show!
GWEN=>Well forget it! I'm not going. This episode was badly written!
BRANDON=>Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
JASON=>Okay, now. But-
BRANDON=>Wait two seconds then go.
JASON=>No, wait, are you-
BRANDON=>Lt. Madison, GO.
JASON=>Shit! Go!
BRANDON=>GO Commander.
BRANDON=>Stop.
BRANDON=>Go. They're off again.
BRANDON=>Up.
JASON=>What? Up?
BRANDON=>Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
GWEN=>Whoever wrote this episode should DIE.
DARKNESS=>Jason and Gwen run through pitch blackness.
JASON=>What the hell?... Brandon, Where are we?
GWEN=>Great... Just great.'
GUY=>This should be Interesting...
FRED=>It's the simple things In life you treasure.
ROCK MONSTER=>Ah, sweet tranquility at last.
QUELLEK=>Sir! The pressure. It's normalizing.
ALEXANDER=>Open.
ALIENS=>Hooray for Commander Taggart! Long live Commander Taggart!
ALEXANDER=>It's just not fair.
ALEXANDER=>Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
QUELLEK=>I'm... I'm shot.
ALEXANDER=>Quellek... Quellek!
ALEXANDER=>Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
QUELLEK=>I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
ALEXANDER=>No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
QUELLEK=>... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you. LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning. I have been blessed. Sir, I... I...
ALEXANDER=>Don't speak, Quellek.
QUELLEK=>You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
ALEXANDER=>Quellek... By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan... You shall be avenged.
