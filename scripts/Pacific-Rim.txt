FLICK=>I can't, Yance. YANCY
PENTECOST=>Lieutenant-Commander Stacker Pentecost.
RALEIGH=>Due respect, sir, but I've been through training.
MAKO=>What's he like? KAORI
CAGE ELEVATOR=>and shuts the door. As they ride it down, Raleigh doesn't take his eyes off the second Jaeger. The lift bottoms out on
THE MAIN FLOOR=>where Pentecost and Raleigh exit. Raleigh narrows his eyes at the obscured mech: something about the color intrigues him.
PENTECOST=>Lieutenant Mori, stand down!
TOYNBEE=>I’m glad you did.
FLICK=>Is that strange?
RALEIGH=>I'd believe you...
PENTECOST=>Visibility low. It's all soup.
PENTECOST=>Nothing. Stay focused, Roma-1.
RALEIGH=>Mako, is that you?
PENTECOST=>It’s Roma team, sir.
BACK TO PRESENT=>Mako's hand tightens on his shoulder, a reflex. She winces but keeps dancing. Neither dares to meet the other's eyes. The ethereal music leads them in tense, wandering circles. The ghost-drift sweeps over them in a storm of images and sounds, fragments chaotically tumbling over one another. MONTAGE -- GHOST-DRIFT -- The Jaeger COYOTE TANGO stands in the shallow surf near the Santa Monica Pier. Blood-red dusk spreads from the setting sun. Gore-stained water streaks the wide beach.
YOUNG MAKO=>He's not coming back.
RALEIGH=>I dunno... Probably not.
BACK TO PRESENT=>Raleigh stares into space as they dance, dwelling on his guilt. He glances down and notices Mako looking right up at him, her eyes softened with an empathic sadness. They keep dancing, and without a word, Mako rests her head on Raleigh's shoulder as the band sings, "Til the last beat / Til the last fleeting beat / Of my heart..." Pentecost watches from the shadows. He nods to himself and lets out a small sigh of relief.
MAKO=>We should practice the steps. We'll be tested soon.
MAKO=>We'll be ready.
NEWT=>I’m just trying to help.
NEWT=>No, this is it.
LOUDSPEAKER=>Roma Roma Roma - condition red. Repeat - Roma Unit to ready stations. This is not a drill.
RALEIGH=>What did you say?
DUC=>We'd be finer.
CAGE ELEVATOR=>and turns to spell it out for Duc.
THE MAIN FLOOR=>where he bursts out and jogs to Gipsy Danger. He finds Raleigh and Mako climbing into their conn-pods at the foot of the docking tower.
MAKO=>-- Yes, Sensei.
RALEIGH=>Thank you, Sensei. They both strap on their helmets and give the signal. The canopy on the conn-pods slides closed, sealing them in their self-contained control capsules. The loading arms CLATTER up the tower, hoisting the conn-pods up to their loading positions on the Jaeger. The lower arm swings to deposit Mako's pod on the Jaeger's spine, which hangs out like a ramp to draw the pod inside the torso before closing over it. The armor BUCKLES shut. INT. CONN-POD ROMA-2 -- CONTINUOUS Without the display activated, the cockpit is cramped and dark. Mako shuts her eyes and breathes deep as she feels the pod SHUDDER and LOCK into place. INT. JAEGER LAUNCH BAY -- CONTINUOUS The upper arm deposits Raleigh's pod into the Jaeger's open neck. As the pod sinks into the mech, the Jaeger's head GROANS back into place and LOCKS closed over the slot. INT. CONN-POD ROMA-1 -- CONTINUOUS Raleigh nervously hums "Reaching for the Moon" as he runs through his pre-launch checks. INT. JAEGER LAUNCH BAY -- CONTINUOUS The Jumphawks lower cables to the Jaeger where TECHNICIANS in safety orange vests, so small on the machine's mighty shoulders, hook the ends to latches on the mech's armor. The Jumphawks rise, their engines ROARING to full power, and the lift-cables go taut, straining until the incredible machine begins to lift off the ground. INT. CONN-POD ROMA-1 -- CONTINUOUS A friendly TONE precedes a soothing DIGITAL VOICE.
TAKADA=>Is the Pons hot?
MAKO=>Comes flooding back...
RALEIGH=>He wants to know if you understand what he's saying.
DUC=>Fair point...
RALEIGH=>What did she say?
RALEIGH=>First kill, right?
CZERNY=>See for yourself.
THROUGH THE LENSES=>clearly sees a 3D projection hanging in the air before the glowing monitor: a hidden holographic interface, invisible without the reading glasses. Finding he can manipulate the data with his hands, Newt opens folders, probing deeper and deeper into Czerny's database...
THE ANTEVERSE=>as Flick sees it. The images have a jittery quality. And the sound, drowned and THROBBING with TINNITUS, clots like syrup in our ears. It feels intrinsically unstable. We find ourselves suddenly perched at a vertiginous height. Miles below us, a dark and bitter alien world. The wind tosses frosty veils of hoarfrost under a blank sky -- a wide and star-less pall, black as pitch. A dead sun hangs over the horizon like a bare lightbulb -- an ashen sphere, cracked by rivers of cold, cruel light. An expanse of frigid ocean, divided into wide sunken pens, clear to the horizon -- like an inconceivably vast fish farm. The wide sea steams with desperate breaths. Nightmarish life SEETHES in the water, packed tight as entrails. Clambering talons, slithering tentacles, jaws GASPING. The sea steams with their ragged breaths. Kaiju. All kaiju. Far as the eye can see. An unfathomable mass of monstrous violence. A fine grid of walkways overlays the pens, upon which we glimpse the PRECURSORS from afar. Spare, skeletal figures, like the rarefied inhabitants of an architectural sketch, minuscule against the vast Darwinian chaos below them. BACK IN THE BACKROOM
THE JEEP=>and straps her into the passenger's seat, before climbing in, twisting the ignition, and throttling it so hard that
THE REAR WHEELS=>spin up plumes of red dust, before catching and launching the vehicle up the road. INT. JEEP -- CONTINUOUS Newt's frantic eyes dart between the twisting desert road and the compound's gate, shrinking in his rearview mirror. Flick gags. Her body convulses in her seat. Her back arches as if her spine wants to break her in half. She falls limp. Newt reaches over to feel her pulse as he drives.
PENTECOST=>Well the tower puts your property damage in the red...
MAKO=>Because it's the part that hurts when you can't.
BACK TO PRESENT=>The NOISE of the memory echoes as Raleigh pulls himself up to sit on the edge of the bed, his face in his hands.
DISPATCH=>Your target is designated KJ Komodo. Category-4.
KAORI=>Three seconds will sap the reserves.
TAKADA=>You’re saying --
PENTECOST=>Just like you asked.
TAKADA=>Yes, Gipsy Danger has been deployed. We are not under attack. We are the attackers. To clarify --
DISPATCH=>Three category-5 hostiles inbound... Reporting names -- Scunner, Pharaoh, and Tengu...
DUC=>Flash freeze!
RALEIGH=>All we have to do is fall.
