GALADRIEL=>Seven to the Dwarf Lords: great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
GALADRIEL=>For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race.
GALADRIEL=>...and into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.
GALADRIEL=>But the power of the Ring could not be undone.
GALADRIEL=>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated.
GALADRIEL=>The Ring passed to Isildur ... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.
GALADRIEL=>Until, when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer.
GALADRIEL=>The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.
GALADRIEL=>The Ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave...
GALADRIEL=>It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable...
GANDALF=>Just tea, thank you.
PIPPIN=>This was your idea.
BILBO=>Goodbye, Gandalf.
INTOXICATED HOBBIT=>Goodnight, sweet maiden of the golden ale!
FRODO=>Take it! Take it!
GANDALF=>You know this? How?
MERRY=>Sam, hold this...
FRODO=>What do you want?
STRIDER=>They were once Men.
MERRY=>He’s foul enough.
SARUMAN=>We have work to do.
GANDALF=>I am sorry, Frodo.
ELROND=>The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we’ve gone? The Dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.
ELROND=>Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
GANDALF=>Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
LEGOLAS=>And you have my bow.
FRODO=>What do you mean?
GIMLI=>No...no...oh, no!
FRODO=>Aragorn! Aragorn!
LEGOLAS=>We should leave now.
LEGOLAS=>The horn of Gondor!
