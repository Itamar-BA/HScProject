NEWSREADER=>As yet POLICE have not ruled out the possibility that this mutilated body could be connected with the murder of NICKI LOWE, whose body was found on Hapthron Common last month. Last night, novelist ELLEN CARTER was awarded the International Writers Guild Award for her Book, 'The Colour of fear'...
NEWSREADER=>She was said to be ecstatic about the award...
CARTER=>Hello CRIME SCENE - yes, that's me...
CARTER=>No - I'm sorry I haven't made my payments - Friday - Fine - OK?
CARTER=>No - I wont use the card... Fine... Thank you - goodbye...
CARTER=>Could you do me a colour photocopy of this now?
DEZERAE=>Which do you think is her best shot...
CARTER=>The one on the left - definitely...
DEZERAE=>Don't give me shit - what do you want?
CARTER=>I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
DEZERAE=>As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
DEZERAE=>Good - but change 'I killed for love' to 'I killed for sex'
CARTER=>That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
DEZERAE=>You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
CARTER=>I heard something like that
DEZERAE=>Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
DEZERAE=>I don't want to hear it...Now get out - I've got deadlines
CARTER=>I wouldn't choose either...
ANDY=>I thought it might look better enlarged!
CARTER=>Could you fax this to this number as quickly as possible.
CARTER=>It's the photo I have just faxed to your wife...
LANCE=>What!?
WORKER=>LANCE - Your wife is on line 3!
CARTER=>Send her my love...
CARTER=>Please be in and have tidied the house...
CARTER=>I thought you said you could get the afternoon off to tidy the house!
MIK=>I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
CARTER=>At 2.00...
MIK=>You didn't tell me her name.
CARTER=>LESLIE...
STECKLER=>STECKLER...LESLIE STECKLER.
STECKLER=>I like it...
CARTER=>You see MR STECKLER, er, I think that we may have wasted your time. I don't know why I didn't say something earlier - It's just that we're looking for a girl...The advert was for a girl.
STECKLER=>Well - the ad just said third person... It must have been a printing error.
STECKLER=>It doesn't mention 'females only'
CARTER=>I really don't know what to say
STECKLER=>I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
MIK=>Surgery? Are you a doctor?
STECKLER=>No - a dentist
STECKLER=>I have all my references ready - and I can pay the first month and deposit now. It really is a glowing reference!
CARTER=>MR STECKLER - would you excuse us for one moment?
CARTER=>Well, what do you think?
MIK=>I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
CARTER=>Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
MIK=>I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
MIK=>It's your pad - it's up to you
CARTER=>When do you want to move in?
STECKLER=>Oh as soon as possible - tomorrow?
STECKLER=>Just put it in my room
MIK=>No worries
CARTER=>Oh, before I forget, here is key and the tenancy agreement...
STECKLER=>I'll finish off here...
STECKLER=>I can manage -
STECKLER=>I said I can manage... I'm not weak you know...
STECKLER=>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
MIK=>Don't worry about it -
STECKLER=>Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
CARTER=>Sure...
STECKLER=>Tell me - ELLEN CARTER Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
MIK=>You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
STECKLER=>And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
STECKLER=>Why didn't you write any more?
CARTER=>I lost the touch
STECKLER=>The touch?
MIK=>Her husband left her
STECKLER=>Oh...
CARTER=>Do you take sugar?
STECKLER=>Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
MIK=>You kept that one quiet...what other skeletons have you got in the cupboard?
CARTER=>Sorry, I thought it was you What the hell is he doing?
CARTER=>What are you doing?
STECKLER=>I'm sorry?
CARTER=>What's with all the locks - and hammering
STECKLER=>It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
CARTER=>My names isn't ANGELA...
STECKLER=>Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
CARTER=>Don't worry - Is that my hammer Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
STECKLER=>I will...
CARTER=>Locks huh!
MIK=>Is it any good?
MIK=>ELLEN! I'm going now - I'll stay at DEKLAN'S tonight, I'll see you tomorrow
CARTER=>LESLIE - Are you hot?
CARTER=>LESLIE - are you out here?
STECKLER=>We'd better get back inside!
CARTER=>Thank you - I'd better get changed...
OLD WHORE=>Oooh I say, I haven't had the pleasure for a long time! Still, variety is the spice of life...
LOCAL=>Well, I just saw these two women go in - I thought I'd, you know - and I found her like that...
FORRESTER=>We've found something!
FOSTER=>Most of it was a mess of smears, but I got one clean print here...
TAYLOR=>How long before you can give me an idea?
FOSTER=>I started the check already, but without more specific physical ID - I can't narrow the field down - could be a month - that's if she is on record
TAYLOR=>Or he...
NEWS READER=>Once more, LONDON has been plunged into terror as the WHITE ANGEL strikes again. However, one fingerprint has been found, and Police have issued a statement that if the killer is on file, then they will have a positive identification within the month...
SMITH=>It's diabolical in'it, I mean it's not safe to walk the streets no more is it...
CARTER=>Anyway, HACKSAW JOE?
SMITH=>Sorry - yeah, well you see, JOE used to single out people he wanted to get rid off - and he would weaken them over a few weeks by giving them arsenic in small doses - on biscuits, in their tea and coffee - it has a kind of sweet taste
SMITH=>He never give them enough to kill them mind, just weaken them so that when he struck, they didn't put up too much of a fight - you see, JOE was only small - couldn't take anyone bigger or stronger on...well that's when he did his thing with the hacksaw . It got pretty nasty - you know.... a bit here, a bit there - we used to call him JIGSAW JOE - But the point is this, even JOE had principles - not like this scum who is roaming the streets now.
SMITH=>It wouldn't have happened twenty years ago...
CARTER=>I see, crime was decent then
SMITH=>You're damn right - I can't even let my daughter out at night now. Life is different now - it's a jungle out there - you've got to know who your friends are - protect yourself and your own - know what I mean?
CARTER=>Yes I know what you mean.
STECKLER=>JANET -
STECKLER=>Er, you might as well knock off now - I'll shut up shop
JANET=>Are you sure?
STECKLER=>Yes, go home...
SPIV=>Got a problem!?
SPIV=>Come on Grandad!
STECKLER=>My name is LESLIE - I'm a doctor and I have a surgery just around the corner - you could call a taxi...
STECKLER=>Anyone home?
STECKLER=>Were nearly there - just up the stairs....
STECKLER=>Its a nice room - spacious, you'll like it sweetie...
STECKLER=>Just a few days - ELLEN wouldn't understand yet - yes I'm sure she will...
CARTER=>You want to see me
TAYLOR=>ELLEN CARTER - Now how are you doing these days?
TAYLOR=>It's been what, three years?
CARTER=>What's this all about?
TAYLOR=>So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
TAYLOR=>Could I have a private moment with ELLEN?
DEZERAE=>No problem - I'll be outside
CARTER=>What brings the rats out of the sewers?
TAYLOR=>I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean? I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
CARTER=>You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
TAYLOR=>It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
CARTER=>At home alone - where were you?
TAYLOR=>As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
CARTER=>Get out...
TAYLOR=>You know ELLEN, I believe you - I know that you're no serial killer - something else maybe, but no serial killer. I'm assigning surveillance for your own protection - we couldn't have the once world famous novelist found with her head missing could we?
TAYLOR=>What happened to you - you used to have some class
TAYLOR=>Someone will find your husband one day - and then I'll have a body
TAYLOR=>Catch you later...
CARTER=>What have you done?
STECKLER=>I knew you did it - I just couldn't figure out what you had done with the body...
STECKLER=>I knew you had killed him - I just felt it - I'm surprised that the police didn't suspect 'foul play' - everything pointed that way...
STECKLER=>Oh, I admit it's a rather vulgar method - but I needed to fire your Imagination...
STECKLER=>The reason I knew you killed your husband - apart from the fact that he disappeared - is that you stopped writing - he must have been a bastard to you - Anyway, I'm going to give you a second chance to start anew.
STECKLER=>You had better sit down
STECKLER=>You see ELLEN, there are parts of me you haven't encountered - parts that are more important - that most people don't or won't understand.
STECKLER=>I want you and your words to make people understand - I'm commissioning a book
STECKLER=>I want people to understand the power any man can use - to take what he needs, to take what he wants - I want people to know why I do what I do - so that when I am finished, they will understand the truth of my actions. I want THE ELLEN CARTER to write the life story of LESLIE RAYMOND STECKLER
STECKLER=>I don't have much time ELLEN - They have my finger prints - they WILL catch me...
STECKLER=>I'm not going to hurt you - Your'e not my type - I need your skills - don't you see the divine perfection - you and I are both carved from the same stone - it will be the perfect partnership - your words - my story...
STECKLER=>And don't think of calling the police -
STECKLER=>That's where your husband is - It's not too far from here, but far enough. I have marked the map reference near the tree and lodged it in my family safety deposit box
STECKLER=>should anything ever happen to me - should I die, get hit by a truck - or disappear, then I have instructed the manager to turn the contents - along with an explanatory letter, over to Scotland Yard - so lets just hope nothing happens to me.
STECKLER=>Otherwise, you are free to do as you will...
STECKLER=>As long as you write my book...
STECKLER=>You have no choice ELLEN, you will write this book...
CARTER=>Fuck...Oh Fuck ...Oh fuck
DEZERAE=>OH MY GAWD!
CARTER=>I'm sorry - I didn't think
DEZERAE=>A person could get killed round here just for working late
CARTER=>I thought you were someone else
DEZERAE=>Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
CARTER=>I thought someone was following me - I - er - I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
DEZERAE=>Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
CARTER=>Sounds good - thank you
DEZERAE=>Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
LITTLE GIRL=>Hello?... GRANDAD! It's for you...
SMITH=>Thank you Darling - you go on back to your friends...
SMITH=>Hello?
CARTER=>Hello, ALAN - It's ELLEN CARTER here from CRIME SCENE - yes - I remember you said that if I needed something, I could come to you...
JOHN=>ALAN sent you - right?
JOHN=>What do you want?
CARTER=>I want a gun - - There's this guy, I think he's watching me - You know I'd just feel safer with a gun in the house - I wouldn't use it - just for show
JOHN=>Whatever you say Lady
JOHN=>This'll stop anything that moves
CARTER=>No - something smaller I think
JOHN=>Browning 9mm - holds 13 in the clip, one in the chamber - and I'll throw in two extra clips and a silencer...
CARTER=>I will need the bullets...
JOHN=>No problem - that's a good gun - got a nice action - try it...
MIK=>ELLEN! You're back - come and join us... You must be tired - LESLIE told me how you spent the whole day knocking out that hole...Funny place to put a fish tank though.
STECKLER=>I thought I would cook us a meal
CARTER=>No thank you - I already ate
MIK=>Oh come on ELLEN, they're the nicest ribs I have ever tasted
MIK=>LESLIE is a very talented cook - he says there's nothing he can't do with red meat and wine!
CARTER=>I'm sure that's true...
STECKLER=>If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
CARTER=>I think I will pass...
STECKLER=>Dessert is on it's way
MIK=>I think I misjudged him - he's really quite cute
MIK=>You ought to get the heating seen to - it's so hot
MIK=>What's wrong with you?
CARTER=>I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
MIK=>What?
CARTER=>You heard me - keep away from him
MIK=>You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
CARTER=>Yes I can...
MIK=>Huh - fuck you - who trampled on your grave
CARTER=>I'm giving you notice, I want you out.
CARTER=>I want you out now
MIK=>Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
CARTER=>I'm your landlady
MIK=>Just because I have dinner with LESLIE - I mean? What are you two fucking or something? Cause, if you are, I didn't know!
MIK=>Oh I understand
MIK=>It's the rent I'm due - take it then we are equal
MIK=>I'll be at DEKLAN'S, and I'll come over to collect my stuff in the next few days... Don't mind my stuff if some guy you fancy turns up - just leave it in the garden - I thought you were a nice girl ELLEN - Looks like I was wrong
VOICE OF SMITH=>Oh yeah, anyway - when he got them weakened with the arsenic, just sprinkled it on their food for a few days - like I said, just weakened them enough for him to GET THEM WHERE HE WANTED THEM WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE...
CARTER=>Sugar?
STECKLER=>Yes, one and a half please.
CARTER=>I will write your book...
CARTER=>But I have one demand - you will not kill whilst I write
STECKLER=>Fine - you will have to work fast - it will probably be only a few months before they identify my prints - and then it is over - I will destroy all the evidence in my safety deposit box - your secret will die with me... I'm so glad ELLEN
VOICE OF CARTER=>Your name?
STECKLER=>LESLIE STECKLER
VOICE OF CARTER=>What do you do?
STECKLER=>What do I do? What do you do?
VOICE OF CARTER=>I write - If this is going to work, you are going to have to get used to talking to the camera - opening up to it...
CARTER=>So what do you do?
STECKLER=>I'm a dentist
CARTER=>And how long have you been a dentist?
STECKLER=>Oh, about six years since I graduated
CARTER=>And how many people have you killed?
STECKLER=>I don't know
CARTER=>You don't know?
STECKLER=>No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
CARTER=>Where do you kill them...
STECKLER=>Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight. The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
STECKLER=>my car I stopped working from my car. She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
CARTER=>I don't know
STECKLER=>Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
CARTER=>Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
STECKLER=>No she didn't...
CARTER=>What did you do with her?
STECKLER=>You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them!
CARTER=>The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
STECKLER=>I don't want to talk about it
CARTER=>OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
STECKLER=>I don't know...
CARTER=>Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
STECKLER=>I don't know...
CARTER=>Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
STECKLER=>Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
CARTER=>Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
STECKLER=>Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
STECKLER=>Hello - is ANNIE in?
GRAHAM=>Are you a journalist?
STECKLER=>No - I'm an old friend of ANNIE'S - I haven't seen her for years - You must be GRAHAM? Is there something wrong?
GRAHAM=>I'm sorry - I've been hounded by the press - ANNIE died over a year ago.
GRAHAM=>Are you sure you don't want a glass?
CARTER=>No - thank you
GRAHAM=>So did you know her well? She never mentioned you to me
STECKLER=>Not really We had a bit of a crush on each other - Purely innocent I assure you - but she was fun - did she ever tell you about her nick name - SMUDGY?
GRAHAM=>SMUDGY? No...
STECKLER=>Yes, everyone used to tease her about that birth mark - you know the one she had on her...
GRAHAM=>I'm surprised you know about that - she wouldn't ever show anyone it
STECKLER=>Oh we got in a little tussle once - and that's when I saw it
STECKLER=>So if you don't mind me asking - how did it happen
GRAHAM=>Well - she was out late one night - just went down to the newsagent for some cigarettes - and she didn't come back...
GRAHAM=>Three days later some kids found her in some bushes - she had been...She had been... they said she died instantly...But I don't know how long she had to suffer before that bastard killed her...
GRAHAM=>The worst thing was I had to go down and identify her - she was so small and pale
GRAHAM=>How can any human being do that to another?
CARTER=>Bingo - the key...?
CARTER=>my god...
CARTER=>Oh come on!
CARTER=>How long have you been watching me?
STECKLER=>I have something I have to show you...
CARTER=>Tell me about your wife...
STECKLER=>My wife My wife was the only one who really deserved it. LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
CARTER=>then why did you marry her -
STECKLER=>It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
CARTER=>What didn't you like about her?
STECKLER=>I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
STECKLER=>home early and found her in bed with another man. I don't know who he was. It didn't matter. She never saw me. I sat and watched for half an hour before I knew what I had to do.
STECKLER=>I hated her for that. And I hated her for not wearing white at our wedding. I was cheated. I couldn't have what everyone else could have - all my life I have denied purity...The only time I really was at one with my wife was those precious few hours before I had to cut her up - she was accepting of everything then...
STECKLER=>I had to kill her. She was rotten. And like my MOTHER said - cut away the dead wood or it will stop you doing what you must do. The world is a better place without her. You should understand better than anyone.
STECKLER=>You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
CARTER=>I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
STECKLER=>You've killed but you're not a killer
CARTER=>That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
CARTER=>he beat me up - he abused me - and I just snapped.
STECKLER=>Tell me how it happened...
CARTER=>Why should I?
STECKLER=>Why not? Please - it would help me
CARTER=>There's not much to tell - I had just won my prize for the book - and he hated me for it. He had hated the book, he hated my success for so long - so he decided to make my life hell. There are things I can't tell you what he made me do - things I couldn't tell anyone... I wanted a divorce but he said he wouldn't - then opportunity just popped up...He was in the garage and I was in the car...I just let the clutch up - he couldn't get out of the way. I didn't really mean to kill him -just teach him a lesson - I guess if I had been thinking straighter I wouldn't have done it. I knew that if I was discovered I would go to jail - even if it was manslaughter I would do time - and any time would have been too much - I've seen what happens to people when they go to prison - and what happens to them when they get out. I wasn't going to be one of them.
CARTER=>I knew I had to get rid of the body - so I strung him up in the bath, slit his throat and drained him - covered him in salt - to avoid the rotting - and bricked him up. Everyone believed me when I told them he left the country - I
CARTER=>think they were glad he was gone. Everyone except for that damn cop. He knows. Somehow he just knows.
CARTER=>And I have never told THAT to anyone before
STECKLER=>And how did it feel to be rid of him
CARTER=>Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
STECKLER=>There is something special about this place - the green - in destruction there is creation - flesh rots to fertilise the ground for life to thrive on.
CARTER=>What?
STECKLER=>That is my wife...Nothing ever dies - it just changes. I changed my wife.
STECKLER=>I come here every so often - to pay my respects
STECKLER=>I'm weary ELLEN - of holding everything inside of me - that's why I need this book - In a few weeks it will be over - the police will have me - I will make you a lot of money and your career will be back on track -
CARTER=>For the book...
CARTER=>So tell me about your MOTHER
STECKLER=>My mother...? I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
CARTER=>Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
CARTER=>I had to - I have to see the beginning - now tell me about your MOTHER
STECKLER=>My MOTHER didn't love me - she never loved me - when I was fourteen I had a pet rabbit - and I killed it, just to see what my mother would do... She bought me a goldfish and told me to stop crying. Two days later she died in the accident
STECKLER=>You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
CARTER=>Did you?
STECKLER=>My ADOPTED MOTHER - Whose house was so cold I could see my breath in front of my face, whose furniture was so valuable, no-one could sit on it, whose ornaments so rare, I couldn't have school friends round...My mother, who locked me in the attic when I was naughty, who drove her husband to the grave, who brought lovers home for weekends in the country - she was filth - Is that what you want me to say... That I pushed her off the boat when she drowned, who wouldn't throw her a life buoy? Is that what you want me to say? Is IT?
STECKLER=>No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
CARTER=>STEPHANIE?
STECKLER=>My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
CARTER=>Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
STECKLER=>STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
CARTER=>What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
STECKLER=>It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
STECKLER=>I want it to stop - it all to stop...
CARTER=>Then make it stop...
STECKLER=>I need to talk to you...
CARTER=>What?
STECKLER=>I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
CARTER=>Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
STECKLER=>Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
STECKLER=>What's wrong?
CARTER=>Nothing could be better...
STECKLER=>I really must cut down on sugar - it'll be the death of me...
MIK=>Is DR. STECKLER here?
STECKLER=>I thought it was you - how are you?
MIK=>I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
STECKLER=>Yes, come on in...
MIK=>No, I can't I've got a million things to deliver. I just wanted to say thank you for the other night - I know it all got a little out of hand...
MIK=>Anyway - look, I have moved in with DEKLAN now - it's a nice flat in a shitty area - but hey, Its home!
STECKLER=>That's good
MIK=>I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
STECKLER=>Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
MIK=>Good - I've got to dash - Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
STECKLER=>Yes - of course.
TAYLOR=>Dr STECKLER?
STECKLER=>Yes...?
TAYLOR=>INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
JANET=>I'll be outside.
STECKLER=>How can I help SCOTLAND YARD then?
STECKLER=>I believe you live with a MRS ELLEN CARTER...
STECKLER=>MRS? I thought her husband was dead
TAYLOR=>Dead?
STECKLER=>Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
TAYLOR=>So she didn't mention anything more about it?
STECKLER=>No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
TAYLOR=>Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
STECKLER=>I'll be sure to...
TAYLOR=>Listen - whilst I'm here, I've been having some problems with my back teeth - you couldn't just take a look, see if I need anything doing?
STECKLER=>I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
TAYLOR=>Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
STECKLER=>OK - just hop up...
STECKLER=>Now open wide...
STECKLER=>Mmm yes - there is a cavity here... Just tell me if this hurts...
TAYLOR=>Bloody hell! Now I remember why I didn't want to go to the dentist...
STECKLER=>You really should have that filled...
TAYLOR=>Thanks for your time - DR STECKLER...
STREET PUNK=>You got a prob...?
STECKLER=>I'm a doctor - my surgery is just around the corner
STECKLER=>I'll just turn off the ALARM
MARY=>Hello?!
MARY=>Hello?!
STECKLER=>Sorry about that - lets get you up here...
MARY=>I don't know how to thank you - I think he was going to rape or kill me
STECKLER=>If I were you, I'd stick to daylight and wide open spaces from now on - lets get this off.
STECKLER=>It's not bad - it looks a lot worse than it is... You probably won't need stitches
MARY=>Is that it? Some war wound that turned out to be
STECKLER=>This will stop it making too much of a mess
MARY=>I'm terribly sorry...
STECKLER=>Don't mention it...
STECKLER=>I'll call a taxi and make some tea while you wait.
MARY=>Thank you - but don't you want a cup?
STECKLER=>No, I'm not thirsty thank you. I called a taxi - they are very good here - he should be here very...
MARY=>That's not too bad -
MARY=>I don't know how to thank you - you have been so kind - if only more people in the world could be more like you...
MARY=>I'm MARY STANLEY - nice to meet you
STECKLER=>LESLIE STECKLER...
STECKLER=>Turn it off - I can't handle that thing anymore
CARTER=>What's wrong?
STECKLER=>I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
STECKLER=>You don't disappoint or let me down ELLEN. I want the woman who helped me put the past behind me by my side - if she will have me for the short time I have left.
CARTER=>What is it?
STECKLER=>Open it...
CARTER=>You want me to wear this for you?
STECKLER=>Yes...
CARTER=>You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
STECKLER=>But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
CARTER=>But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
CARTER=>You can't just flush your past down the toilet of life - you want a second chance - what about the girls you killed - did they have a second chance - No - because you killed them. And I'm good to you - I don't condescend, and don't let you down. You know why LESLIE - because you've got me by the short and curlies - I don't have a choice, either I go to jail or to the grave! In answer to your question LESLIE - No I won't have you. Never.
CARTER=>Where are you going?
STECKLER=>Out - I may be some time
CARTER=>Wait LESLIE...I...I...
CARTERS VOICE=>"...and what of those killers which stopped? there have been many documented serial killers who merely ended their reign of terror - Jack The Ripper being one of the most sensational. Others the French Hillside Slasher - took nineteen lives then mysteriously stopped. What happened to him - did he die, was he arrested and jailed for other charges, did he leave the country - or was his carnal need fulfilled - his anger discharged? Only he will ever know..."
STECKLER=>We've got nothing to talk about
CARTER=>LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
STECKLER=>I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
CARTER=>I am sorry...
CARTER=>LESLIE? Is that good enough?
STECKLER=>Yes - I suppose so...
CARTER=>It's late and I've had too much to drink. I can't think straight now - we'll talk about it in the morning...
STECKLER=>ELLEN...
STECKLER=>I have stopped - you must believe me
CARTER=>Yes - I believe I do...
CARTER=>You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
MANAGER=>CHIC MAGAZINE?
CARTER=>Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
MANAGER=>Well MISS TANDY - It's not our policy to show people round - but if you were a potential client - that would be a different matter...
CARTER=>When could I look round?
MANAGER=>Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
CARTER=>That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
MANAGER=>BRIAN...
CARTER=>But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
MANAGER=>This is our demonstration box
MANAGER=>And these are the keys - one for you - and one for me
MANAGER=>We insert together - and out it comes
CARTER=>And this is where the client can view their contents in private...
CARTER=>Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
MANAGER=>Yes it is...
CARTER=>Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
MANAGER=>Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
CARTER=>So there is only one key...
MANAGER=>That's right...
CARTER=>And it can't be forged?
MANAGER=>I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
MANAGER=>I could get my secretary to cover for me this afternoon - If you want to go someplace now - it would save you coming back
CARTER=>Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
MANAGER=>No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
CARTER=>All the time?
MANAGER=>No - not all the time - I mean
CARTER=>I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
TAYLOR=>Hello ELLEN - looks like your doin' some more interior decorating!
STECKLER=>Sugar?
TAYLOR=>Yes - one please.
STECKLER=>ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
CARTER=>No thanks -
STECKLER=>INSPECTOR TAYLOR has told me that you are connected with that killer - the WHITE GHOST...
TAYLOR=>ANGEL...
STECKLER=>Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
CARTER=>I know why he's here
TAYLOR=>I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
CARTER=>I think you had better leave
STECKLER=>First finish your tea...
CARTER=>He doesn't need to...
TAYLOR=>Do you think she doesn't like me
TAYLOR=>If you need me, you know where I am...
CARTER=>You like playing with fire don't you
CARTER=>Why did you let him in?
STECKLER=>What was I supposed to do?
STECKLER=>It's got sugar in - you don't mind?
CARTER=>I don't like sugar
STECKLER=>There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
CARTER=>It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
STECKLER=>Why whats wrong with the sugar -
STECKLER=>42% pentathanol, 31% crysonal and 8.5% Arsenic... This was really very crude ELLEN - I tasted it straight away - I'm very familiar with arsenic - small doses over a long period of time mount up and eventually incapacitate the victim - Why did you want to incapacitate me ELLEN?
STECKLER=>WHY!!!
CARTER=>I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
STECKLER=>CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
STECKLER=>I thought you believed me! Oh don't worry ELLEN, I poured the Ant poison down the drain - I just wanted you to know what it felt like when I found out - unpleasant isn't it?
CARTER=>I could kill you now - no-one would ever know - I would have won already - unpleasant isn't it...
STECKLER=>You couldn't do it - It's not because you can't kill - it's the not knowing - if the bank would send my package - what would you do when the police come knocking...
CARTER=>Don't be so sure...
STECKLER=>I love you ELLEN, I would never hurt you.
CARTER=>Oh - I'm sorry - I didn't realise you were...
CARTER=>LESLIE - About you and me - I've been thinking about what you said...
CARTER=>Maybe I have been fooling myself - I really don't know...
CARTER=>What do you say...
STECKLER=>whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
CARTER=>Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
STECKLER=>WAIT FOR WHAT!?
STECKLER=>WHAT DO YOU WANT!? IT'S NOT FAIR!!
CARTER=>LESLIE?! that's not the way grown adults act -
CARTER=>they understand each other - the time isn't right - tonight will be right - I have some woman things to take care of before we do anything.
CARTER=>Tonight will be the night - Now get dressed and get off to work
TELLER GIRL=>May I help you?
TELLER GIRL=>May I help you?
CARTER=>Yes, I would like to open my safety deposit box please. My name is ANGELA STECKLER, MRS...
TELLER GIRL=>One moment please.
MANAGER=>Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
CARTER=>No - I've been abroad for a long time...
MANAGER=>There have been some changes since you were last here - we now require a signature.
MANAGER=>I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
CARTER=>Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
MANAGER=>I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
CARTER=>I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
MANAGER=>No - it's someone I met recently...
MANAGER=>Could you remove your sunglasses please?
MANAGER=>Fine - could you follow me MRS STECKLER
MANAGER=>This must be one of the old keys -
CARTER=>Yes - I have had it for years.
STECKLER=>ELLEN? ELLEN, I'm home...
STECKLER=>ELLEN, are you there?
STECKLER=>ANGELA? It can't be - I killed you...
VOICE OF STECKLER=>ELLEN - Why are you trying to hurt me! Why? Have you gone mad?
CARTER=>Shut up you sick fuck!
STECKLER=>I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
CARTER=>You killed my friend!
STECKLER=>Please ELLEN - put the gun down...
CARTER=>COME ON!!!
STECKLER=>I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
CARTER=>It's what you would do to me
STECKLER=>Pain is an illusion...
STECKLER=>I had a look while you were asleep I think that I am going to have to have two root canals done...
CARTER=>Don't you want me now LESLIE
STECKLER=>No - I'll have you after
STECKLER=>Open wide...
STECKLER=>This one is used for cutting through tooth and bone...
STECKLER=>I always wanted to do it this way...
MIK=>These are for LESLIE...
MIK=>What happened?
CARTER=>I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
MIK=>Is LESLIE here?
CARTER=>No he had to - he's just - he's out...
MIK=>He saved my life you know - has he told you...
MIK=>I cut myself with our electric knife - and if LESLIE hadn't been there, I would have probably bled to death - he stopped the bleeding and got me to the hospital - the doctor said ten minutes later and I would have been a stiff
MIK=>I'd appreciate it if he got the flowers - you know - to make matters worse, some bastard broke into our flat the other day - the police came round to fingerprint it - they said if they're on record - they'll catch them...
VOICE OF NEWSREADER=>POLICE have announced that a woman, as yet unidentified, is helping them with their inquiries into the WHITE ANGEL killings - The woman was apprehended after her finger print was discovered on a hammer, which belonged to her - the same hammer that was used to beat JANE MACDONALD to death last month. A brief search of the area produced more mutilated bodies, in the garden and bricked up in the walls of the house... The news has been met with....
