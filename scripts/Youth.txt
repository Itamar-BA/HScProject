CALM VOICE=>You can’t smoke here.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD=>And may I ask how your holiday is going?
FIFTY-YEAR OLD=>Why Switzerland, Maestro?
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY=>If I may, Maestro, why exactly do you find the monarchy endearing?
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY=>Her Majesty will be delighted to learn you have accepted.
FIFTY-YEAR OLD EMISSARY=>Well then, tell me which soprano would do, and you shall have her.
SECOND ASSISTANT=>Good god, it really is him.
FRED BALLINGER=>Because levity is also a perversion. What are you doing in Europe?
FRED BALLINGER=>Is it coming along well?
7A/1=>The day begins at this enormous compound, which is at once a hotel, a spa, a medical center, a sports complex, and a physical rehab facility. With established rhythms and well- defined schedules.
7A/2 7A/3=>Nurses and masseuses, all in uniform, emerge from sterile changing rooms and head to their work stations.
7A/4=>Doctors don white coats.
7A/5 7A/6 7A/7=>The guests, most of them elderly, and all of them wearing identical hotel bathrobes, form orderly lines and head to their check-ups, or to the swimming pools, saunas, and massage rooms.
7A/8=>The waiters, backlit, clear tables in the breakfast room.
7A/9=>An anorexic cook heads out behind the kitchen. Enjoying the first drag on his cigarette, he stares at the clear blue sky above the mountains.
SCREENWRITER IN LOVE=>You’ve been watching too many movies, you idiot, you’ve forgotten what life’s about!
SHY SCREENWRITER=>I've never had a girlfriend, and I also have serious doubts about my sexual orientation.
MICK BOYLE=>What do you need Bandaids for?
FRED BALLINGER=>Not from you, obviously.
FRED BALLINGER=>May I do something while you play?
FRED BALLINGER=>Including your losses these past few days, we’re up to 250 Swiss francs that you owe me.
FRED BALLINGER=>What are you doing here?
FRED BALLINGER=>Well, aren’t you going to answer me?
INTELLECTUAL SCREENWRITER=>Take notes. We can use this in the film.
FRED BALLINGER=>Worse. She’s a pop star.
21A/1=>Those two gloomy notes hover in the steam of the Turkish baths and saunas, where backlit, naked bodies of all ages look lifeless, abandoned to the heat and sweat.
21A/2 21A/3=>And then, more bodies, eyes closed, buried in tubs, wrapped in herbs and mud. Like living meadows.
FRED BALLINGER=>How’s the work on your character going?
FRED BALLINGER=>Enough! Stop singing, now! Enough!
FRED BALLINGER=>Let’s not go rushing to conclusions, Mick.
31A/1=>In close-up, the bells in the corridors trill merrily.
31A/2=>On the bridge where the staff goes to smoke, they all put out their cigarettes and, like a flock of sheep, head back inside the hotel to work.
MICK BOYLE=>And this is what you see when you’re old. Everything seems really far away. That’s the past.
MUD MAN=>We’re not even in the same universe, capisc? Now listen good: don’t you go stressing me during my relaxing vacation, cuz the last guy who did that never managed to relax again... Ciao. I'll send you a WhatsApp tomorrow.
JIMMY TREE=>What would she steal?
FRED BALLINGER=>I have nothing to say, and what’s more, I'm not interested.
MICK BOYLE=>And you're an idiot.
MISS UNIVERSE=>I never miss a robot movie, but that one’s my favorite.
JIMMY TREE=>Brava, Miss Universe!
JIMMY TREE=>So what do you miss?

BOY=>Mr. Ballinger.
LENA=>Sir, sir! Wake up, fuck!
SCREENWRITER IN LOVE=>She goes where the wind blows.
INTELLECTUAL SCREENWRITER=>Most men aren’t great artists like you.
