SNOTLOUT=>AGGHH! Hot-hot-hot!
VIKINGS=>Mind your heads!
GRISELDA THE GREVIOUS=>You can thank the young chief of Berk for that.
HICCUP=>Those are scary.
HICCUP=>Uh uh. All of us.
FISHLEGS=>What do you think?
HICCUP=>Uh, no, actually.
GRIMMEL=>It would be the undoing of civilization as... we... know... it. Hmmm...
HICCUP=>Astrid, look out!
SNOTLOUT=>Get outta my house!
HICCUP=>Alright. Fire when ready!
ACK=>To the chief!
SNOTLOUT=>Go, go, go, go, go!
VALKA=>Gotcha. Go, Cloudjumper!
RUFFNUT=>My braids are like little Zipplebacks, see? Rawr rawr! Even the mold spots look like eyes. So cute. They even have little horns and everything, just like Barf and Belch, except me and Barf can’t stand Belch, so they’re really just Barfs. It’s warm in here.
GRISELDA THE GREVIOUS=>Can’t we just feed her to your dragons?
RUFFNUT=>Stress is not good for you.
STOICK=>Yeah. Come here.
ASTRID=>-- Wait, hold on.
SOLDIER=>Watch yourselves!
GOBBER=>See that there?
