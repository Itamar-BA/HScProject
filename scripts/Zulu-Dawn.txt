BARTLE FRERE=>Reading aloud the letter he has just written.
BARTLE FRERE=>He continues to read aloud:
CHELMSFORD,=>however, continues to read, turning the page.
BARTLE FRERE=>You '11 see from the letter that this ultimatum is our decision alone. Her Majesty's government seems to prefer a negotiated settlement
BARTLE FRERE=>Does this do what we both know to be right Frederick?
CHELMSFORD=>It does Sir Henry excellently.
WILLIAMS)=>stalks behind MELVILL.
PTE. WILLIAMS=>I'm to tell you Corporal, that I love you more than my Colour Sergeant
NCO=>That's frightening... Get out of my bloody sight lad. And put your rifle over your head and double round this field until you drop bloody dead. Now move, get on with it, at the double.
NCO=>Shut up! Get back in the ranks you shower of animals.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Facing the ranks: Company Shoulder arms.... Present arms.
ELDERLY BOER=>We 've come to fight the Zulu.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>We aren't at war yet Referring to the boy: Bit young 'in' he?
ELDERLY BOER=>He's my nephew... he can shoot, track and speak Zulu and fight like hell... he's got Assegai marks to prove it...
SGT. WILLIAMS=>BOY-PULLEN
BOY-PULLEN=>. Colour Sergeant Addressing the BOERS: This way.
SOT. MA3OR=>KAMBULA pull up as the troop ride by.
NCO=>Company.... 'Shun! . Move yourselves.
S.M. KAMBULA=>Shall I give the order Sir?
COL. DURNFORD=>Alright, Sergeant
S.M. KAMBULA=>Sikali Horse Forward!
CHELMSFORD=>Splendid horsemanship Who are they?
DURNFORD=>Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
CHELMSFORD=>They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
CHELMSFORD=>Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
DURNFORD=>I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
CREALOCK=>Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
CHELMSFORD=>But will they make good use of them?
CHELMSFORD=>There's no doubting their horsemanship Colonel Durnford.
DURNFORD=>Mr. Crealock.
CHELMSFORD=>We must think how to make best use of Colonel Durnford's African knowledge.
VEREKER=>Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
DURNFORD=>Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Shouting across the field: Private Williams. You've stopped.
DURNFORD=>Mr. Raw. Take Mr. Vereker to the Store and see he '5 issued the necessary equipment And then show him to the Mess and explain to him how an Officer is expected to behave.
LT. HARFORD=>sits with his tins around him classifying his specimens.
MELVILL=>Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
COGHILL=>Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
MELVILL=>Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
PULLEINE=>He continues writing without looking up: Now, now Mr. Melvill, less of your spleen.
RAW=>Addressing the Mess: Stranger in the Mess. Gentlemen. My LorJ
RAW=>To VEREKER: Announce yourself
VEREKER=>Good day Frederick.
CHELMSFORD=>Good day William. . Pleased you could join us.
VEREKER=>It was either that, or join the Zulu.
CHELMSFORD=>. Join the Zulu? Oh yes, you're right in the thick of it aren't you? Talked to your father before we sailed.. he said you 'd taken to farming near Zulu land. Sent his regards.. Should I meet up with you. VEREKER That was nice of the old boy.
CHELMSFORD=>I think you 'd better call out who you are.
VEREKER=>William Vereker.
MURPHY=>Sir?
RAW=>Bring drinks for the stranger. Allow me to introduce the Mess: Colonel Pulleine. Messers. Melvill, Coghill...
COGHILL=>Morning.
RAW=>Jackson, Milne, Major Russel4 Stevenson,.
STEVENSON=>How do you do?
RAW=>Haiford. . and Haiford's best frienJ
RUSSELL=>Don 't leave your gin around, Vereker, or Harford will have it full of preserved butteifties. A damned waste, if you ask me.
VEREKER=>Oh I doubt if I'll leave much of that around. There's quite a shortage where I've been.
COGHILL=>Puffing on his cigar: Theyfight with spears don 't they? I mean it doesn't seem quite fair against the Martini Henry.
MELVILL=>You didn't really have to chose between your country and the Zulu did you?
VEREKER=>Um. And a damn close thing it was too.
RAW=>Taking the freshly filled trophy from MURPHY. Ah, well done Murphy. .
HARFORD=>Stranger's Cup. Down it in one and we where share your Mess bill for a week.
VEREKER=>And {fI don't?
RAW=>Then a bottle of good claret to each member of the Mess is charged to your account
MELVILL=>if it's too much we can have the bill forwarded to your father... in the
VEREKER=>No offence taken, Melvill. . To men who aren 't afraid to speak their minds.
RAW=>Good luck, Sir
RAW=>Standing, he raises his glass to propose a toast: The Regiment
OFFICERS=>The Regiment
VEREKER=>Still smiling, he wipes the remaining wine from the corners of his moustache. The Regiment.
INDUNAS=>. They surround two young Zulu warriors who are tautly circling. Their shields are held at the defensive, their assegais poised for underhand thrust.
MANTSHONGA=>I bring greetings from your friends, the British, and from the Great Lord ChelmsforJ
CETSHWAYO=>Still watching the fighting Zulus; And what do your Masters say?
MANTSHONGA=>They are angry and send these demands. They say you rule in old ways that are wrong, that you kill your people without triaL The Great White Queen herself cannot kill her lowliest subject though she rules forty lands, each greater than all ofZululanJ
BAYELE=>Kill the Traitor, Father'
CETSHWAYO=>Gesturing to his son to calm down: I do kill, under the customs of the Zulu, and I shall not depart from that Do I go to the country of the white man and tell him to change his laws and customs?
MANTSHONGA=>The British say your armies grow larger and they demand that you disband your lmpis of War
CETSHWAYO=>Tell the British I will not cross the river which divides our lands. But ask Lord Chelmsford if he would disarm his warriors in the face of such threats.
MANTSHONGA=>I will ask him but his answer will be to start war against your 30,000 warriors.
CETSHWAYO=>My armies will defend this land
FANNY=>Anthony ... Anthony
VEREKER=>Joseph, how are all the Colenso girls?
JOSEPH=>They are all in the garden, Sir And they will be glad to see you, I'm sure.
FANNY=>I did not William. You cheat, you.
VEREKER=>Me cheat? Same old Fanny. .
FANNY=>With genuine affection: Welcome. Welcome back.
DURNFORD=>Excuse me, Ladies. Leaving them, he makes towards FANNY &
VEREKER.=>54. FANNY Did you get your farm going?
VEREKER=>FANNY
FANNY=>Stopping, FANNY addresses him earnestly: I'm sorry you had to leave.
DURNFORD=>You 've met the... Honourable William Vereker, I believe.
FANNY=>Yes Anthony, we were childhood friends.
DURNFORD=>Your childhood friend shot a dead cow at the gallop the other day. . He wasn 't impressed.
CHELMSFORD=>There is a Mrs. Dumford, is there?
BARTLE FRERE=>She exists.. .but er. . .nothing '5 been heard of her, the eight years Durnford's been in Africa.
CREALOCK=>Although much is spoken of her now, My Lord.
BARTLE FRERE=>I, er, recommended him to you.. .because he knows Africa so well.
CREALOCK=>Oh indeed. His ability to recruit native contingents is proving invaluable to His Lordship.
BARTLE FRERE=>How do you rate him as a soldier?
CREALOCK=>It is widely held that he has great courage and he's an excellent engineer
BARTLE FRERE=>. Shall we join the guests?
COGHILL=>Do you think she might be interested in someone?
MELVILL=>Which one?
COGHILL=>Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
MELVILL=>ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
MRS. DEWITT=>Ah, General. . Do you find our Border Country congenial, My Lord?
CHELMSFORD=>The intention of the Zulu Impis and their King concern me deeply, Ma 'am.
FANNY=>Cetshwayo has no intention of attacking Natal, Mrs. Pretorious. Unless he '5 given no option. He has no quarrel with us. .
MR. PRETORIOUS=>You are talking of a violent and murdering barbarian who commands an army of 30,000 warriors just across the river
FANNY=>My father has known and lived with the Zulus for many years.
MR. PRETORIOUS=>Cetshwayo massacred 20,000 of his own people to make himseifKing.
COLENSO=>The English Tudor Kings did no less. Much later in our nation '5 history, I might add, and the French much more recently.
CHELMSFORD=>That may well be, Your Grace, but be that as it may, my duty is clear The defence of all this NataL
COLENSO=>Yes, well, it's difficult to stand against that position. if you speak only of . .. defence.
MR. PRETORIOUS=>And what does our good Colonel Durnford think?
CHELMSFORD=>We do Colonel, good point.
COLENSO=>I cannot be brought to believe that Cetshwayo wants a war with Britain.
BARTLE FRERE=>Every Zulu is raised to be a warrior Without a war there 'd be no Zulu nation.
MRS. DEWITT=>Nobody is really safe, are they Your Excellency?
LADY FRERE=>Mrs. Dewitt has four daughters, Henry, and Ifear she feels for them alL
VEREKER=>Your daughters may indeed be in some danger Mrs. Dewitt, but not at the moment from the Zulus, Ifear 60. The parties' attention is drawn to the four on the lawn. 61. CLOSE UP of MRS. DEWITT as she laughs politely.
BARTLE FRERE=>Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
BARTLE FRERE=>on his non compliance with the ultimatum made on him urging reformation...
BARTLE FRERE=>and redress for violations of British Sovereignty.
FANNY=>why? Why do men think ofnothing but killing? .
OFFICER=>There goes Number Two Company.
BLOOMFIELD=>Do I believe what me eyes see? The whole bleedin' Army movin' off to meet the murderin' heathen and what goes on in 'ere? A game ofBrag. Brag?
BLOOMFIELD=>You'll be more sorrier still when the Zulu ask Lad.. "What 'ave you got to offer me not to slit your gut?" and you say ah, the Knave of Hearts, Sir, the Knave of Hearts.
CHELMSFORD=>For a savage as to a child, chastisement is sometimes a kindness.
BARTLE FRERE=>Let us hope then, that this will be the final solution to the Zulu problem.
SOLDIER=>'Ere! Come back 'ere you thievin' little beggar~
DURNFORD=>approaches from behind on horseback.
CHELMSFORD=>Excellent. Thank you. Give them to Crealock, would you?
DURNFORD=>My Lord. This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
CHELMSFORD=>Gentlemen, within ten days we shall cross the Buffalo River and British soldiers will then be in Zululand. Colonel Durnford will remain down river
CHELMSFORD=>where he will be responsible for the defence of the Natal border Turning his horse and without looking at DURNFORD he leads his Party off
BOY-PULLEN=>Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
BLOOMFIELD=>I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
BOY-PULLEN=>From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
BLOOMFIELD=>So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
BOY-PULLEN=>Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
BLOOMFIELD=>Could be. Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
BOY-PULLEN=>You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
BLOOMFIELD=>One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
DURNFORD=>Your orders, Mr Vereker?
VEREKER=>I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
DURNFORD=>Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
VEREKER=>I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Out! Not the ox's arse, you bloody idiod
PTE. WILLIAMS=>Serg' ah, I'm drowning Sergeant. .
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Williams, what the bloody 'ell do you mean by 'aving the sante name as me?
PTE. WILLIAMS=>Sorry Serg' .
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>Do you think Cetshwayo will send a party to greet you, Mr Vereker?
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>You mean you've seen them?
VEREKER=>Forward Sikali!
CHELMSFORD=>What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
CREALOCK=>Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
CHELMSFORD=>Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
NCO=>Come on lads, it's only a river! .
NCO=>I'll 'ave your guts fer garters!
CHELMSFORD=>An historical moment, Gentlemen.
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>Excuse me, My Lord. Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
CHELMSFORD=>1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
CHELMSFORD=>Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
CHELMSFORD=>Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
CHELMSFORD=>Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
CHELMSFORD=>My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
VEREKER=>with the SIKALI HORSE.
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>I have it, My Lord, we attack for sport - or is it reputations?
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>I know your views on the usefulness of the Press, My Lord, but the Englishman back home wants to know what his Regiments are doing.
BLOOMFIELD=>Look at that waste. Five rounds ruined Mr HaiforJ Each round has to be accounted for.
LT. HARFORD=>I'm talking about our drowned Natives, Quartermaster!
BLOOMFIELD=>Natives is not on my invoices, Mr Haiford. . ammunition is, and 'as to be accounted for. and the brass cartridge cases returned. 111. In disgust, LT. HARFORD turns his horse about. He meets
HAMILTON-=>BROWN at the top of the bank.
LT. HARFORD=>Several of our Natives went under Shouldn 't we have a Rolicall Colonel?
HAMILTON-BROWN=>Not practical, lad.. .we haven 't had time to make up the rolls yet Besides, I'm not sure how many we had before the crossing.
MELVILL=>May Ianswer, Sir?
CHELMSFORD=>By all means, Mr. Melvill.
MELVILL=>Company, advance!
CHELMSFORD=>Major, send the troops.
CHELMSFORD=>Welt, Gentlemen, first blood to us and a rousing good report in the newspapers to satisjy the politicians, eh?
CETSHWAYO=>My warriors, our people are hungry. We must gather the crops that will feed us through the Winter But first we must defend our lands... from those who would steal the fruits of our labours. The British have broken their promise.. and crossed the Buffalo River into our home- lands. We must fight to survive.
CETSHWAYO=>We must kill!
ALL ZULUS=>Usutu... Usutu... Usutu..
CREALOCK=>& PULLEINE are close by.
CHELMSFORD=>Your destination, Colonel?
PULLEINE=>Um Isil'...
MELVILL=>I want your wagons in an extended line, Quartermaster, but not too extended, or my Company can 'tprotect them. No more than fifty feet between each one.
BLOOMFIELD=>Sir~
BLOOMFIELD=>Come on lads, keep them wagons moving. No more than fifty feet Keep 'em moving. Keep 'em moving.
UHAMA=>Follow the white Man, let him see you. He will lead you to the soldiers. Then, let the white Soldiers take you. When they think they have broken you tell them that the Impis are in the East
FANNIN,=>VEREKER gives the signal to advance.
FANNIN=>Zulu Zulu!
FANNIN=>I'm ill.. dozens of Zulus followed me. I must have shot five, six, ten, I lost count. They just kept coming. Blood curdling swine.
VEREKER=>Why did they attack you?
FANNIN=>I discovered their Army, Your Honour a valley full of them and beyondt
VEREKER=>Army? what Army?
FANNIN=>Beyond them hills, Sir and coming this way.
ST=>154. THE CAMP AT ISANDHLWANA. 21 JANUARY. 6.OOPM
PULLEINE=>Officer Vereker, er, would you mind me asking you to take a look at this map?
PULLEINE=>You see
PULLEINE=>What about my wagons?
ELDERLY BOER=>On an open slope like this, you must bring your wagons round and form them into a laager and do it immediately
CHELMSFORD=>dismounts and addresses PULLEINE.
CHELMSFORD=>I hear you have prisoners, Colonel, well done. Good evening, William.
PULLEINE=>Thank you, Sir
VEREKER=>Good evening, Frederick. I think you should hear this. You were saying your brother didn 't laager his camp right?
ELDERLY BOER=>They had seventy-three in their party. We found seventy-three skeletons six months later
CHELMSFORD=>You're leaving us Master Boer?
ELDERLY BOER=>I'm going to camp among the rocks over there.
CHELMSFORD=>Unlikely most unlikely. It would mean taking 24,000 men over mountain tops. This is not helpfuL Have the prisoners brought to my camp.
CORPORAL=>No sir, no.
VEREKER=>Be sensible man, tell us.
VEREKER=>passes RUSSELL busy oiling the elevating mechanisms on his rocket tubes.
PULLEINE=>What did they say?
VEREKER=>Claim they're deserters from the main Impis in the East. Followed this way so they could give themselves up, go home.
PULLEINE=>Do you believe that?
VEREKER=>Oh their bodies are well oiled. They 're fed regularly, but it's unlikely they're the fugitives they say.
CHELMSFORD=>Have them questioned further
FANNIN=>Wherever they are, Your Worship, there are sixty thousand or more
CHELMSFORD=>They multiply, Mr Fannin. You do speak the Zulu tongue, do you?
CHELMSFORD=>And tomorrow I intend to find the Zulu Impis, Mr Fannin, and you will accompany me.
FANNIN=>Er, I'm no soldier, Your Honour, and it 's further into Zululand.
CHELMSFORD=>You will accompany me, Mr Fannin, or you will be arrested.
PULLEINE=>This way, Mr Fannin.
CHELMSFORD=>Crealock We have scouts out in the direction he claims he saw the Zulus? CREALOCK
CHELMSFORD=>Of course, Sir. And?
CREALOCK=>The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
CHELMSFORD=>Thank you.
BOY-PULLEN=>Why don 't the Zulus attack?
BLOOMFIELD=>Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us and wait and find our weaknesses.
BOY-PULLEN=>Have we weaknesses, Quartermaster?
PTE. WILLIAMS=>What was that, Storey?
PTE. WILLIAMS=>Well I did. Stand To. .
PTE.=>Stand To, Colour Sergeant.
PTE.=>SGT. WILLIAMS I've gotta see this.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Did you call 'Stand To', Private Williams?
STOREY=>I didn 't hear nothing, Serg'.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>No. You've done well fer once. Don 'tpush yer luck!
PTE. WILLIAMS=>You never would, Colour Sergeant A medal?
DURNFORD=>Colonel Durnford here.
SGT.=>WILLIAMS salutes.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Just follow the track, Sir, you '11 come to Lord Chelmsford '5 Head Quarters.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Get down, lads.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>You done welL Keep it up laJ Keep it up.
CHELMSFORD=>You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
DURNFORD=>I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
CHELMSFORD=>Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
CHELMSFORD=>Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
DURNFORD=>I'm explaining my reasons.
CHELMSFORD=>Yes?
CREALOCK=>A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
CHELMSFORD=>Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
DURNFORD=>And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists?
CREALOCK=>Perhaps he has thought to conquer Zululand on his own, My LorJ
CHELMSFORD CHELMSFORD=>I trust you to keep me well informed of Colonel Durnford and his men when they arrive William.
VEREKER=>Certainly Frederick.
CHELMSFORD=>Gentlemen, we move to find camp and engage the enemy, and my nose tells me that we may make early contacfl
PULLEINE=>Mr Melvill, until the reinforcement arrives we will Stand To.
MELVILL=>Sir You there. Sound "Fall In".
COGHILL=>Sir
PULLEINE=>Oh, Mr Melvill, kindly send a lookout Tell him to call out the instant he spies Colonel Durnford's Column coming to reinforce us.
COGHILL=>Stuart?
STUART SMITH=>Yes.
COGHILL=>How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
STUART SMITH=>Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
COGHILL=>Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
STUART SMITH=>Right. Bombardier, to me please.
CHELMSFORD=>What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
NORRIS-NEWMAN=>Eleven o'clock, My LorJ
CHELMSFORD=>Our friend Colonel Dumford will be should be at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
CREALOCK=>Sir
SENTRY=>I'llfix 'im, Serg'
SENTRY=>Shut that yellin' up, you 'ear me! Did you 'ear me? Shut up!
PULLEINE=>Exceedingly pleased to greet you, Sir
DURNFORD=>ColoneL I see you're 'Standing To.' Perhaps the men could eat with their equipment unbuckled.
PULLEINE=>Oh yes, of course. Excellent idea, good. Oh, Mr Melvill, order "Stand Down", will you?
MELVILL=>Sir~
PULLEINE=>Please.
MELVILL=>Sergeant Stand the men down would you.
NOGGS=>Crealock, old fellah . I'm doing notes for my dispatch and I need to clear up afew military points. I don 't want to bother His Lordship. Had it drummed into my thick skull that a good Commander never willingly splits his forces, especially in an enemy's country before knowing their dispositions.
CREALOCK=>Ah, Yes, if we were facing a European enemy armed with guns I think your point would hold, Noggs. Further, may I remind you I do not create the strategies you wish to comment on. I am only his Lordship's Secretary. .
NOGGS=>With a slight chuckle he leans closer to CREALOCK. I wouldn 't take overly comfort from that Crealock old fellah because if~he sinks, then you sink with him.
VEREKER=>Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties.
DURNFORD=>And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
VEREKER=>So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
PULLEINE=>His Lordship is of the certain opinion that it 's far too difficult an approach to be chosen by the Zulu command.
VEREKER=>We don 't know.
DURNFORD' S=>instruction. DURNFORD returns to his meal.
ZULUS=>try to flee but in vain. One soldier, TROOPER JAMES, aims his rifle at one of the ZULUS and fires. VEREKER, hearing the shot, rides towards TROOPER JAMES, but stops when he gets to the ZULU BOY who is lying motionless on the ground. Dismounting, VEREKER goes over to the body and looks down at the dead boy with compassion.
VEREKER=>Sikali, forward!
VEREKER=>Fire!
VEREKER=>Retire! Rerire!
STOREY=>Oy! Goon. What'redoin'?
MELVILL=>Don 't tell me the Zulu managed to get up there after alt
RAW=>Zulu!
RAW=>They're here.
RAW=>I've sent to Lord Chelmsforct PULLEINE

BOY SOLDIER=>follows him.
STOREY=>Ninety two, ninety three, ninety four, ninety five, ninety six, ninety seven, nighty eight, ninety nine What's next, boy?
STOREY=>Oy. You useless little bastard. Come 'ere. Scamper.
CHELMSFORD=>Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
CREALOCK=>Certainly, Sin
HAMILTON-BROWN,=>HARFORD & MILNE. NOGGS is also present. As CHELMSFORD sits, so do the others.
CHELMSFORD=>After lunch, Brown, I want you to return to Isandhlwana and instruct Colonel Pulleine to join us here immediately.
CHELMSFORD=>No appetite, Colonel? .
HAMILTON-BROWN=>My men haven 't eaten since yesterday and there won 't be any supplies until I get them back to Isandhlwana.
CHELMSFORD=>Well they can start off now and you can join them when you've eaten.
HAMILTON-BROWN=>Kind of you, My Lord. But I don't think it would be proper for me to sit at your table while they're with their bellies stuck to their backbones.
EXITS.=>HARFORD Excuse me, Sir.
CHELMSFORD=>Learn nothing from that Irishman, HafforJ behave.
HARFORD=>Yes, Sir.
CREALOCK=>A strange message from Vereker, My Lord. It would seem Pulleine has a battle on his hands. No details. No intelligence.
CHELMSFORD=>Mr. Milne. Kindly take your telescope to a high point Note the events at Isandhlwana.
MILNE=>Sir. .
SGT.=>WLLIAMS for reassurance.
SGT.=>Yes, Sir.
DURNFORD=>Ride to Lord Chelmsford. Ride toward Ulundi. Tell him the battle he longs for has started and he needs to move here quickly. Quickly.
STOREY=>All right, this '11 do. Here, grab that.
BOY SOLDIER=>Master.
STOREY=>Somebody's not watching our bloody markers. Come on, Sunshine.
STOREY=>Oh no. Come all this bloody way to get shot by a bullet from Birmingham. Shoot straight, you bastards! STOREY takes the boy's hat and runs quickly forward as the ZULUS advance over the inert body.
RUSSELL=>Fire one. Fire two.
PULLEINE=>Reinforcement only. And ride to Stuart Smith. Let his guns cover Durnford for a fall back.
VEREKER=>Yes Sir. Sikali, follow me.
VEREKER=>You give me some covering fire for Dumford on the right flank.
STUART SMITH=>Sir. Whole section RIGHT'
STUART SMITH=>Fire!
DURNFORD=>Fire! Retreat!
DURNFORD=>rides to make sure that firing against the rear line of ZULUS is maintained to prevent it too from coming forward, to secure the temporary breech.
COGHILL=>Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers.
MELVILL=>Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
STOREY=>I'm running out of bleedin' ammunition. Buglen'
BUGLER=>What?
STOREY=>More ammunition. Scamper!
BUGLER=>I've bin twice already.
STOREY=>You can go three times. It won 't do you any 'arm. Go on! Run both ways.
STOREY'S MATE=>But bullets run out.. and those bloody spears don 't
BLOOMFIELD=>Pullen! You will not issue ammuntion from this wagon to any but authorised Companies. This lot can have their own. .
BLOOMFIELD=>Get to your own wagon.
BLOOMFIELD=>Get back in line, boy. Wait your turn.
BUGLER=>But Sir
BLOOMFIELD=>Move. BLOOMFIELD returns to prizing open the boxes. BUGLER goes to return to the end of the queue but turns back to plead with BOY-PULLEN.
BUGLER=>Pullen?
BOY-PULLEN=>Look it am 't my fault. All the tops are screwed down.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Present, Arms.
STOREY=>Hurry up with that bloody amo
MILNE=>My Lord, I watched the camp for twenty minutes. The haze obscures much. The tents have not been stuck. The only thing I could distinguish is the wagons have been moved on mass into the camp.
CHELMSFORD=>Thank you Mr. Milne. Inform Colonel Crealock, would you?
MILNE=>Sir.
CREALOCK=>Thank you, Milne.
CREALOCK=>Calm yourself Mr. Haiford. Where do you come by this intelligence?
HARFORD=>Durnford's Cavaye himself rode from the camp.
CREALOCK=>Very well, go on.
HARFORD=>Colonel Harness has already turned with the artillery.
CREALOCK=>Mn Haiford. . control your passions. A professional soldier must keep cool and thoughtful in times of stress.
DURNFORD=>Good work, Mn Vereker.
DURNFORD=>Move the horses!
NCO=>Take the high grouncit
DURNFORD=>Speed up the ammunition flow, Vereker. I'll try to hold the road to Rorke '5 Drift.
SGT. WILLIAMS=>Fire. Fire. Close ranks. Retreat!
