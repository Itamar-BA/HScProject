HARRY=>Bay doors open.
WITHIN MOMENTS...=>BANG! Superman is rocked by a flak explosion. The sky fills with flak puffs and the plane rocks with shock waves. The CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK of holes being punched into the fuselage. Stanley gripping his machine guns, pivots his turret as the plane bucks. He can see nothing except white puffs of flak bursting close by. Louie is being bounced around, he loses the target, he tries to find it again, staying focused. Dull BOOM—the bomber on his wing breaks apart in its mid- section and falls away trailing smoke. Louie’s look follows the bomber as it falters, and disappear under Superman's wing. At last, Lou has his aim. Louie releasing bombs. Looking down through the bay as the bombs fall away. A knot of planes and structures beside a runway EXPLODE. The Superman passes over a set of red-roofed barracks and an antiaircraft battery, Lou's second and third target. He lines them up and watches the bombs crunch into the buildings and battery.
LOUIE=>There you are...
CUP=>We got no flaps. So, basically, we got no brakes.
LOUIE=>How far to base?
PRIEST’S VOICE=>. . . And God set them in the firmament of the Heaven
BULLIES=>BRUTABRUTTABAATATATA...
NICKY=>Stay down you dumb dago.
LOUIE=>This is so dumb.
LOUIE=>I don’t believe.
OR=>Louie is training hard. He runs as if his life depends on it.
RADIO ANNOUNCER ONE=>...They're calling him the Torrance Tornado. I like the sound of that!
LA TIMES REPORTER=>The “Torrance Tornado” - smoked the mile in 4:21.3 seconds, Zamperini is now officially the fastest high school runner in American history. Folks, this kid is on his way to Olympics!...
PHIL=>Still too fast.
RUNNING=>Montage: lateral, and pulling, and trailing Louie. Through beautiful countryside. Unlike the track meets we have seen heretofore, this run is completely peaceful. Sun through leaves, bird calls, the regular HUFF of the runner and CLOMP of his footfalls. Cup: looking from Louie to his odometer. Odometer: mile-tenths turning over. Louie accelerating. Cup’s foot on the accelerator—a gentle push. One last surge from Louie, faster still. He tilts his neck back, looking up. Tropical canopy. Sun strobing through the leaves. Finally: last mile-tenth turns over. The rain forest canopy ends at a high curve in the road, revealing an endless expanse of sea below. Stopwatch hit. Cup: he slows the jeep and toots the horn to signal Louie that the mile is up. Louie slows to a jog. Cup looks at the stopwatch. Louie has slowed to a panting walk. The jeep eases up to him. Cup throws the stopwatch for Louie to read. They share a smile.
PHIL=>
GUNSHOT=>A starter’s pistol, in close shot. Athletes take off running. Louie, running. We intercut a rough, hand-held pull of Louie, with an equally rough point-of-view. He is nowhere near the front of the pack.
A MINUTE LATER=>Louie, on the raft, and Mac, still in the water, negotiate Phil onto the raft. Phil himself cannot help much. Mac clambers in as Louie finds the gash in Phil’s scalp. Louie takes off his shirt, dips it in water, and presses it to the wound. Louie looks around, scanning surface. Some of the debris is starting to sink.
MAC=>We’re going to die and you damn well know it!
LOUIE=>Two or three sips a day.
MAC=>What was that?
CLOSE ON LOUIE=>Eyes popping open. It is a bald day. The whining noise is distinguishable as engine noise. Louie bolts to a sitting position, looking up. Blue sky. Far above, a moving dot. A plane.
LOUIE=>. . . Damnit! Down here!
LOUIE=>Doesn’t matter?
BLACK=>The sound of a heavy door opening. Breathing and oofs! As a body is manhandled and flung to the ground. Close on Louie: a blindfold is ripped away. He is lying on a dirt floor. He blinks, looks: His point-of-view: low looking steeply up at a Japanese guard stepping away, the blindfold dangling from one hand. He goes through the door and it is closed after him. Louie collects himself, gets on his hands and knees, and looks around the dim and very cramped space. Wooden cell. Thatched roof. No exterior window. Small, closed window in the door. Hole in the floor: latrine. Louie squints at the dirt floor by one of his planted hands: movement. He jerks his hand away. He looks closer: Wriggling maggots. He presses himself into a corner. After a beat:
TRANSLATOR=>Draw Nawdn bombsight.
THE BIRD=>New prisoners... you are not dismissed...you will stand quarantine. We cannot have disease in the barracks.
LATER-=>Louie and the POWs, are still standing in the cold. The Bird appears on his balcony, finally giving the order to the Guards to lead Louie and the new POWs to their barracks.
OMORI GUARD=>Enlisted men to work.
THE BIRD=>Who is the Olympic athlete? Louie’s hand goes up. The Bird smiles.
LOUIE=>What’s he doin?
FITZGERALD=>Then they shoot you.
FITZGERALD=>Who says you’re not?
THE BIRD=>Why do you make me hit you?
MICROPHONE=>Louie tentatively sits into frame behind the mike. A delicious fruit bowl has been placed on the table in front of him. His mouth waters. He’s almost mesmerized by it. From off we hear well-modulated Japanese speech. Louie looks. At another table, a Japanese RADIO HOST in a suit and slicked- back hair speaks into his own microphone. Something in his own speech amuses him and he interrupts himself with a chuckle, and then plows on. Louie looks around, still somewhat disoriented. The man at the other table now switches to English:
LOUIE ON RADIO V.O.=>I am now interned in a Tokyo prisoner of war camp, and am being treated as well as can be expected under wartime conditions.
MINUTES PASS-=>Louie feels the sun come across his face. He feels not the heat but the warmth. THE LIGHT. He feels his own spirit rise. He transcends. Louie’s face changes before our eyes. Still looking at The Bird, he can see through the monster. The Bird can feel it. He is taken aback. Furious. He feels exposed. Human. We remain close on Louie and The Bird through this deep exchange. All the men in the camp are watching. Close on their faces. Louie’s fight is their own. They see his strength and their spirits rise. Even Blackie begins to smile. WIDE - A space round where Louie stands in the sun, the beam above his head. The camp clock. 3:40. The Bird is no longer smiling. His black eyes riveted on Louie. LOUIE HAS BROKEN THE BIRD. Minutes later- on Louie - Eyelids drooping. Shuddering. Still, he holds up the plank. Louie’s eyes go in and out of focus. He sees: The Bird can’t take it anymore. Angry, he jumps down off the roof and charges towards him in a fury. The Bird reaches Louie, who is still holding up the beam. The Bird feels beaten.
THE BIRD=>Prisoners to barracks. Now.
A BROAD WHITE STAR.=>IT IS AN AMERICAN BOMBER. The plane’s red light is blinking a message in Morse code. Fitzgerald near Louie can read the coded message. He cries:
LOUIE=>Cara mamma mia.
