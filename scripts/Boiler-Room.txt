MANAGER=>Mr. Brantley, how are you?
MICHAEL=>Great, great.
MANAGER=>Would you prefer to go to the ballroom first, or are you going to hit the tables right off?
MICHAEL=>Let's go to the room. The boys look hungry.
RICHIE=>Holy shit, that's the jockey from Venezuela. He's a sicko. I heard he weighs like forty-eight pounds.
CHRIS=>No, 119, but you're close, slut.
RICHIE=>Whatever. Give me three to one on that skinny nigga.
GREG=>Do me a favor, Richie...
RICHIE=>You wanna throw down?
MICHAEL=>Quiet down a second. I want you all to know that those pikers at the NASD are finally off our ass. JT Marlin once again has unlimited trading authorization. I told you guys, you can't keep a good man down. We are the superstars now. JP Morgan just faxed over their congratulations. It said, "Welcome to the Club." This also means that the teams headed by Ron and Anthony who were good enough to give up their rep numbers, can stop cold calling and start trading again. Welcome back. To show you guys just how appreciative I am, I have a little something extra for you. I want all of you guys from those teams to go up to suite 418. We're players now, boys, let's celebrate it. Salute!
MARC=>Take it to 'em, Richie!!
TODD=>And take it quick, we're all waiting out here.
VOICE=>Put it in your ass!
GREG=>Morning baby. You wanna tell me where the fuck you were last night?
DEBBIE=>Not particularly. And don't call me baby. Greg, I'm not sure how better to explain this to you, but it's over.
GREG=>That what you think?
DEBBIE=>Kiss off would you, I've got work to do.
GREG=>No, I understand why you'd be concerned. You just have to calm down for a second. You see nothing's changed. Our game plan's the same. Look, this is off the record, but I spoke to the controller this morning. He assured me that they will be reporting better than expected third quarter earnings next month. Right. See I'm telling you, just sit tight, everything's fine. It's type two buying power. You're golden. Call me in a month from now when you're rich. Bye.
MARC=>Here you go, Greg.
GREG=>I hope these are better than the last batch of shit you gave me. You produce more wood than Ron Jeremy.
MARC=>What? What do you mean?
GREG=>I see you making your calls. Listen to me, you can't just get on the phone and say, 'Can I send you some information?' If you want them off the phone so bad, why don't you just hang up? You have to excite them about things. You want them to beg for a broker on that first call.
MARC=>You're right. I freeze up when...
GREG=>Just stop pussying out every time someone picks up the phone; it's what you want.
KID=>You still owe me twenty-five bucks.
KID=>I spotted you at Douglaston last week. Remember? The birdie on nine?
KID=>Mind your fucking business.
SETH=>Sorry about that.
MOTHER=>I'm just saying, this isn't good, Seth. You're late and your father's really upset with you. He won't even tell me what it is. I just wanted to warn you.
NEIL=>What's up, Seth?
SETH=>Hey bro, how's school?
MARTY=>That's a good question. You want to tell me what happened, Seth?
NEIL=>We didn't know if you were still coming.
SETH=>There was traffic.
MARTY=>So?
SETH=>Don't you want to wait till after dinner?
MOTHER=>Yeah, I think that's a better...
MARTY=>Answer the question.
SETH=>I dropped out.
MARTY=>Tell me why.
SETH=>I gave it a year Dad, it's not for me. I'm sure of it.
MARTY=>So you've been lying to our faces for six months now. Six months. Schools fine, Dad. My grades are good, Dad. Okay, let's leave that for a second. If you dropped out then you're not getting your student loan checks anymore. Right? I want to know how you're making rent every month.
SETH=>Dad, please don't ask me that.
MOTHER=>You're dealing drugs, aren't you?
SETH=>No, of course not. I'm not a drug dealer, Mom.
MOTHER=>Well, what are you doing? This is making me nervous, Seth.
SETH=>Okay. There's a business I'm running. But I'm earning my money honestly.
MARTY=>Is this what you call earning a living?
MOTHER=>What are those, Marty? Are those drugs?
SETH=>Yes, it's an honest living. Ask any of my customers.
MARTY=>Customers? What are you talking about? They're people's children from this community. How do you think I got these? Anyway, it's illegal! You're running a back- door card game! How do you think this reflects on me? I'm a judge for Christ's sake! If this ever gets out...
MARTY=>Are you listening to me?!!
SETH=>Yes.
SETH=>That's sixteen.
CASINO PATRON=>Hit me.
SETH=>And bust. I'm sorry.
CASINO PATRON=>Fuck! I cannot win a fucking hand tonight.
SETH=>Hey Steve!
STEVE=>Yeah?
SETH=>Get in here. What kind of soda you like?
CASINO PATRON=>I don't care!
SETH=>Here, take my car and go get Mike a coke and a falafel. You hungry?
CASINO PATRON=>Yeah, yeah... sure. Why not?
SETH=>Come on, Mike. It's a roller coaster, ups and downs. You know that. Alright, place your bets.
SETH=>See ya guys.
KID=>Fuck you!
ADAM=>He's not gonna let you in. He doesn't know you. The kid's not stupid, Greg.
SETH=>Who's this?
ADAM=>This is my boy Greg.
SETH=>We thought we were done for the night.
ADAM=>Is it too late to get a couple of hands in?
SETH=>Nah. Twenty-four/seven, you know that.
SETH=>Hey Steve, go grab a couple of sandwiches.
SETH=>Okay, house rules are as follows. We play Las Vegas with the exception of a particular side bet. You can bet over- under thirteen on the dealer's hand with a loss occurring on blackjack.
GREG=>That's cute, like the green spot on a roulette wheel.
GREG=>How many idiots take that bet?
SETH=>More than you'd think.
ADAM=>Alright give me... four hundred dollars.
GREG=>You didn't say anything about the betting.
SETH=>What were you thinking?
GREG=>Five hundred Max?
SETH=>We don't usually service that level of action here... but I'd hate to turn away a new customer. Thing is, we may not have enough cash here to settle you at the end of the night.
GREG=>That's okay. You can pay me tomorrow.
SETH=>Sure. How much you want?
GREG=>Five dimes.
SETH=>In what denomination?
GREG=>Denomination? Ummm, I'll take three Puerto Ricans, two Chinks and a Guinea.
GREG=>I'll let you mix it up for me.
ADAM=>You're such a prick. Gotta make me feel like I'm playing at the kiddie table.
GREG=>If the shoe fits, baby. Oh shit. You got real chips.
GREG=>Look, they even say "Seth's" on 'em. This is no joke.
ADAM=>I told you.
SETH=>At first we just used Bicycle poker chips, you know, the kind you can buy in a deli. Then some kids started sneaking in additional funds.
ADAM=>Jesus Christ. Bet you put a stop to that shit real quick.
GREG=>And you pay for food and drinks for all these kids?
SETH=>I sure as hell don't cook for them. I've already lived in four places in Queens. I don't think I ever turned a stove on except to light a cigarette.
GREG=>You and me both.
SETH=>But I take care of my customers. Smokes, food, soda. Look, I'm not stupid, I never buy decaffeinated.
GREG=>Holy shit, would you listen to this kid.
SETH=>Alright. Place your bets.
MARTY=>Hi Seth.
SETH=>Hey Dad.
MARTY=>So what's up?
SETH=>How you doing?
MARTY=>I'm fine, Seth. What's on your mind?
SETH=>I just feel bad about the way things went at the house last week. I feel like we just don't get anywhere talking at home.
MARTY=>I'm not sure what there is to talk about. You're a habitual liar. You've dropped out of school, you're running an illegal casino out of your apartment. You're putting my career at risk. What do you want to talk about?
SETH=>Why can't we just discuss this? Maybe you're not seeing my side.
MARTY=>Your side? You're doing wrong. I'm not your best friend, here to nod my head and sympathize. That's my your mother's racket. I'm your father. I let you know when you screw up. Did you think I was going to pat you on the back for this casino idea? Tell you what an entrepreneur you are?
SETH=>No.
MARTY=>So, what do you want from me? Meeting me in a coffee shop is not going to change the life you have. God, if I ever asked my father to meet me for a cup of coffee to talk about my screw-up he probably he probably would have laughed. We didn't have nice little chats about why I was a bad boy. Whether I was just calling out for attention or not. I got smacked and then I didn't do it again. Much simpler.
SETH=>Well that really worked great on me, Dad.
MARTY=>What?
SETH=>Look Dad, I'm sitting here and I'm trying to restore what's left of our relationship.
MARTY=>Relationship? What are you talking about? We're not dating, Seth. I'm your father, not your girlfriend. So stop with the pop- psychology talk. Did your mother feed you this crap?
SETH=>No.
MARTY=>Clean up your life. Make an honest living. Then we can talk like normal people. I gotta get back to work. I'm hearing a grand jury indictment this afternoon.
GREG=>I'm just saying, this is risky business. You plan on dealing cards to college kids when you're thirty-five? Think you won't get busted in the next two years? You need to start thinking about down-the-line time.
SETH=>So I should come work for you, huh? I guess it'll be retribution for me taking all your money here.
GREG=>First of all, I'm not done with your here. And no, you'll only be working for me for a short time. You learn the ropes, pass the series seven, then you're on your own. Just ask Adam, he'll tell you.
DEBBIE=>Over here.
SETH=>Have they started interviewing yet?
DEBBIE=>No.
SETH=>How long do you expect the wait to be?
DEBBIE=>You'll all be going in at the same time.
SETH=>I thought this was an interview.
DEBBIE=>It's a group interview. You'll see.
DEBBIE=>Here. Fill this out. I'd say have a seat, but that doesn't look like it's going to happen.
SETH=>That's okay.
RUDE KID=>Hey, when's this shit gettin' started?
RUDE KID=>You hear me?
DEBBIE=>I hear you. I'm just not answering.
RUDE KID=>What the fuck?
DEBBIE=>Open your mouth again and I'll personally guarantee you never get a job here.
JIM=>Alright guys, come this way.
JIM=>I'm sorry, but that's my seat.
MARC=>Oh man, I'm so sorry.
JIM=>It's alright.
RUDE KID=>Fucking dumb-ass.
JIM=>You can get the fuck out of here.
RUDE KID=>What? What?
JIM=>Don't talk to me, don't look at me, just pick your ass up out of that Italian leather chair and get the fuck out of this room.
JIM=>We expect everyone here to treat their co-workers with a certain level of respect.
JIM=>Now before I get started I have a question. Has anyone here passed the series seven?
SERIES SEVEN=>I have a series seven license.
JIM=>Good for you, now you can get out too.
SERIES SEVEN=>What? Why?
JIM=>Because we don't hire brokers. We train new ones.
JIM=>This is the deal. I am not here to waste your time and I can only hope you're not here to waste mine. So I'm gonna keep this short. You become an employee of this firm and you will make your first million within three years. Okay? Let me repeat that. You will make a million dollars within three years of your first day of employment at JT Marlin. Everybody got that? There is no question as to whether you will be a millionaire working at this firm, the question is how many times over.
JIM=>You think I'm joking. I am not joking. I am a millionaire. It's a weird thing to hear, right? I'll tell you, it's a weird thing to sa. I'm a fucking millionaire. Now guess how old I am? Twenty-seven. You know what that makes me here? A fucking senior citizen. This firm is entirely comprised of people your age, not mine. Lucky for me, I am very fucking good at my job or I'd be out of one. You guys are the new blood. You're gonna go home with the kesef. You're the future Big- Swinging-Dicks of this firm. Now you all look money hungry and that's good. Anybody who says money is the root of all evil, doesn't have it! Money can't buy happiness? Look at the fucking smile on my face. Ear to ear, baby. You wanna hear details? I drive a Ferrari 355 cabriolet. I have a ridiculous house on the South Fork. I've got every toy you can imagine. And best of all, kids, I am liquid.
JIM=>So now that you know what's possible, let me tell you what's required. You are required to work your ass off. We want winners, not pikers. A piker is someone who walks at the bell. A piker asks how much vacation time he gets in the first year. See, people work here to become filthy rich. No other reason. That's it. You want vacation time? Go teach third grade public school.
JIM=>Your first six months at the firm are as a trainee... you make one hundred and fifty dollars a week. After you're done training, you take the Series Seven test. When you pass, you become a junior broker and you'll be opening accounts for your team leader. After you open forty accounts you begin working for yourself and then... sky's the limit. Now a word about being a trainee. The other brokers, your parents, whoever: they're gonna give you shit about it. And it's true, a hundred and fifty a week is not a lot of money, but pay no mind. You need to learn the business and this is the time to do it. Once you pass the Series Seven none of it will matter.
JIM=>Your friends are shit. You're gonna tell them you made twenty-five thousand last month and they're not going to believe you. Fuck them! Your parents don't like the life you lead? Fuck you Mom and Dad! As a trainee you will be building a foundation for yourself. Think of it as the foundation to a building. Right? Gotta build the foundation before you can put up your skyscraper. You know what I built? The fucking twin towers. Now go home and think about whether this is for you. If you decide it isn't, nothing to be embarrassed about. It's not for everyone. But if you really want it, then give me a call on Monday and we'll talk. Just don't waste my time. Alright. That's it.
DEBBIE=>Hey, Seth.
SETH=>Hi...
DEBBIE=>Debbie.
SETH=>I'm so sorr...
DEBBIE=>It's okay. I never told you my name. Besides, you looked pretty frazzled the other day. I'd be surprised if you'd remembered.
SETH=>First day.
DEBBIE=>No shit?
GREG=>These are the D&B cards. Dunn and Bradstreet.
SETH=>Good morning.
GREG=>They're the company that supply us with our leads. Every one of these cards is an opportunity. These are good leads. People on these cards buy stock. Your job is to call them and get them interested in the firm. You're not actually selling stock yet, but you're selling the dream. Get 'em wet and tell them that in a month from now a senior broker will call them back with one idea.
SETH=>Who are these people?
GREG=>Average client's forty-five years old, from the Midwest, two hundred and fifty thousand dollar annual income, three million net. Has a local broker, but loves a New York guy who sounds good on the phone. The card's not gonna tell you any of that. Only says their name, address and occupation. You gotta feel them out. Here. Peter Davis, Vice President of Parks Telecommunications. Guy's probably a whale. See what he's playing with. Truth is it doesn't matter these days. With the DOW where it is now, everyone wants a piece of the market. I can close anyone at any time anywhere in the country. Just give me a phone number.
SHERYL=>Greg, I have John Duncklee on line three.
GREG=>I'm not here. After you qualify the guy you send him a press packet. It's all really easy and it'll get you feeling comfortable on the phone, which is key. This entire business revolves around the phone. A good broker makes over seven hundred calls a day.
SETH=>What's the phone bill like here?
GREG=>This month was approaching four hundred thousand. Now listen to me. Even though you're not actually selling stock yet, I want you to remember the coda we have here. Did you see Glengarry Glenross?
SETH=>Yeah.
GREG=>Alright then, you remember ABC?
SETH=>Always be closing.
GREG=>Right. Always -- Be -- Closing. That's the attitude you need. Always be closing Seth. Telling's not selling. Now there's two rules you need to know as a trainee. The rest will come later. Number one, we do not pitch the bitch here.
SETH=>What?
GREG=>We don't sell stock to women. I don't care who it is, we don't do it. I'm serious. Nancy Sinatra calls, you tell her you're sorry. They're a constant pain in the ass and never worth the trouble. They will call you every fucking day asking you why the stock is dropping. And God forbid the stock should go up you'll hear from them every fifteen minutes. Is it a good time to sell? It's simply not worth the time or effort.
SETH=>Okay, don't pitch the bitch.
GREG=>Second rule. Don't write wood. A lot of trainee are so anxious to get off the phone they just steamroll the guy into getting the press pack so they can hang up. Then I call in a month and say, Hi, you spoke to a junior associate of mine last month. The guy's like, Yeah, I'm not interested. Bye. That's a shitty lead. It's fucking wood. The info we send is bullshit. The important part of the call is telling them you have that one great idea, and that a broker is going to call them back in a month. This shows that we don't just fire a million recos a day. We tell them we have six or seven great ideas a year! They don't want to think you're pitching them something you read in the journal this morning. Get it? No wood.
SETH=>Yeah, I got it. Chill.
GREG=>Don't even start with that shit. I'm just telling you what your place is and what I expect of you. I'm making your job easier.
SETH=>Okay. Well what happens if they want to buy stock right then?
GREG=>Alright, now we're talking. You should go into every call thinking just that. If they want a recommendation, you put the guy on hold, you stand up, and yell "RECO" at the top of your lungs. The first senior broker to get to the phone gets the sale.
ADAM=>Seth! What's up, man? Thought you weren't gonna make it. Sit down, grab a slice, have a beer.
GREG=>Shut-up, shut the fuck up, Gecko's coming. Alright my turn.
GREG=>What the hell's goin' on? I'm lookin' at two hundred shares, pal. I wanna know if we're part of it. We better be or I'm gonna come down and eat your lunch for you. Back in two, Alex.
RICHIE=>Sorry, Jeff. Look, I loved it at forty, it's an insult at fifty. Their analysts? They don't know preferred stock from livestock. Alright, we wait till it hits south, then we, we raise the sperm count on the deal. Get back at ya.
CHRIS=>This is the kid. Calls me fifty-nine days in a row, wants to be a player. Oughta be a picture of you in the dictionary under persistence, kid. Yeah, now listen, Jerry. I'm lookin' for negative control. No more than thirty, thirty-five percent. Just enough to block anybody else's merger plans and find out from the inside if the books are cooked. Looks as good on paper and we're in the kill zone, pal. We'll lock and load. Lunch? Oh you gotta be kidding. Lunch is for wimps. Okay, Fidel, I'll talk at ya.
EVERYONE=>How do you do, Mr. Gecko. Bud Fox.
GREG=>So you say. Nice to meet you. Hope you're intelligent. Where'd you get these?
EVERYONE=>I got a connection at the airport.
GREG=>So what's on your mind, Kimosabi? Why am I listening to you?
DEBBIE=>Mom?
MOTHER=>I'm in bed.
DEBBIE=>Bad day?
MOTHER=>Miserable.
DEBBIE=>Let me make some tea. You sound really congested.
MOTHER=>How was work?
SETH=>I told you, Mom, I'm not a broker yet. I'm a trainee. I still need to pass my series seven test.
MOTHER=>Oh please, you're a stock broker. You wear a suit to work every day, don't you?
SETH=>Yeah?
MOTHER=>So? What are we arguing about then?
SETH=>Thanks Mom.
MOTHER=>You're doing great, Seth. You're working your way up from the bottom. That's never easy. I'm very proud of you. And I told you father about things.
SETH=>What'd he say?
MOTHER=>He's very happy. Shocked, but happy. He's been waiting for you to call him.
SETH=>Well why doesn't he just call me?
MOTHER=>One miracle at a time, okay sweetie?
SETH=>Uh... ...Mr. Mathews please. Seth Davis. From JT Marlin. No, he doesn't know me. Yes it's concerning investments. Hello?
SETH=>Fucking bitch.
MARC=>Tech stocks are down today.
GREG=>Hey Warren Buffet, you trying to e cute? Make the fucking calls! You're not a fund manager! How's it going there, Seth?
SETH=>Hi, Howard Young please. It's Seth Davis from JT Marlin. No, he's not expecting my call. No thanks, I'll call him back.
GREG=>Okay, first of all there are going to be a lot of those regardless of how good you are. But you happen to suck dick. I have this friend who runs this other firm. He gives out this book to all his trainees. The Rebuttal Book. Looks like a fil-o-fax. Has those index tabs but they don't say A to B to G to H, they say things like Wife won't let me, I'm not in the market now, Call me back, Send me a prospectus. Has a rebuttal for any excuse. That's all the shit you're gonna have to learn later. For now you only have to remember one thing. You can be whoever you want on the phone. So say what you have to. Use a different name if you want. Tell them you're a vice- president here. Just get them on the line. That's the first step. It's the hardest part sometimes, but just get the cocksucker on the line.
SETH=>I don't understand. How can I do shit like that? Isn't there a compliance offer here? Isn't it...
GREG=>Illegal? No, Seth. Everyone does that shit. Even on Wall Street. And John over there, he works for us.
GREG=>He's a fucking chimp. The only compliance work he's doing is making sure my lunch is still hot when it gets here. He's only here because the SEC requires it. He might have the easiest fucking job in the entire world. Look at him I think he's actually masturbating right now.
GREG=>Bad news. Stay the fuck away.
CHRIS=>Holy shit. You slut. You made the call.
GREG=>I did.
CHRIS=>And you went big too.
GREG=>I did.
GREG=>Fuckin' A. Only bookie in New York that delivers Federal Express.
MARTY=>So when are you taking the test?
SETH=>After the training program's over. They really want you to get a good idea of how things work before you take the series seven. It's a great system. I'm really learning a lot. They're very thorough.
NEIL=>Are you gonna be rich, Seth?
SETH=>I hope so.
MOTHER=>God willing.
MARTY=>I gotta ask you: how come I've never heard of this firm?
SETH=>They're a small firm, Dad. There's a million others just like it that you've never heard of either.
MARTY=>I guess what I'm asking is why you didn't try and go straight to Goldman Sachs or a company of that stature.
MOTHER=>Marty, why are you starting?
SETH=>It's okay, Mom. The reason, Dad, is that the larger houses don't hire kids straight out of college unless you went to an Ivy League school or you want to do cash-flow analysis for the next fifteen years. They want you to work outside their firm for a couple of years to get a sense of the marketplace. That's why almost all brokers start in small firms like JT Marlin.
MARTY=>See, that wasn't so bad. He answered the question. This is good stuff, Seth. Good stuff. So how does it feel to have a real job?
SETH=>It feels real good, Dad.
MARTY=>All you have to do now is close the casino.
MOTHER=>Marty! We talked about this.
SETH=>I hate to run, but I'm late to meet a friend.
SETH=>Debbie.
DEBBIE=>Hey Seth. Go get yourself a drink.
SETH=>So who do you live with?
DEBBIE=>Oh, you mean is the black girl here taking care of her grandma because her momma's a crack-head?
SETH=>Yeah, exactly. I thought it was smack, though. You know you have got to get a hold of that edge. It's kind of sharp sometimes.
DEBBIE=>I know, it's true. I just got so much shit at JT. Sometimes I have to get into that mode just to fend them off.
SETH=>So why are you there? It doesn't seem like the ideal working environment for a black woman.
DEBBIE=>No, it isn't. But tell me, how many secretaries you know make eighty thousand a year?
SETH=>One.
DEBBIE=>Exactly.
SETH=>You could always go back to school.
DEBBIE=>You pompous ass. What makes you think I want to? College isn't for everyone. It's not like every black girl dreams of being a marine-biologist her whole life. If only she could get out of the ghetto.
SETH=>Hey, you don't have to tell me. I dropped out.
DEBBIE=>Really? Now that's a surprise.
SETH=>You know it isn't for everyone. It's not like every Jewish boy wants to be a CPA if only he could make Wharton's.
SETH=>Whoa. I don't even know what synagogue you belong to.
RICHIE=>Yo. I thought this shit was a broker hangout. Merryl Lynch, Solomon Bros, the big dicks.
GREG=>Yeah. What is this? Looks like an insurance salesman convention.
DEBBIE=>You don't fit in there. You know that? They're all white trash. To them, this is going legit.
SETH=>What do you mean by that?
DEBBIE=>Always talking about being a big swinging dick on Wall Street. It's funny, 'cause Long Island is as close as they're ever going to get. But you could be doing the real thing at a real trading house. Instead you're here. You don't need to be making it this way. At a chop-shop.
SETH=>What are you saying? JT isn't a chop- shop. We just push the envelope a little. I mean it's not like we do anything illegal. We just push a little. Same as on Wall Street.
SETH=>What?
DEBBIE=>You don't have to convince me.
DEBBIE=>To bending the rules.
SETH=>Alright. That I can handle.
JP BROKER=>Hey. You guys looking for a broker?
RICHIE=>Who the fuck are you?
CHRIS=>Easy Richie, would you?
JP BROKER=>I thought maybe you guys were looking for someone to invest for you.
GREG=>Hey pal. We ARE brothers.
JP BROKER=>Really? You guys with Jacoby & Myers?
ADAM=>JT Marlin.
JP BROKER=>Never heard of it.
CHRIS=>Hey! Hold on a second. Who are you? You sell car insurance or something?
JP BROKER=>We're with JP Morgan.
RICHIE=>Yeah right. And I'm a black Negro.
JP BROKER=>What the fuck is with those suits? You look like you're on Gotti's crew.
DEBBIE=>So tell me about your family.
SETH=>My family? It's a mess.
DEBBIE=>Whose isn't?
SETH=>Yeah I guess. Well my mom's great. Real supportive and loving. Almost to a flaw. I can do no wrong.
DEBBIE=>Sounds terrible.
SETH=>My dad's the mess, but that's not very interesting conversation. What about you?
DEBBIE=>Mom raised me. No money. Now I'm taking care of her.
SETH=>What's wrong?
DEBBIE=>Chronic pneumonia. Smoked for fifteen years. She's been sick for a while now. It makes her so happy that I make this salary so I can support us. It's a little scary.
SETH=>And your Dad?
DEBBIE=>Rather not talk about my father either.
SETH=>Boy, I'm so glad we had this conversation. I really feel like I've gained this insight into your life.
DEBBIE=>And me into yours.
DEBBIE=>Tell me something real.
SETH=>What do you want to hear?
DEBBIE=>Tell me a story about your dad.
SETH=>Well I have so many great ones.
DEBBIE=>Tell me.
SETH=>Okay. I'm ten years old. I just got this new bike. A red Mongoose. You know, BMX. So I'm skidding out in this puddle -- Starsky & Hutch style. My foot slips, and the pedal spins around hard enough to break my leg. Real bad too. But I don't fall off the bike. I keep coasting down this hill. So finally I get scared and I jump off. Fell right behind a parked car. Laid there for half an hour. Finally, I hear my father screaming my name from up the block. I was so happy that he was coming to get me. He comes around the car and sees me lying there. There's blood everywhere and the bone is sticking out straight through my skin.
DEBBIE=>Oh my god.
SETH=>I looked up at him, and for the first time in my life I saw how much he loved me. He was frozen. It hurt him to see me in that much pain. So he leans down... and slaps me across the face.
DEBBIE=>What? Why?
SETH=>I don't know. Maybe he was mad at me for making him that helpless, or it was the only thing he could think of. I don't really care anymore. What I remember now is the look on his face when he first saw me. That's all I remember. That's what I miss.
DEBBIE=>I'm so sorry.
GREG=>Can we get the fuck out of here now?
SETH=>I'm sorry, sir, I didn't realize...
DR. JACOBS=>I'm really busy, Seth.
SETH=>I understand. I'm real busy here myself, Doctor. Look, we're going to come back to you in a month with one idea and one idea only. If you like what we have to say, great, we'll do business. Worst case scenario you'll hear yourself a new business idea. Chat about it with your golfing buddies and we'll part as friends. That's fair, right?
DR. JACOBS=>Ummm what?
SETH=>Great. So tell me, Doc, are you working with a million dollars in the market right now?
DR. JACOBS=>Who is this again?
SETH=>Tell me something, you're a doctor. Have you ever heard of a drug called Fenamul? It's being manufactured by MSC pharmaceuticals.
DR. JACOBS=>No.
SETH=>Well it's in the third stage of FDA approval right now. Word is, it's going to get approved in the next three months. Could be tomorrow for all I know. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. And you're real busy over there. Why don't I send you out the info you requested about the firm and a senior broker will call you next month with that one idea.
DR. JACOBS=>Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second, forget the info, let's talk about this now. What was the name of the drug again?
SETH=>You know what, sir, let me pass you on to a senior broker who's more involved with this particular stock. Hold on a second.
SETH=>Reco!!
CHRIS=>Card.
SETH=>Okay, his name's Dr. Jacobs and from the sound of it, I'd say he's definitely...
CHRIS=>Whoa, whoa, I don't wanna hear it, kid.
CHRIS=>Hi, Dr. Jacobs, this is Chris Marlin over at JT Marlin.
DR. JACOBS=>Marlin?
CHRIS=>Right. He's my father.
CHRIS=>So my associate tells me you're interested in one of our stocks.
DR. JACOBS=>Yes, MSC sounds like it might be interesting.
CHRIS=>Might be? Might be doesn't sell stock at the rate MSC is going, Dr. Jacobs. We're talking about very high volume here.
DR. JACOBS=>Well, I still have to run it by my people.
CHRIS=>That's great, Doc. If you want to miss yet another opportunity here and go watch your colleagues get rich doing clinical trials, then don't buy a share and hang up the phone.
DR. JACOBS=>Well hold on a second. I didn't say that. I just wanted to talk more about it.
CHRIS=>Honestly Doc, I don't have the time. This stock is blowing up right now. The whole firm is going nuts. Let me open the door to my office.
CHRIS=>You hear that? That's my trading floor, Doc. Now I have a million calls to make to other doctors who are already in the know. I can't walk you through this right now. I'm sorry.
DR. JACOBS=>Okay, okay. Let's do this.
CHRIS=>Now, since you're a new account I cannot go any higher than two thousand shares. I'd love to but I just can't do it.
DR. JACOBS=>Two thousand?! Whoa! That's way more than I was thinking about. Two thousand, Jesus. I'm just curious, why can't you sell me more than that?
CHRIS=>Well, we like to establish a relationship with our clients on something small before we get to the more serious trades. Let me show you several percentage points on this small trade and then we'll talk about doing future business.
DR. JACOBS=>That sounds good. Give me two thousand shares.
CHRIS=>Done.
DR. JACOBS=>You sure you can't do any better on this one?
CHRIS=>No, I'm sorry, Dr. Jacobs.
DR. JACOBS=>Alright, let's start with this trade then.
CHRIS=>Great. I promise we'll go big on the next one. Now do you want the confirmation sent to your office or your mansion?
DR. JACOBS=>Very funny, Mr. Marlin.
CHRIS=>Alright, let me put my secretary on. She'll take your info.
CHRIS=>Done and done.
CHRIS=>I love doctors, man. All that money and not a clue what to do with it. Fucking rollovers. Hold onto your ankles, Doc, here comes the love.
SETH=>Why'd you put a max on his buy?
CHRIS=>Didn't you tell him how it works?
GREG=>He's still a trainee. He doesn't need to know about initial sell limits.
CHRIS=>Right, right. Make sure he shows you the ropes. He's too busy calling his bookie. You fucking Hebrews, man. Always looking out for yourselves, never the trainees.
GREG=>That's great. Why don't you go back to little Italy now?
CHRIS=>Why don't you go make a latke dreidel boy. The reason I capped him is in case he's a piker. See, we're going to go ahead and front the money for this sale. If he doesn't send the check, I'm the one holding the bag. Last commission month a kid on Jim's team wrote a million dollar ticket. Stock was down three and a half points by settlement. Fucking kid took a one quarter million dollar hit. Besides, first sale just whets the appetite. If he's a whale, which it looks like he is, then I'll get him on a day when there's a real rip.
SETH=>Rip?
CHRIS=>Rip. Commission. That's why we work here. We get huge rips.
SETH=>I actually still don't know how it works.
CHRIS=>A two dollar rip, which is unheard of anywhere on Wall Street, means you're walking away with two dollars for every share you sell. Real money. Jesus Greg, you tell him where the bathroom is yet?
GREG=>Seth, I showed you where Chris' desk is.
SETH=>How does Michael afford that?
CHRIS=>I don't know, but if he's doing it, he's making money on it. Point is, don't worry about selling small on the first trade. You service the client right and he'll be back for more. Bide your time. Show him a three percent return and he'll trust you to watch his kids for the weekend. If he's serviced correctly it's not a matter of whether he's making a second trade with you, it's a matter of how much.
CHRIS=>Gotta bounce.
DIRECTOR=>Of all the people at JT Marlin you picked this kid Davis. Why?
TRUE=>Because he's perfect. He's new, so his loyalties don't run that deep. He also seems to be the smartest of this last group of trainees. Used to run a full time casino out of his house in Queens. Now he just picks up the checks. He's more ambitious than any other trainee there. And I mean by a lot. The rest of them are fucking idiots to this kid. He'll turn state's. No question.
DIRECTOR=>How are you gonna get to him?
TRUE=>I'm working on that. We just started surveillance. We'll get to him.
CHRIS=>What were you doing before you came on?
GREG=>You mean worked.
ADAM=>No, it doesn't.
CHRIS=>What about you, Seth? What were you doing before you found JT?
SETH=>Well I was, actually still am, involved in the gaming industry.
CHRIS=>Really! AC, Foxwoods, Vegas?
SETH=>Atlantic City.
CHRIS=>What'd you do there?
SETH=>I won.
CHRIS=>You wanna roll, slut?
SETH=>You wanna lose?
CHRIS=>Oh shit, we got a player.
CHRIS=>I got one-fitty against.
RICHIE=>Booked!
ADAM=>I got one hundred against.
SETH=>Booked. Wait, who's got the roller?
CHRIS=>come on, somebody cover Greg.
MICHAEL=>Alright, I got the roller. I can't believe you guys aren't fighting over it. Betting against Greg's roll is the only sure thing there is in the world. What are we going, two hundred dollars on this?
GREG=>Booked.
GREG=>Let's go get some reserves.
LOCAL=>Quit staring and just apologize.
RICHIE=>He doesn't have to say shit. Now why don't you go back to your Heineken and shut the fuck up.
LOCAL=>Was I talking to you?
RICHIE=>Do I give a shit? If you're talking to me, then you're talking to me and my fucking crew.
GREG=>You okay?
SETH=>I just, I, I'm a little disturbed you know. I mean Jesus didn't that bother you?
GREG=>Me? You think I was watching? I can't look at that stuff, makes me nauseous. You have to understand. These are not the kids you and I grew up with. Remember in Hebrew school when a shoving match was a big deal? Worst case scenario, someone's yarmulka got knocked off.
SETH=>It's true.
GREG=>These guys are no joke. They get tanked up, throw a quick fist. And then some of them actually like it. Like Richie. He probably thought I was being tough back there, just staring at that guy. I was shitting my pants.
SETH=>I saw.
GREG=>Thanks. Those fucking Guineas, half of them do coke. They all drink. No stability, zero capital. They make all this money and they're always living three steps ahead. Do you know there are guys in this firm that make close to a million a year and couldn't get a loan for a Honda because their credit is so bad. Everyone's just waiting for the fifteenth of the month. It's like they may drive a Porsche but they don't have ten bucks to put in the gas tank. Nigger rich.
SETH=>Hey, drop me off. I want to get my car. I don't think I'm going to stay at the bar much longer.
GREG=>Alright, I'll see you back at Mickey's then. Oh, on the other thing.
SETH=>Yeah?
GREG=>Don't forget what I told you about Debbie. She's trouble.
SETH=>I don't even...
GREG=>Seth, I see what goes on. And I'm telling you as your friend, she's a whore, Seth. A fucking whore.
SETH=>Good thing you stopped dating her, huh?
SETH=>Holy shit.
JIM=>I want to talk to you about appearance. Most of you dress like shit. I don't know what your financial situation is like right now but you need to buy at least one decent suit. There is a minimum level of aesthetic professionalism that we have here. In a couple of months you'll be able to outfit your whole closet, but for now just get something to hold you over. There's an important phrase that we use here and I think it's time you all learned it. "Act as if". Do you understand what that means? Act as if you are the fucking president of this firm. Act as if you have a nine inch cock. Act as if. To do this properly you need to at least look the part. So go get dressed. Secondly, it's time to get your Series Seven books. No need to get nervous. If you study you'll pass. Then you begin trading as an SEC licensed broker. Then you're a fucking millionaire. It's that simple. I need three hundred from each of you for the books which will be returned if and when you pass the exam. And I'll need that tomorrow.
MARC=>I'll just ask my mom.
JIM=>Okay then.
SETH=>Here you go.
JIM=>What are you, last night's erection?
SETH=>Yeah, you know.
CHRIS=>Go ahead do it. Just try it, you'll see.
SETH=>You sure?
CHRIS=>Yeah. You're gonna feel so much better.
SETH=>Yeah hi, Steve? FUCK YOU!
CLIENT=>Look, Seth, Seth, I don't want to be rude.
SETH=>Bob, be rude, be rude. Hang up the phone. You won't. You wanna know why? Because you see value! I'm money in the bank. I'm your kid's college fund for Christ's sake. That's great. If we were looking at a long stock over a long term period I'd be talking about PE ratios and earnings with you right now. The fact is, I'm not looking to marry the stock. We're in, we're out, three, four weeks. Look, I'm not a rookie broker opening accounts for a living.
SETH=>What do you mean you'll pass? Alan, the only people making money passing are NFL quarterbacks and I don't see a number on your back.
SETH=>Yes, how are you, James? Seth Marlin over at JT Marlin.
JAMES=>Take me off your list!!
SETH=>Okay, I'll take you off my list of successful people today.
SETH=>Listen, if you couldn't pull three thousand together your name wouldn't be on my desk during business hours. What do you mean you don't have it? John, please, you're embarrassing me. I'm pitching you from under my desk. I'm embarrassed.
SETH=>Holy shit.
SETH=>Christ, they're all the same.
DEBBIE=>What's the name?
SETH=>Shit. You scared me. How long have you been standing there?
DEBBIE=>I just walked up now. I'm sorry.
DEBBIE=>Interesting reading?
SETH=>This? It's just the prospectus from the last IPO the firm put out.
DEBBIE=>I know what it is. I asked you if it was interesting. You may be the first person to ever read a JT prospectus. What are you looking for?
SETH=>Some chocolate love. Should I practice my pitch? I know it turns you on.
SETH=>I saw John Feiner shredding a bunch of documents the other night.
DEBBIE=>What?
SETH=>Yeah. He was in the back late at night. I was going to get my bag.
DEBBIE=>Did he see you?
SETH=>No. What's going on over there?
DEBBIE=>What do you mean? You know what's going on.
SETH=>You think they're doing a lot of illegal shit?
DEBBIE=>Come on, Seth, you can't have it both ways. You say you like the hard sell and the money but then you question it when you see something that's a bit off. Either admit that it's not charity work and enjoy, or get out. But going back and forth like this is just tearing you up.
SETH=>Dean, I'm not a rookie broker opening accounts for a living. Ask me whatever you want. But I'll tell you this. I'm going to give you over to my secretary. You call me when the stock doubles.
GREG=>What happened?
ADAM=>Seth just closed this guy for ten large.
GREG=>Hey Seth, get over here.
SETH=>Hey Greg, I just closed this huge account for you.
GREG=>What the fuck are you doing? You just violated a huge SEC regulation. Who told you to start closing accounts. You're a fucking trainee.
SETH=>You're kidding right? You're not? You told me I could use a different name on the phone. Act as if! I figured I'd take the initiative and make you some money.
CHRIS=>Greg, I was standing right next to him the whole time. I would have stepped right in if the kid got into trouble.
GREG=>Hey! You got a conoli you can stick in your mouth.
CHRIS=>No. You got a menorah you can shove in your ass?
GREG=>I don't care about the money, Seth. Imagine if every trainee started handling their own recos. This shop would be closed in about a week.
SETH=>This is about something else. Isn't it?
GREG=>What would that be?
GREG=>Don't you have to answer the phones or something?
GREG=>We'll finish this later.
JIM=>Hey Seth. You just earned a spot pal. Get in here.
GREG=>Big time baby. We'll get to see if you're as good as you say you are. It gets pretty fucking hectic in there, little man.
GREG=>What the fuck was that? Don't tell me he's why we're not hitting it anymore.
DEBBIE=>Hitting it? We were never hitting it. And he's not the reason, Greg, you are.
TRUE=>Special Agent True, FBI, this is Agent Etkin. Ms. Hilliard, we'd like to talk to you about your relationship with Seth Dais. Oh, and about your mom's health.
SETH=>Hello?
SALESMAN=>Hi, this is Ron calling you from the Daily News. How you doing this morning?
SETH=>I'm not interested.
SALESMAN=>Okay. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Have a nice day.
SETH=>That's it? That's your pitch? You consider that a sales call??!
SALESMAN=>Well, ummm...
SETH=>You want to sell me a paper right? Well you guys call me every Saturday and I get the same half-assed attempt. You wanna close me? Then sell me.
SALESMAN=>Alright.
SETH=>Go ahead, start again.
SALESMAN=>Okay... Hi, this is Ron from the Daily News. How you doing this morning?
SETH=>Shitty. What do you want?
SALESMAN=>It's not what I want, sir... it's what you want.
SETH=>Alright, now you're talking. What are you selling?
SALESMAN=>I'm offering you a subscription to the Daily News at a substantially reduced price. We're trying to reach out to people that have never had home delivery before.
SETH=>So, everyone else that already has a subscription is getting fucked on this one huh?
SALESMAN=>...Yeah, I guess so.
SETH=>Good, I can live with that. Now why do I want your paper? Maybe I should get the Times or the Voice.
SALESMAN=>Well the Village Voice is free, sir, so if you want it you should certainly pick it up. But the Daily News offers you something no other paper can, a real taste of New York. We have some writers on staff that have been with us for over fifteen years. We have the best features! More photographs than any other daily in New York! And we have the most reliable delivery in the city! Now what do you think??!!
SETH=>Alright, Ron. Now that was a sales call. Good job!
SALESMAN=>So are you going to buy a subscription?
SETH=>No. I already get the Times.
SETH=>What?
CHRIS=>Well I thought we'd start out with a couple of drinks, then maybe dinner. Then depending on how things go, a little ya-ya.
SETH=>Shut-up slut.
CHRIS=>You da slut.
SETH=>Alright. I'll be the slut. So what's up?
CHRIS=>Wanted to know what the story was for later. It's your night so you decide, Mr. Junior Broker.
SETH=>Well, I was thinking that we should go into the city. You guys are always drinking at those shitty local bars. I say we go to a decent bar with decent poo-poo. If I have to look at one more housewife smoking a Newport I'm gonna fucking puke.
CHRIS=>Come on in. I want you to meet my mother.
SETH=>Jesus. Am I the only one who doesn't live with their mother?
CHRIS=>You want something to drink?
SETH=>Nah, I'm okay. Hey let me ask you something, Chris. Do you ever wonder how we get the rips that we do? I mean how is it that we get rips that pay out ten times the amount of any major firm?
CHRIS=>Are you kidding me? That's the wrong question to be asking. Who cares how. The only thing you should be wondering about is how you're gonna get laid tonight.
SETH=>I'm serious. Did you know that SEC regulations state that a maximum rip allowed is five percent of the sale. We're making four times that.
CHRIS=>What are you doing, Seth? Aren't you happy with the way things are going?
SETH=>Yes.
CHRIS=>So what are you doing making trouble for yourself?
SETH=>Nothing. I'm just curious. Aren't you?
CHRIS=>No. Not at all.
RICHIE=>That's it right there, baby. That's where I'm gonna be next year. I'm gonna get me a phat space in Tribeca. Then all you punks can come see what real living is.
GREG=>Yeah right. You'll still be at exit 53 off the LIE motherfucker.
ROGER=>Jesus Christ, look at this. They love us.
RICHIE=>We have got so hang out in the city more often.
HOST=>Five for dinner?
STEVE=>And then some.
ROGER=>Oh shit. They're giving us the phattest table in the place.
HOST=>Oh, I'm so sorry. This table is actually reserved for a party of six. I have a table for you in the back though.
STEVE=>Hey! We are a party of six. See, there's six of us. We want this table.
HOST=>I'm sorry it isn't available. Now follow me.
RICHIE=>Who UAT'd this Budweiser for me?
ROGER=>I did, what's wrong?
RICHIE=>I hate Bud, send this shit back.
SETH=>Uat?
CHRIS=>Unauthorized Trade.
SETH=>Gotcha.
STEVE=>So Seth, any grips yet?
SETH=>Yeah. You know what I hate? Getting past the secretaries. It doesn't matter that you're a broker calling from NYC. It's still a sales call and that they know.
STEVE=>It's true. It don't matter if it's the Avon lady or Merryl Lynch. The good secretaries can smell a sales call.
CHRIS=>I remember when I was cold calling, the shit I'd do. I'd get on the phone and say, Can I speak to Jim? Secretary's like, I'm sorry, but Jim isn't in the office. I'd be like, that's funny because I just saw his car in the lot about five minutes ago. Next thing you know, Jimbo's on the phone because you showed the lady you weren't fuckin' around.
ROGER=>You guys have it easy. JT Marlin could be any kind of company. I have to get on the phone and say, Hi, it's Roger from Investments Incorporated. Secretary's like, "Is this concerning investments?" Ummmm, no?
SETH=>You guys know what I'm going to do?
GREG=>What the fuck do you know? You just passed your seven this week. Haven't even popped your cherry yet.
SETH=>I'm going to open a fire called Bob's plumbing. You get on the phone and say, Yeah tell him it's Bob from Bob's plumbing. He'll be like, Oh, it's the plumber guy, yeah I'll take the call. Everyone talks to their plumber.
GREG=>Alright guys. I want to make a toast to the man of the night. Highest Series Seven score in the whole firm. You are the big swinging dick tonight.
CHRIS=>Cheers, slut.
RICHIE=>You know why he's this happy, Seth?
SETH=>Oh I know. He's thinking about the forty accounts I have to open for him before I'm on my own. God bless the junior broker program, huh, Greg?
GREG=>Oh, I don't care about that. I'm just excited for your promising future.
GAY MAN=>Hey, do you guys think you could keep it down some.
SETH=>Yeah, no problem.
STEVE=>Why don't you guys just concentrate on your food instead of us.
RICHIE=>Hey, what are you eating over there anyway? A little tube snake smothered in underwear?
STEVE=>I heard the hot dogs are real good here too. They got foot-longs. You like those right? A little tough to swallow, but they're good.
GAY MAN=>Great outfits, you guys just come from a City Council meeting? Or you just trying to score with the bridge and tunnel crowd?
STEVE=>You know what they should do with you guys? They should put all of you on a fucking island somewhere.
GAY MAN=>Yeah, guess what?
STEVE=>What?!
GAY MAN=>You're on it!
HARRY=>Hello?
SETH=>Hi Harry, this is Seth Davis over at JT Marlin. How you doing this afternoon?
HARRY=>Fine, thanks.
SETH=>You got a call from an associate broker of mine last month and I just wanted to know if you enjoyed the information we sent you.
HARRY=>What information?
SETH=>If you get as much mail as I do you probably brushed it aside, but more importantly we made a commitment to get back to you. I am presenting you with an investment opportunity that I think you'll find very interesting.
HARRY=>Well thanks, but I'm not really in the market for that right now.
SETH=>Tell me Harry, are you married or happy?
HARRY=>Actually, I've been married for ten years.
SETH=>Oh yeah? Six years for me.
HARRY=>They're great, aren't they?
SETH=>Yeah, they sure are. So, are you playing the market at all?
HARRY=>Well I don't know about playing. I do own some blue chips. They were actually wedding gifts from our friends in New York.
SETH=>Well, I'm calling to tell you about an explosive situation we have going on right now. A pharmaceutical company, Farrow Tech has a drug called Parattin in the third stage of FDA approval.
HARRY=>What does it do?
SETH=>Good question, Harry. Good question. This is the best part. It helps premature babies develop properly.
HARRY=>Sound like a great drug.
SETH=>It is. Tell me, those Blue Chips you own, what have they done for you since you got married?
HARRY=>Not much really.
SETH=>Well you see, we deal in stocks that really move.
ADAM=>Oh yeah, they really move.
SETH=>I would love to show you what I mean and I can do so on a relatively small investment.
HARRY=>I really can't buy anything right now, Seth. My wife and I are buying a house this month and we're saving every last penny.
SETH=>Look, I don't care how much stock you pick up. I just want you to test me out. Harry, I want you to judge me on the percentages I show you. Obviously I show you thirty or forty percent, no matter how big or small your position is you're gonna get pretty excited about my next idea, right?
HARRY=>Well yeah.
SETH=>Of course you would. You'd be handing out my business cards, wouldn't you?
SETH=>Pick up one hundred shares. It's the absolute firm minimum. Okay, if I show you three or four points on the trade it's not going to make you rich. On the same token, if the stock doesn't go anywhere you're not out in front of your store with a cup in your hand.
HARRY=>No, that's true.
SETH=>Look Harry, the truth is I could sell you a lot more than one hundred shares and feel completely comfortable about the trade, but I'm asking you to start small just to prove what I can do for you.
HARRY=>Alright.
SETH=>Great! Should I send the confirmation to your business or your home?
HARRY=>Well I just have to talk to my wife first. Then I'll call you right back.
SETH=>You don't have to do that, Harry. And I going to lunch in five minutes.
HARRY=>No. I have to talk to her first.
SETH=>I have to ask you something here, Harry. You're at work now, aren't you?
HARRY=>Yes.
SETH=>Well what do you do, Harry?
HARRY=>I'm the purchasing manager for a gourmet foods company.
SETH=>Does part of your job involve making decisions?
HARRY=>Well of course.
SETH=>Alright, well when you make one of these decisions do you call your wife to ask her what you should do?
HARRY=>No, of course not. But that's a little bit...
SETH=>Different? How? It's your money, you earned it. Besides, all you're doing is investing it. I'm not selling crack here, Harry. I mean she's only going to be happy when she sees you've made a wise investment for the family. Just think of the flip side. When your wife does the shopping does she call you from Pathmark to ask you if she can use the coupons for Captain Crunch?
HARRY=>Come on, that's not fair.
SETH=>I'm just trying to make a point here, Harry. We're not talking about a lot of money. Just think what she's going to say when you bring her back a big fat check because you had the foresight to see a good thing coming.
HARRY=>Alright, let's try it.
TRUE=>This kid is really good. God, he's gonna go down hard.
SETH=>So what's the deal here?
CHRIS=>Michael always addresses the firm when there's a new issue coming out. It's always good news. I heard we might be taking a trip south after this meeting.
MICHAEL=>How's everybody doing?
MICHAEL=>Good to hear. First thing, I wanted to congratulate you all on a huge month. For any of you not yet convinced, these were the top dogs for the month: Jim Young -- $280,000. Chris Varick - $205,000. Greg Feinstein - $190,000.
MICHAEL=>This month is going to be bigger. It's actually going to be the biggest month we've ever had. We've got a new issue I want to talk to you about. It's called Med Patent. They've just designed the world's first retractable syringe. This means that doctors and nurses will never again have to worry about infection from dirty needles. This is not going to be an alternative in the medical world, it's going to be the standard. We all know we're here to make money, but if we can do something good like this, then all the better. So I want you all to go out and buy yourselves a new car, or a house. Whatever you want. Go into debt. You will make a million inside of six months.
MICHAEL=>Now, onto matters of recreation. We're taking a class trip tonight so call the ladies and tell them not to wait up.
TODD=>Hey Seth, you want some of this? Just get in line, bro.
SETH=>Nah, that's alright. I'm gonna go hit the tables.
TODD=>Fuckin' fag.
SETH=>That's me. Can't get enough dick.
DEBBIE=>What's wrong, baby?
SETH=>What's wrong? Everything, it feels like. Not you, but everything else.
DEBBIE=>What is it?
SETH=>Things aren't right at work. I'm sick of opening accounts for Greg.
DEBBIE=>But you're almost done, baby.
DEBBIE=>There's something else. It's your father.
SETH=>...Yeah, actually, it is. We're finally getting along. I mean we're having lunch next week on his request. Do you know how happy that shit makes me?!
DEBBIE=>I do.
SETH=>But it's all based on this fucking job. This very legitimate respectable job. A job he can tell his friends about during the Yom Kippur appeal. And it's all bullshit.
DEBBIE=>Then you'll quit. You'll tell him what was happening and he'll respect you for walking away.
SETH=>I can't do that! I've invested too much time and energy.
DEBBIE=>Talk to me, Seth.
SETH=>I figured out how Michael's making his money. I almost wish I hadn't; because it's all illegal.
DEBBIE=>It really is, huh? Well we knew it was shady. So how's he doing it?
SETH=>It's called bridge financing. It's so simple. A group of investors make a loan to a private company. Let's say for three million. After the company gets taken public they pay back a million in cash and the other two they pay back in common stock, but at the IPO price. So the investors basically get two million worth of IPO stock. Then they can sell it on the open market at triple what they bought it for. Now that's actually all legal as long as the investors are not tied to the brokerage house. But Michael's friends are the investors on every IPO we do.
DEBBIE=>That's why all the names were the same on the contracts.
SETH=>Right. Then he has us push it all on the open market. We're selling Michael's shares. That's where the two dollar rips come in. He can afford to pay us that much. He's still in an obscene profit margin. It's to his advantage to give us those rips. He has to motivate us to push these stocks. He depends on us to literally create the market. It's all artificial demand. There's no other firm selling this shit. That's why he's always telling us to go into debt. He wants us hungry. Then as soon as we sell off Michael's position there's no need to maintain the inflated price anymore. We stop pushing it and it crashes. And get this. The last IPO, Med Patent, it's cardboard. No research and development, no employees, not even a fucking building. Annual reports are all bullshit. Michael manufactures them. Med Patent doesn't exist.
DEBBIE=>Jesus Christ, Seth. Now what?
SETH=>Now? I don't know. Maybe now I go do it for myself.
SETH=>Jeff! Come on up here!
SETH=>What's going on? One week I can understand, but this is approaching four months, and we're down forty percent from the last month I was here full time.
JEFF=>What the fuck do you want from me? I'm not you, Seth. I'm not going to kill myself for half the profit. You get to come in here and just pick up your money and it sucks.
SETH=>What? It's my business. I created it, remember? You used to make ten dollars an hour. Now you're pulling in a thousand a week. And you're still not happy? What the fuck is that? And you still haven't answered me as to why profits are down this much. What's going on, Jeff?!
JEFF=>Nothing, you can check the tapes.
SETH=>For what? I didn't say anything. You skimming, Jeff?
JEFF=>No I'm not. Look, we've been closing earlier than usual and we've been opening later. I can't handle the twenty-four hour gig anymore, Seth. This isn't Denny's. I'm trying to finish school here.
SETH=>Alright look, why don't you take on another partner and split your end which I'll up to sixty-five percent. Then you can work at night and go to school during the day.
JEFF=>I'm already doing that.
SETH=>You are?
JEFF=>Yeah, I took Dave on last month.
SETH=>And you still can't handle it?
JEFF=>No.
SETH=>Fuck!!
SARA=>Daddy! You look ridiculous.
MAX=>No, it's funny, Dad. Keep going.
MAX=>Hey Dad, my pee smells funny after I eat this stuff.
SARA=>Yeah, mine too!
SUSAN=>Okay guys, let's settle down. You really have a knack at stimulating great conversation with the kids.
HARRY=>Yeah, it's a talent huh? I found out that the new medical program includes dental.
SUSAN=>Are you serious? That's great. You hear this, kids? You're going to get to go to the dentist for free.
MAX=>Great job, Dad.
SUSAN=>Harry, who's JT Marlin?
HARRY=>Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. I brought a little bit of stock.
SUSAN=>What did you buy?
HARRY=>Oh, it's this great pharmaceutical company that's poised for a big jump. They make this new drug that helps premature babies survive their initial three months. Isn't that great?
SUSAN=>How much did you buy?
HARRY=>Nothing crazy, Susan. Just a hundred shares.
SUSAN=>At with price?
HARRY=>Eight dollars. Take it easy hon.
SUSAN=>How did you even know who to call?
HARRY=>Well actually, he called me.
SUSAN=>Who did?
HARRY=>Seth Davis. The broker. He's a really great guy. Family man actually.
SUSAN=>How did he get your name?
HARRY=>I have no idea.
SETH=>Doesn't that worry you?
HARRY=>No, not particularly. Hey look, it's okay!
HARRY=>It's a small investment and I'm just testing this guy out. If he doesn't show us any gains on this trade then I won't do business with him again.
JIM=>This is gonna be a quick one, boys. You passed your sevens over a month ago, and yet no one has opened the necessary forty accounts for their team leader yet. Seth is the only one of you that's even close.
JIM=>I did it in twenty-six days when I was a junior broker. You're not sending out press packets anymore. None of this Debbie the Time Life operator shit. It's time to go to work. Get on the phones and be aggressive. I remember this guy once called me to sell me some stock. I let him pitch me. I got every fucking rebuttal out of this guy. Kept him on the phone for an hour and a half. Toward the end I started asking him buying questions. Like, what's the firm minimum? That's a buying question. I ask a question like that, he should take me down. It's not like I asked him what his 800 number was. That's a fuck off question. I was giving him a run but he blew it. To a question like, What's the firm minimum the answer is zero! You don't like the idea, don't pick up a single share. This putz is telling me... ...ummm, a hundred shares? Wrong answer! You have to learn how to close. Always be closing! You have to push. Keep asking questions. Ask rhetorical ones just to get a yes out of them. If you were drowning and I threw you a life jacket would you grab it? Yes? Good. Pick up two hundred shares, I won't let you down. Ask a guy if he'll let you down. Ask a guy if he'll be happy to see thirty to forty percent return. What's he gonna say? Fuck you, I don't want to see those returns?
JIM=>Stop laughing, it's not funny. If you can't close then start thinking about another career. I'm serious. I am dead serious about that. Have your rebuttals ready. Anybody says call me tomorrow, that's bullshit! Anybody says they got money problems about two hundred shares is lying. You know what I say to that? Tell me you don't like my idea, tell me you don't like my firm, tell me you don't like my fucking tie, but don't tell me you can't pull twenty five hundred together. You hear me, boys? There is no such thing as a "no sale" call. A sale is made on every call you make. You either sell the client some stock or he sells you a reason he can't. Either way it's a sale. The question is, who's gonna close, you or him? Be relentless! Alright, I'm done.
CHRIS=>How smooth is that motherfucker?
SETH=>Too smooth.
SETH=>So Chris, I've been reading the contracts.
CHRIS=>For the IPO's? I was just kidding. No one really reads them.
SETH=>Yeah, okay. Anyway the company we're selling now that makes that retractable syringe...
CHRIS=>Med Patent.
SETH=>Right. Well, I was reading their prospectus and... Well, they don't fill the minimum requirements to be taken public.
CHRIS=>Seth, you just started here. You can't possibly know what the fuck you're talking about. You didn't even finish college.
SETH=>Listen to me. To float a stock , you need at least two years worth of audited financial statements. They don't have any.
CHRIS=>Look Seth. I thought we already went through this. You're a good kid, and I like you a lot, but this is bullshit. Michael knows all about this stuff. We don't. He doesn't tell you how to trade, so don't tell him how to do his business. He's the reason we make bank, and he hasn't steered us wrong, ever.
SETH=>Chris. I went to the address listed on the prospectus. It's an abandoned building.
CHRIS=>Listen to me, Seth, and listen good. I will back you up against Greg or anybody else that fucks with you. But on this I am telling you to shut the fuck up. You will not rock this boat.
CHRIS=>Now how many more accounts do you owe Greg?
SETH=>Three.
CHRIS=>So you'll be out of Greg's reach in a couple of days. Knock them off and you're on your own. You're gonna make a lot of money after that. A lot of money, Seth. Just don't fuck it up now 'cause you're pissed at Greg. Got it?
SETH=>Yeah Chris. I got it.
CHRIS=>You're a good kid. Too fucking smart though.
SETH=>Hey, how you doing?
JANITOR=>Fine, thanks.
SETH=>I'm trying to find the space that our company just rented.
JANITOR=>What's the name of the company? We've only rented out a couple of offices.
SETH=>JT Marlin.
JAMES=>Nope. No company by that name. You sure you got the right building?
SETH=>Yeah. Michael Brantley told me to come by.
JANITOR=>Michael. Big guy, maybe thirty years old? Sharp dresser?
SETH=>Yeah, that's him.
JANITOR=>Second floor. Suite 206. You can go up and have a look.
SETH=>It's not locked.
JAMES=>Nah. Just cheap phones in there, that's all.
MICHAEL=>Now if the heat does come and we have to jump, how long will it take to move the whole firm? I mean everything.
JOHN=>Under two hours, literally. They'll be making calls that afternoon.
MARTY=>So what do you think of the suit?
SETH=>You're asking me?
MARTY=>Sure. You've got good taste in clothing.
SETH=>Actually I like it a lot. I noticed it earlier. Real departure for you though.
MARTY=>Not the usual stodgy old judge garb huh?
SETH=>No. You even nailed the tie.
MARTY=>Even? Are you going to start investing my money soon? I could use a better return than Fidelity's getting me.
SETH=>I don't know if I'm ready for that. Too much pressure. Imagine if I lost your retirement fund on some small-cap stock. God, that would be funny.
MARTY=>Yeah, hysterical.
MARTY=>So what kind of stocks are you trading these days?
SETH=>Mostly tech and pharmaceuticals.
MARTY=>You got any tips for me?
SETH=>Dad. I didn't know you had it in you.
MARTY=>What? I never said I didn't like to make money. It's the method I've always been concerned about.
MARTY=>See Seth, we're having lunch here like real people. I told you we could get to this.
SETH=>You did.
DEBBIE=>JT Marlin, how may I direct your call?
TRUE=>I think I'll just talk to you.
DEBBIE=>Why are you calling me here? I told you I would talk to you as soon as I knew.
TRUE=>Time's running out, Deb. I need to know what he's doing. Serve him up.
DEBBIE=>He hasn't done anything wrong. There' nothing I can tell you. Why don't you go after Feinstein or one of the other guys? Seth's a good kid.
TRUE=>We want to nail those other guys. We're not interested in putting Seth away. So if you care about him so much then you better find something on him. Your immunity deal won't be on the table forever. I'm just thinking about your mother that's all. One of us has to.
SETH=>The only problem you're going to have is that I didn't come down there an twist your arm to buy a thousand shares. You simply have no idea what you've tapped into here today. That's right. My secretary will take all your information. I have to hop. Bye.
SETH=>Make it so, Sheryl. Yes! Finally! My first whale and my first account. My book baby!
GREG=>Hey Seth, hate to bust in on your little victory speech, but that's your fortieth account.
SETH=>Right. So it's mine. I'm out of the junior broker program. I don't work for you No Mo'!
GREG=>Well you're out, but that account's mine.
SETH=>Fuck that. I keep the fortieth.
GREG=>No you don't.
SETH=>Is this about Debbie? Are you that bitter? I have made you a lot of money over the last three months, more than any other trainee.
GREG=>Sorry Seth. I couldn't do it if I wanted to. It's the rules.
CHRIS=>Hey, come on, Greg. You can bend the rules. I gave my guys...
GREG=>Get the fuck out of here, Chris.
CHRIS=>Not yourself these days, man. Not yourself.
SETH=>Fuck you, Greg.
GREG=>You're on my team, I'm not on yours. Try to remember that bitch.
SETH=>Dad?
MARTY=>I spoke to Howard Goldberg over at Prudential. You lied again you unbelievable piece... You lied to all of us. He told me all about JT Marlin. A chop shop. You've been selling their shit all this time. How many people have you fucked over so far, Seth? Huh? How many?
MARTY=>All that bullshit about them wanting to know you how the business works. The great training program. Profits you've heard for your customers! Did you make them anything? Just tell me, did you make them any money?
SETH=>No. Not a penny.
MARTY=>I'm done with you, Seth. This is it. You're out of our lives. I don't want to see you again. Don't come by the house, don't call. This is worse than the casino. You've been stealing here.
SETH=>I was gonna tell you, Dad. I was just waiting for the right time.
SETH=>Dad!
HARRY=>You think I want to live in this apartment the rest of my life?!
SUSAN=>Sometimes I wonder.
HARRY=>Oh please! I'm the one who got the raise, Susan, try and remember that. I'm the one that goes out every day and supports this family.
SUSAN=>You can't keep using that shit, Harry. I've told you a million times I have no problem going out and getting a job to help pitch in, but you forbid it. Then you go and use it against me.
HARRY=>Look Susan, we're going to buy the house. I promise. We will get the house. Just get off my back!
DIRECTOR=>Listen to me. I want him brought in here. You've already got a strong case. He'll turn states.
TRUE=>What do we have on him? Manipulative trading tactics? What can we threaten him with, license revocation? He'll never go for it. We need more. I know he's up to something. I can feel it.
DIRECTOR=>I can't afford to leave him out there any longer. This girlfriend of his may have already tipped him off. He could run at any time.
TRUE=>She hasn't, sir.
DIRECTOR=>How could you possibly know that? And if you're right, and she's so loyal to you, then why hasn't she given us any information yet? I want Davis brought in by the end of the week. Period.
TRUE=>Fine.
WOMAN=>How many words can you type a minute?
MARTY=>What are you doing here? I thought I told you I didn't want to see you again.
SETH=>I need to talk to you.
MARTY=>Get out.
SETH=>Dad, I really need to talk.
MARTY=>What is it?!
SETH=>I want out of the firm.
MARTY=>Great. So leave. I don't really care what you do anymore. But your coming here is unacceptable. You want to cost me my judgeship? I can't have any connection to you.
SETH=>You know how you asked me to invest for you? Well I've got something. It's a sure thing.
MARTY=>You've got to be kidding me, Seth. Get out.
SETH=>I'm talking about making you half a million on the next new issue. And it's safe.
MARTY=>Seth, listen.
SETH=>I play you off as a whale by having you go in on a couple of big trades that JT Marlin tells you to invest in. You know, prove your loyalty. Figure you'll drop $50,000.
MARTY=>Are you fucking nuts?
SETH=>Just listen to me. After you drop the fifty they'll have faith in you as a customer. When the next IPO comes out you'll get a huge chunk for being so loyal. Then instead of holding onto it until Michael can sell off all of the common stock, you dump it the same day. We'll make a fortune and the stock will immediately collapse. That should raise enough red flags for the SEC to come in and close shop within a week. We walk rich and JT goes down.
MARTY=>I can't believe we're having this conversation.
SETH=>This is the way I want to get out.
MARTY=>Tough shit, Seth! You better walk right now before you're the one the SEC comes after.
SETH=>But this way I can leave and give them a taste of their own medicine.
MARTY=>I don't understand you. I really don't. You think I'm going to help you commit a crime?
SETH=>A crime? You don't like these people any more than I do. The whole firm is crooked. We're serving justice. And who are we committing a crime against?
MARTY=>This is bullshit rhetoric. What's this all about? Do I have to play on your terms? An act of faith? Is that it?
SETH=>I just wanted to do this with someone I trusted, that's all. I'm getting out like you told me to.
MARTY=>I can't do it, Seth. It's illegal!
SETH=>You remember this day?
MARTY=>Of course. I bought you that bike.
SETH=>Do you remember what happened about a month after this?
MARTY=>What do you want from me, Seth?
SETH=>Do you remember when I broke my leg?
MARTY=>Of course I remember! You were hysterical. I had to get you to stop.
SETH=>Hysterical? You mean like you are right now? I wasn't even crying, Dad.
MARTY=>Get out of here.
SETH=>Sorry I couldn't get the job you wanted me to have. But you know what, who gives a shit? I'm good at what I do. The casino was a business!! A legitimate business! And I ran it pretty fucking well, Dad. To think I closed it for you.
MARTY=>You closed it?
SETH=>Then I went after this job because I thought it was what you wanted me to be doing. I didn't know they were a fucking chop-shop when I went there. It's like I can't get away from it. But I tried to make the changes you told me to. I did everything you said. I'm leaving JT now. I'm just asking you to do this one thing with me. Just this one last thing.
MARTY=>I'm sorry, Seth. I can't do it.
SETH=>Fine, I'll find someone else.
DEBBIE=>What are you gonna do now?
SETH=>I'm still gonna do it. I have this friend who may go in with me. Till then I'm gonna make as much money as I can at the firm. I don't care who gets fucked anymore. My father can go to hell!
DEBBIE=>Seth please, my mom.
SETH=>Sorry.
DEBBIE=>I don't think this is a good idea. Why don't you just quit?
SETH=>No. I told you. I've invested too much time. And I have no fucking money coming in anymore because Jeff tanked my gold mine. I need this.
DEBBIE=>How about finding a position at a real brokerage house? You're a great broker now. I'm sure you could easily get a job.
SETH=>Doing what? Ticket running? Coming from JT Marlin you think they're going to let me trade for them? There's no way.
SETH=>Why are you so against this anyway? What do you care if I pull this off? It'll be great for both of us.
DEBBIE=>I just have a bad feeling about it.
SETH=>You know what, I gotta go.
DEBBIE=>Where are you going? Seth, wait. I need to talk to...
SETH=>I have to go figure this all out.
DEBBIE=>Seth.
DEBBIE=>Baby, I'm so sorry. I need to tell you something I've been keeping in for...
TRUE=>Why don't you do that. Why don't you tell me something.
DEBBIE=>Be quiet, my mother's finally sleeping.
TRUE=>What's he doing?
DEBBIE=>Nothing. He's doing nothing. But I found out how Michael operates the whole thing. Let me give you that.
TRUE=>Honestly, you're a shitty witness. Black secretaries are not as credible as white stock brokers. It's a fucked up legal system. We need Seth to testify, not you. Now what the fuck is he up to?
DEBBIE=>He hasn't said a word to me.
TRUE=>You're a smart girl, Debbie. Why are you doing this to me?
DEBBIE=>What?
TRUE=>Normally, we could play this game for a bit, but this is just such a bad time to fuck with me!
DEBBIE=>What do you want me to tell you?
TRUE=>You want me to go wake Mom? Maybe if we all sit down and talk about things we can figure out a way to have someone come and give her her medication while you're upstate.
DEBBIE=>Fuck you.
TRUE=>Give him up!!
DEBBIE=>Alright.
TRUE=>Go ahead! What's he doing?
MOTHER=>Debbie, are you okay?
TRUE=>Are you?
DEBBIE=>He's going in with a friend on an IPO scam this week. It's on the new issue. I better get immunity you piece of shit.
TRUE=>Keep talking to me like that. That's your best bet.
SUSAN=>I'll get it.
HARRY=>No! I mean, I'll get it.
ADAM=>You do not look like you are fucking around today.
SETH=>That is because I am not fucking around. I am making bank today and I do not care who the fuck I take it from.
HARRY=>Hello?
SETH=>Hi Harry.
HARRY=>Seth! Did you get my calls?
SETH=>Yes Harry, it's just been crazy here.
HARRY=>What the hell's happening with Farrow Tech, it's dropped five points since I bought it. I wanna sell.
SETH=>Sell now? The stock is down! You don't make money in the market buying high and selling low, Harry.
HARRY=>So what's going on? Tell me why we shouldn't just get out now.
SETH=>Alright, here's the deal. I told you things would happen within sixty days, it's only twenty so far, but the situation here is explosive and I wanted to get you involved. That's why I haven't returned any calls. I've been gathering information all morning. So here it is: The stock's down for tech reasons. It's been on the restricted list all week. But it's the same company. As a matter of fact, while it was on the restricted list, Farrow was doing nothing but signing more contracts. I'm telling you it's looking like our next big one here. Hold on a second, Harry.
JIM=>Just got word from Michael. The rip on Farrow Tech is now three dollars.
SETH=>Listen to this, Harry.
HARRY=>Jesus Christ, what's going on over there?
SETH=>See what I'm saying? People know. The place is going nuts. It's already up a point and its just coming off the restricted list. I'm advising all my clients to get in on this, and heavy. Hold on a second, let me close the door to my office.
SETH=>Alright, now you get the same stock that we picked up at eight, only now it's at four. Now, when it was at eight I told you it was going to twenty, right?
HARRY=>You did.
SETH=>Right, and it's still going there, probably even higher now. This doesn't change anything except that you're going to make more money than you did before. Look Harry, I liked it at eight, I love it at four. It's an average down for you.
HARRY=>What?
SETH=>Dollar cost averaging. If you own a hundred shares at ten dollars and now you buy another one hundred at five, that's a F200 shares at $7.50 a share. Your cost basis is lower. Now if I get you involved at ten and take you out at fifteen, you've made how many points Harry?
HARRY=>Five.
SETH=>Exactly. But if I get you involved at seven and a half and I take you out at fifteen, well that's seven and a half points, that's even better.
HARRY=>I don't know.
SETH=>I also have a bullet on it. A couple of days ago Dan Dorfman, on CNBC, put a heavy buy recommendation on Farrow Tech. Reason being, he's been in contact with the CEO of the company and they feel FDA approval will happen in the next three or four weeks. Listen to me. Off the record, I just called a broker friend of mine at another firm and had him pick me up fifty thousand shares under my sister- in-law's name. I'm going to put all my kids through college with this stock. Look, I have a thousand more phone calls to make, Harry. I have to call every one of my clients and give them this same opportunity. Remember when we first spoke? I told you that this firm only had five or six great ideas a year! Well, Harry, this is one of those ideas.
SETH=>I remember you saying something about buying a house, right?
HARRY=>Yeah.
SETH=>Well, how'd you like to pay for it tomorrow... in cash?
HARRY=>You're serious.
SETH=>Serious as cancer.
HARRY=>All I've got is the fifty thousand from our savings.
SHERYL=>Seth, you've got a call on line three.
SETH=>That's my secretary. I gotta go. I have a lot of clients I need to make money for today. What's it gonna be, Harry?
SETH=>I thought you were coming over tonight?
DEBBIE=>I can't make it. I'm not feeling well.
SETH=>Come over. I'll take care of you.
DEBBIE=>No. I'm going to just stay here.
SETH=>Alright, then I'll come over there. I'll bring you some soup.
DEBBIE=>No. Don't. Mom's not doing too well either.
SETH=>Oh shit. I'm sorry.
DEBBIE=>It's stressing me out a bit. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
MOTHER=>I know, Seth. But you really went too far this time. I thought we were past the lying. Well then when you figured it out you should have said something. I understand that. It's trues, he definitely hasn't helped any.
MOTHER=>Of course he's upset. You guys are going to work through it though. I'm sure of it. He loves you, Seth. Do you know that? It's important that you know that. Okay. Bye.
GREG=>We're not fucking around today, guys. I'm sure you all know that we're going to be getting a lot of heat for what Farrow Tech did yesterday, so be smart on the phone. Calm them down. I don't want people dumping their shares.
SHERYL=>Adam! I got a Mr. Klastow, he's super hot.
ADAM=>Mr. Klastow?
ADAM=>Right. I understand. Right. I'm sorry. We couldn't foresee this when we... Right. Okay. I'll do it right now.
GREG=>What the fuck is this? You think I'm gonna sign a sell ticket for you? What did I just say?
GREG=>Call him back and explain the situation to him! No one's gonna unload today, no one!
SHERYL=>Seth. Line three.
SETH=>Seth Davis here.
MARTY=>Hi Seth, how are you?
SETH=>Dad!
MARTY=>Can I change your mind about doing this IPO scheme?
SETH=>No. I'm sorry. I already found someone who's going in with me.
MARTY=>Well then I'm going to help you out with it.
SETH=>You're gonna do it with me?!
MARTY=>No, I can't do it, Seth, but I want to at least make sure you don't get caught. I have someone I know over at the Parthenon Group that will talk to you about it. Come over to the house tonight.
SETH=>Thanks, Dad. I'm so glad you called.
MARTY=>Yeah. Bye.
SHERYL=>Seth, I've got a Harry Reynard on the phone.
SETH=>Pass him on. Harry, I was going to call you today.
HARRY=>I want my money back.
SETH=>Look, I know you're pissed, Harry, they had a setback. But don't worry about it, it's become a goal stock. I plan to bring you eight or nine points over the course of this year. People are talking about it like it's the next Microsoft.
HARRY=>Listen Seth, I'm in a heap of trouble here. I need that money back. I was supposed to use it for a down payment on a house for my family. We're going to lose the house now.
SETH=>Harry, listen, it's going to rebound.
HARRY=>Seth!! I need the money back!!!
SETH=>I'm sorry. I can't do that. I have to go.
SETH=>If he calls back, I'm not here.
SUPERVISOR=>Harry, do you have that status report ready?
HARRY=>Yes Michelle. I'll bring it right over.
SUPERVISOR=>I also wanted to ask you about...
SHERYL=>JT Marlin.
HARRY=>I'll talk to you after I finish with this call.
SUSAN=>OOOkay.
HARRY=>Seth Davis.
SHERYL=>May I ask who's calling.
HARRY=>It's Harry Reynard!
SHERYL=>I'm sorry, Mr. Reynard, but Mr. Davis just stepped out for a meeting.
HARRY=>God... ...Damn it!!
SETH=>Are you gonna talk to me?
DEBBIE=>I don't know what to tell you, Seth. I mean think about it. If you pull off this IPO deal and I'm associated with you, what do you think is gonna happen do me?
SETH=>They won't be able to prove anything.
DEBBIE=>Who says they have to? I'm gonna lose my job unless I put some distance between us now.
SETH=>What's wrong?
TRUE=>Seth Davis, you're under arrest for the violation of 26 SEC and NASD regulations.
DEBBIE=>What are you doing? What's this all about? Seth, I'll get you out of this.
SETH=>Just don't call my father.
TRUE=>Sit down, Debbie.
SUSAN=>How could you be so stupid!?
SUSAN=>What were you thinking, Harry? The kids, the house, our future!!
HARRY=>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
SETH=>Why did you bring him in? He didn't do anything!
MARTY=>What the fuck is going on, Seth? Did you talk to them about me?
SETH=>What??!! Of course not. Why is he here!?
MARTY=>You sure, Seth?
SETH=>Of course I'm sure. Not a word.
MARTY=>That's it. I'm walking out of here in three seconds unless you charge me with something.
MARTY=>Can I change your mind about doing this IPO scheme?... Then I'm going to help you out with it... I want to at least make sure you don't get caught.
MARTY=>Jesus Christ.
SETH=>So what do you want from me?
TRUE=>We want you to testify.
SETH=>No whit. What are you offering?
TRUE=>Full immunity.
SETH=>What about my father?
TRUE=>He won't do any time.
MARTY=>I haven't done anything illegal, Seth.
SETH=>So what's the deal.
MARTY=>I lose my judgeship just going along for the ride.
TRUE=>I've got nothing to do with that.
MARTY=>Sure you do. You're gonna release that tape to the press. Makes your case so much more glamorous with the involvement of a Federal judge.
SETH=>No deal.
TRUE=>What?
SETH=>Take my father out the back door right now and bring him home. He has nothing to do with this case at all. If his name shows up in one newspaper, I don't testify. And I mean that. For me, it'd be worth going to jail for.
TRUE=>You're serious?
SETH=>What do you think?
TRUE=>I think you're nuts. You want to do it that way? Fine. Then no immunity for you, pal. I need one of you to face the music.
MARTY=>Seth, don't be stupid. He's right. I won't see a day in jail. They'll get you for at least four years.
SETH=>I don't care. Go home, Dad.
TRUE=>Alright, alright, alright. Before we start dealing here, just what are you offering?
SETH=>I'm gonna hand you this case on a silver fucking platter. I know everything you don't. I know how it all works. How Michael makes his money, where it goes, and who's getting it. Now what happens tomorrow?
TRUE=>You go back to work tomorrow like nothing happened. Just for one day. I need your client book and your whole C- drive backed up onto floppy. But don't get any stupid inclinations to travel abroad. We know where your father lives. You're going away, kid.
SETH=>Yeah. You mentioned that earlier.
TRUE=>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you little fuck.
MARTY=>Give me a couple of minutes with him, would you?
SETH=>I'm sorry, Dad. I am so fucking sorry. I didn't mean to do this to you.
MARTY=>Shhhh. Let me speak.
MARTY=>When I came up to you behind that car, it was the hardest thing I ever had to bear. I just wanted to make your pain disappear. I don't even know how to describe the feeling. But I want you to know something.
MARTY=>Not a single day of my life has gone by where I do not think about that moment, where I do not dream I was there for one more chance. If I could take back just one thing in my life, Seth, do one thing over... I am more sorry than you will ever know.
SHERYL=>Seth, line two.
SETH=>Hello?
TRUE=>Get going.
SETH=>I'm going to lunch, boys.
TABLE=>See you, Seth.
DEBBIE=>Seth?
HARRY=>Thank you so much.
SETH=>No problem.
