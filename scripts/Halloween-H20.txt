PAMELA=>Shit...
JIMMY=>Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
PAMELA=>My blood pleasure. You scared the hell out of me.
JIMMY=>Oh. Sorry. I'm on my way to the ring and --
PAMELA=>I think someone broke into my house.
JIMMY=>No shit?!
PAMELA=>No shit.
JIMMY=>3037 Keystone.. yeah... gotcha.
JIMMY=>Said to give 'em fifteen minutes. They'll send someone by.
PAMELA=>Jimmy, what are you doing?
JIMMY=>Checking out your place.
PAMELA=>No. Wait for the police.
JIMMY=>And miss the big game? No way.
JIMMY=>Hey, man, don't mess with me! I'll knock your head clean off your body!
JIMMY=>Oh, shit...
PAMELA=>Come on, damn it...
JIMMY=>Nothing to fear. The coast is clear.
PAMELA=>You sure?
JIMMY=>Totally. I checked all the rooms and closets...
PAMELA=>Nothing's missing?
JIMMY=>Don't think so. But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
PAMELA=>My office?
JIMMY=>Yeah. Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
PAMELA=>Christ, Jimmy... didn't you try the goddamn lights?!
PAMELA=>Shit.
PAMELA=>Jimmy! You still there?!
PAMELA=>Goddamnit, Jimmy! Someone's still in my house!
PAMELA=>HELP! GODDAMNIT IT! OVER HERE! GOD PLEASE!
PAMELA=>Stay the fuck away from me!
KERI=>Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
JOHN=>You're so predictable.
JOHN=>What the --
KERI=>Betcha' didn't predict that.
JOHN=>I'm sixteen, Keri. I should be able to live wherever I want.
KERI=>And I should have a son who calls me "Mom". Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
JOHN=>Okay, you win. I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
KERI=>No.
JOHN=>Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
KERI=>You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top. Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
JOHN=>I promise not to run off to Cancun.
KERI=>Forget it.
JOHN=>The dorms are only fifty feet away. You could practically see into my window. So, what difference does it make?
KERI=>My point exactly. See, we both agree.
JOHN=>Alright, I was wrong. There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
KERI=>I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
JOHN=>My life is a living hell.
KERI=>It's not, trust me.
KERI=>Where are you going?
JOHN=>To the bathroom. Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
KERI=>I thought you'd never ask.
JOHN=>You're twisted.
KERI=>I know.
KERI=>Wally, you've been under that hood for months. Why don't we just call a mechanic?
WALLY=>Miss Tate, I serviced B-1 Bombers in W-W-2. This here is child's play.
KERI=>So you're saying I should call a child to come give you a hand?
WALLY=>I'm saying she'll be purring like a kitten before you know it.
KERI=>There's your problem, Walter. You don't want it to purr, you want it to start.
WALLY=>And she will, Miss Tate. She will.
WALLY=>Mmmm-mmm. If they had teachers like you when I was a boy, I'd be a rocket scientist.
KERI=>Good morning, Hattie.
HATTIE=>Went into town. Had that duplicate key made.
KERI=>Thank you.
HATTIE=>Thank me with two bucks.
KERI=>Oh... right.
HATTIE=>Just what I wanted... more change.
HATTIE=>And next time you lose a gate key, young lady, you'll be climbing your way out of here.
KERI=>I'll be more careful next time.
CARTER=>Detective Richard Carter, Haddonfield P.D. Detective Blake called my office...
OFFICER=>Go on in. She's been waiting for you.
OFFICER=>You might need this...
OFFICER=>Some serious shit in there, Detective.
VOICE=>Double homicide.
BLAKE=>Her name's Pamela Whittington, next door neighbor to victim number two... James Howell.
CARTER=>Let me guess... he's the guy with the hockey skate for a nose ring.
CARTER=>No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
BLAKE=>It's for your cigarette. I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
CARTER=>Why am I here?
BLAKE=>They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
CARTER=>With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
BLAKE=>Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis. Her home office was ransacked. It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers. It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
CARTER=>Well, when you put it that way.
BLAKE=>Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation?
CARTER=>I like a woman who takes control.
BLAKE=>Pamela entered the house and walked into the den where she discovers James Howell's body...
BLAKE=>Shaken, she returns to the front door to find the hutch blocking her exit...
BLAKE=>She runs to the kitchen, where she is ambushed at the back door by the killer.
CARTER=>One set of muddy shoe prints.
BLAKE=>That don't match either of the victim's.
CARTER=>She grabs a knife from the butcher block.
BLAKE=>Heads to the living room...
CARTER=>Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
BLAKE=>Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
CARTER=>No blood on the knife.
CARTER=>The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
BLAKE=>Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
CARTER=>As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
BLAKE=>Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
CARTER=>Impressive, Blake. Where'd you learn how to do that?
BLAKE=>Girl scouts.
LINDA=>You aced it, didn't you?
MOLLY=>I did alright.
LINDA=>Fuckin' A.
MOLLY=>He gave me a fuckin' A? Wow.
AMY=>These lockers are totally girl unfriendly.
MOLLY=>Break another nail?
AMY=>Pointer finger. And the dance is in two days...
LINDA=>Life's a bitch.
AMY=>Eddie's working late at Freeman's tonight... all alone.
MOLLY=>I thought Eddie left for N.Y.U.?
AMY=>Guess he couldn't tear himself away from me.
LINDA=>Guess he couldn't pass admissions.
AMY=>Shut up, pinhead.
JOHN=>There you are. You tell 'em about tonight?
AMY=>I just got here.
MOLLY=>What's this?
LINDA=>You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
JOHN=>Shelve the barf bag. It's the key to the main gate.
MOLLY=>Where'd you get it?
JOHN=>Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
MOLLY=>You stole it?
JOHN=>I borrowed it.
AMY=>Party at Freeman's tonight.
LINDA=>I am in need of some serious partying.
MOLLY=>Not me.
JOHN=>Why not?
MOLLY=>I can't afford to get caught.
LINDA=>Molly, you're the resident assistant. What are you gonna do, narc on yourself?
JOHN=>Just meet me in front of the gate after lights out.
MOLLY=>Wait... John...
WILL=>What a sight for sore eyes...
WILL=>... and ears...
WILL=>...and lips...
KERI=>Will...
WILL=>What? They've all taken sex ed.
KERI=>And this isn't the place for a live demonstration.
WILL=>Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
KERI=>Looks great. It does.
WILL=>You okay? You seem a little off.
KERI=>Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
KERI=>That one always goes over big at the AA meetings.
WILL=>It's John, isn't it?
KERI=>It's always John.
WILL=>Still wants to move out?
KERI=>He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
WILL=>This kid just wants his freedom.
KERI=>It's not going to happen.
WILL=>The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
KERI=>Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
WILL=>Doesn't make it bad advice.
WILL=>God I love that smile.
KERI=>I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark. Need anything?
WILL=>A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
KERI=>Bye Will.
CASHIER=>Happy Halloween.
KERI=>I hate this fucking holiday...
CARTER=>Carter.
BLAKE=>It's Blake. Meet me at Grand View.
CARTER=>Where?
BLAKE=>The cemetery...
CARTER=>Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
EDDIE=>Pretty wicked, huh?
LINDA=>I think it's twisted.
EDDIE=>This coming from the girl with a stake through her tongue.
LINDA=>You're glorifying the big creep.
SHANE=>Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
EDDIE=>What the fuck are you talking about?
SHANE=>Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver. It was a butcher knife.
EDDIE=>Who are you, the serial killer police? What difference does it make?
SHANE=>It's not historically accurate, that's all.
AMY=>He could be holding a swizzle stick, it still gives me the willies.
JOHN=>Don't worry... I hear he only kills virgins.
SHANE=>Another historical inaccuracy.
EDDIE=>Would somebody shut this guy up?
MOLLY=>Come on, we better get back before Mrs. Sullivan makes her rounds.
LINDA=>Oh, shit. Molly's right. It's eleven-thirty.
AMY=>You guys go on. Eddie's gonna take me back after he closes up.
JOHN=>Condoms are on aisle four...
EDDIE=>Out.
AMY=>How do you like the color? It's called "Bloodshed Red."
EDDIE=>Yeah, yeah... looks good...
EDDIE=>Let's go in back and check out the "inventory."
AMY=>Mmmmm, sounds good.
EDDIE=>Shit. Can't people read? Don't move. I'll be right back.
EDDIE=>Hey, we're closed!
EDDIE=>Shit!
EDDIE=>What the hell...
AMY=>Eddie?
AMY=>Damnit, Eddie! Stop fooling around.
AMY=>If you think you're gettin' any after this, you're dead wrong.
CARTER=>You take all your dates here. Blake?
BLAKE=>Only the real stiffs.
CARTER=>I can be real stiff.
BLAKE=>Charming.
FRED=>Hey! Watch my geraniums.
FRED=>Beautiful, aren't they? Rotting corpses make the best fertilizer, ya' know. Especially those Irish folk. They push up the daises like a son-of-a-bitch...
CARTER=>I'll remember that.
FRED=>Hell, I can tell you where every Mick is buried by the ground cover growing above 'em.
FRED=>Irish... ...Irish...
FRED=>Never could get anything to grow cover this one...
BLAKE=>And you're sure this is Laurie Strode's grave?
FRED=>Sure as I'm standing here.
FRED=>Buried her daughter right next to her not too long ago. You don't suppose that Meyers fella took the tombstone?
CARTER=>Probably just a couple of kids playing a Halloween prank.
BLAKE=>Tee-peeing a house, yes. A bag of burning shit on a porch, maybe. Digging up tombstone? I don't think so.
CARTER=>I'm going to bed.
BLAKE=>That's it?
CARTER=>Care to join me?
BLAKE=>Come on, Carter. You know it's Michael.
CARTER=>What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
BLAKE=>Yes.
CARTER=>Sweet dreams, Blake.
KERI=>Shit, John! What the hell were you doing out there?!
JOHN=>Nothing.
KERI=>You're kidding with that answer, right?
JOHN=>I just went for a walk. It's no big deal.
KERI=>Wrong. There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
JOHN=>Or what? You're gonna shoot me?
KERI=>It's an option.
JOHN=>Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
KERI=>Oh, so now it's my fault?
JOHN=>Just forget it...
KERI=>I'm sure Mr. Elliot will go over this when he returns on Monday, but Julie hit on a very important aspect of Virgil's "The Aeniad."
KERI=>F-A-T-E. Fate. The Romans believed in the three goddesses of Fate, called "the Fate." Nona, Decuma, and Morta. These goddesses determined your fate. They were to blame when things went wrong, and were to be praised when --
WILL=>Whoa... what's the hurry? I'm not going anywhere...
WILL=>Hey, you alright?
KERI=>What?
WILL=>What are you looking at?
KERI=>I'm fine. I just need to lie down...
SECRETARY=>Hillcrest Academy, may I help you?
CARTER=>Carter.
BLAKE=>It's Blake. How do you feel about Wisconsin?
LINDA=>Look, they're staring right at us.
SHANE=>You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
JOHN=>Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
MOLLY=>Is that all you guys can think about? Amy never came back last night. Maybe she's in trouble.
LINDA=>Better her than me.
MOLLY=>You're unbelievable.
SHANE=>Linda's right. I have Yale to think about. Amy's going to the Barbizon School of Beauty -- if they let her retake her boards...
KERI=>Bruce... what's going on? The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
DEPUTY CLARK=>Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown. We got a dead body in there.
KERI=>A dead body?
DEPUTY CLARK=>It's Amy Kramer.
KERI=>My god...
DEPUTY CLARK=>Pretty messy. Parents have already been notified. Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
KERI=>Do you know who did this?
DEPUTY CLARK=>Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
KERI=>Think Eddie had something to do with it?
DEPUTY CLARK=>Doesn't look good.
DEPUTY CLARK=>You best keep those students locked behind those gates of yours... got ourselves a cold-blooded killer on the loose.
HATTIE=>Who's there?
HATTIE=>Please identify yourself, young man.
HATTIE=>My Lord...
HATTIE=>Hello?
MOLLY=>What are you doing here?!
JOHN=>I came to see you.
MOLLY=>I can see that. Why?
JOHN=>Can I come in?
MOLLY=>Are you crazy? You'll get caught.
JOHN=>Then you come out here.
MOLLY=>Then I'll get caught.
JOHN=>Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
MOLLY=>Alright. I'll come out. Just be quiet.
MOLLY=>You really think Eddie killed her?
JOHN=>You saw that Michael Meyers display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
MOLLY=>I guess. It's just hard to believe.
JOHN=>You look kind of cold.
MOLLY=>I'm okay.
JOHN=>Here, take my jacket.
JOHN=>Better?
MOLLY=>Yeah.
KERI=>All right... fun's over.
KERI=>Go take a cold shower... I'll deal with you later.
KERI=>Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
MOLLY=>I know. I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate. Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
KERI=>Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
MOLLY=>Okay... thank you.
KERI=>Something tells me I won't get the same reaction when I tell John...
MOLLY=>I feel like everyone's staring at me.
SARAH=>News travels fast. It's all over school about you and John getting busted in the woods by Miss Tate.
LINDA=>Don't suppose you had anything to do with that, motor mouth.
SARAH=>Shut up, freak.
MRS. ROCKWELL=>Alright, I know you girls have the big Halloween dance tonight, so I'm letting you go ten minutes early today.
LINDA=>How generous of her.
MRS. ROCKWELL=>Sarah, since you took it upon yourself to arrive ten minutes late today, you can stay the extra ten minutes.
SARAH=>But Mrs. Rockwell...
MRS. ROCKWELL=>Use the time to practice your drive. You looked real sloppy out there today.
LINDA=>Ooooh, busted.
MOLLY=>Big time. And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
SARAH=>Smile at the birdie, ladies.
LINDA=>Sarah Locke. What a major bitch. You know she waxes her stomach?
SARAH=>Hey! There's someone in here!
SARAH=>Hell-o! I'm in here!
KERI=>Hattie?
KERI=>Now where is she?
KERI=>Shit!
CARTER=>I'll be damned.
KERI=>Do I know you?
BLAKE=>We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
CARTER=>The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
KERI=>I can see that. Who are you?
CARTER=>Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
BLAKE=>Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
CARTER=>Mind if we sit down?
KERI=>I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy.
CARTER=>Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
KERI=>Detective...
CARTER=>Carter.
KERI=>... I think it would be best if you both left.
CARTER=>Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
KERI=>I never stop thinking about it, Detective. The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
CARTER=>Funny, we just drove right in.
KERI=>Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again. Thanks for your concern. Goodbye.
CARTER=>Has anyone ever told you, you bear a striking resemblance to Laurie Strode?
KERI=>Never heard of her.
BLAKE=>The Ferndale P.D. is setting up a roadblock couple miles down the road. They think they're looking for a jealous boyfriend gone mad... I think differently. We can protect you..
KERI=>You can't stop him.
CARTER=>Not without some help.
CARTER=>Don't be a stranger...
LINDA=>Shane's going as a condom.
MOLLY=>I thought you were allergic to latex.
LINDA=>I'll pop a Benadryl.
MOLLY=>You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
LINDA=>Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
KERI=>Whoa. What's going on in there?
MOLLY=>Linda! He killed Linda!
KERI=>Who?!
MOLLY=>Michael Meyers!
MOLLY=>Miss Tate, wait!
KERI=>Michael, nooooooo!
JOHN=>That was classic... "Michael, nooooooo!"
LINDA=>Mmmm. Anyone got some French fries?
LINDA=>Molly, you should have seen your face...
KERI=>Home... NOW!
JOHN=>I'm sorry, alright? It was just a stupid joke.
KERI=>Will, sit down...
KERI=>There's something I have to tell you both. It's going to sound strange...
WILL=>What?
KERI=>My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode.
WILL=>You're right. It does sound strange.
JOHN=>You some kind of fugitive or something?
KERI=>I was trying to get away from someone.
WILL=>Who?
KERI=>Michael Meyers.
WILL=>The serial killer?
KERI=>He's my brother.
JOHN=>Now you're joking, right?
KERI=>Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
WILL=>Keri, have you been...
KERI=>No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking. It's the truth.
WILL=>I can't believe this is happening.
KERI=>Shit happens.
JOHN=>Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
KERI=>Yes.
JOHN=>Any other psychotic relatives I should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger?
KERI=>No.
JOHN=>Why didn't you tell me?
KERI=>I was trying to protect you from this...
KERI=>Where are you going?
JOHN=>I don't know.
WILL=>You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
KERI=>Are you going to leave, too?
WILL=>Never.
WILL=>So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
KERI=>Yeah.
WILL=>Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
DEPUTY CLARK=>Don't worry, Detective. No one's getting up to that school.
CARTER=>And this is the only way up to Hillcrest?
DEPUTY CLARK=>Sure is. Unless your boy can fly.
CARTER=>I hope not.
WALLY=>Hey, you kids! Knock that off! Get over here!
WALLY=>Damn kids.
LINDA=>BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
MOLLY=>Shit, Linda!
LINDA=>You're so easy...
MOLLY=>Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
LINDA=>Nope. Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
MOLLY=>Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
LINDA=>Thanks!
MOLLY=>Where's Shane?
LINDA=>Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
MOLLY=>But the dance is in the gymnasium.
LINDA=>Very insightful.
LINDA=>Let the party begin.
MOLLY=>Have enough fun for the both of us.
LINDA=>Oh, don't be such a victim.
LINDA=>Here. Drink a couple of these. It'll putcha in a much better mood. Ta-ta.
MOLLY=>Guess it's just you and me, boy.
MOLLY=>Just some idiot in a costume...
MOLLY=>Let the party begin.
LINDA=>Wait.
SHANE=>What is it?
LINDA=>I have to pee.
SHANE=>Can't you hold it?
LINDA=>Can't you?
LINDA=>Somebody in there?
LINDA=>Hellooooo.
LINDA=>IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY. AND YOU WANT MY BODY. COME ON, BABY. LET ME KNOW.
LINDA=>Shane?
WILL=>May I offer you some fresh blood? I squeezed it myself.
KERI=>Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
WILL=>Oh, right. Sorry.
KERI=>I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
WILL=>Can't it wait till Monday? I thought maybe we could dance... I'm very light of my feet.
KERI=>Thanks, but I'm not much in the mood for dancing. Enjoy the party... you did a great job.
MOLLY=>Whatcha growling at, huh?
MOLLY=>Lurch, there's nothing in there but clothes.
MOLLY=>Guess there's always next year... if I live past the humiliation of tonight.
MOLLY=>Oh, God...
MOLLY=>Let me in! Oh, God, help me! Somebody... goddamnit!
KERI=>Molly?
KERI=>NOOOOOOOOO!
KERI=>John...
KERI=>John!
JOHN=>He found you, didn't he?
KERI=>Get on the bus.
JOHN=>Where's Molly? She's not in her room...
KERI=>Just get on the bus.
JOHN=>I'm not leaving without her.
KERI=>John, you can't help her now.
JOHN=>What? Where is she?
KERI=>John...
JOHN=>Oh, God... no... not Molly.
KERI=>Please, get on the bus...
WILL=>Keri, you all right?
KERI=>We've got to get these kids out of here...
WILL=>I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
KERI=>You go ahead. Will and I will follow you in my car.
KERI=>Will... Will, where are you?
KERI=>Oh, God, Will...
KERI=>Get off me...
KERI=>You son of a bitch!
KERI=>Shit!
KERI=>Time to put an end to this nightmare, motherfucker!
CARTER=>What the hell?
CARTER=>What's happening?
DRIVER=>We're evacuating the school. Been two murders up there tonight. Killer's still on the loose...
CARTER=>Goddamnit!
DEPUTY CLARK=>Call for back-up!
CARTER=>Blake, what's going on up there!
CARTER=>Blake! Do you hear me? Blake!
KERI=>Let's ends this right now. You want to kill me to fulfill your twisted obsession, then go ahead. I'm tired of playing hide-and- seek, brother. Come on, finish what you started, you miserable fuck.
THE SHAPE=>Laurie...
KERI=>Michael... Go to hell!
KERI=>Guess he was stoppable, after all.
JOHN=>I just can't believe she's dead.
KERI=>I love you, John.
JOHN=>Yeah, me too, Keri.
KERI=>Call me Laurie, will ya?
JOHN=>Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
KERI=>That would work.
