FATHER=>Oof. Look at this.
WAJDA=>Thanks, Grandma!
MS. JAMILA=>The proposal for the Koran competition in the religion club. We just need your signature to request the prize money awards. $800 riyals.
MOTHER=>Really? Abeer? Daughter of Mariam? How did she even end up in a car with him? Who is he? Of course, he’s a playboy like his Father.
MOTHER=>Religious police? Mariam must be dying! They should have married her off a long time ago. Pretty girls are like curses.
BEARDED MAN=>No idols! Don't you fear God?
MS. HUSSA=>The competition is two parts: you’ll to study the associated vocabulary along with the reasons why the verses were descended from heaven. You also have to learn the verses and the proper recitation. The correct tone, rhythm and pacing are very important.
ABDULLAH=>I let you catch me!
WAJDA=>What do you want?
KORAN TEACHER=>This isn't a laughing matter. You are young ladies now. Your bodies are fragile like flowers and there are dangers lurking around every corner. All right, let's read.
KORAN TEACHER=>Let's start with the new face in our group - Wajda. Start with Surat al Nisa, from ayat 59.
KORAN TEACHER=>Wajda, what do you think?
MS. HUSSA=>So you still insist that you weren't doing anything there behind the school?
WAJDA=>It's a very distinct vest.
SALESMAN=>You mean like this?
MOTHER=>I almost forgot. Ms. Hussa called earlier.
KORAN TEACHER=>Okay, put them away now. Wajda's right, you're not allowed to show pictures at school.
KORAN TEACHER=>Let's get started. Yasmine, read from page 13.
WAJDA=>Don’t mention it. But don’t sell my bicycle.
WAJDA=>I know that one.
MOTHER=>And whatever happens, for God's sake, act wise. No bargaining, no fighting, and no crazy ideas about bicycles. Watch that tongue of yours. Understand?
MS. HUSSA=>Correct. Thank you.
KORAN TEACHER=>…And they are sure of the hereafter.
MS. HUSSA=>Wajda, please come over here.
KORAN TEACHER=>You know very well you shouldn't bring notes like this to school, not after the whole saga with Fatin and Fatima.
MS. HUSSA=>Wajda Al Safan, you are our champion. Congratulations! You are in this spot because of your devotion and perseverance, and I hope all the girls here today learn from your example.
