INSIDE THE MANOR=>Unlit and still. Gothic with a theme of antique games, arcane puzzles and decorative weapons. First floor: A drawing room, living room, kitchen. The detritus of a party. Stray champagne flutes.
MARTA=>to the cop It's ok, sorry.
MEG=>mutters
RICHARD=>I'm not the cop so I don't know. Alright fine, don't come, get arrested. Die up your own ass all I care. hangs up He's not coming.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>We are just going to reintroduce ourselves as a formality, I'm Detective Lieutenant Elliott, and this is Trooper Wagner. Now, I'm going to record, just makes it easier. Alright, we're with Linda Drysdale, nee Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter, in discussing the events the night of his demise, one week ago, November 8th.
TROOPER WAGNER=>We're sorry for your loss.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>So we understand that night the family had gathered to celebrate your father's eighty fifth birthday.
LINDA=>Uh. There was Fran, the housekeeper. Marta, Harlan's caregiver, good girl, hard worker. Family's from Ecuador. And Wanetta - Greatnana, Harlan's mom.
LINDA=>N...o, Richard came early to help the caterers set up.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Okay and you and your husband Richard work for a real estate firm in Boston?
LINDA=>It's my company.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>So we are with Joni Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's... daughter in law?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>And you remained close to the Thrombeys.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private investigator of great renown.
BLANC=>Harlan shouted the phrase
HARLAN=>...you tell her or I will!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Why don't we take a breather.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>You ask me to drag all these good people back for questioning, go over it all again, I don't get it. This is a pleasant family with the usual quarrels but no possible motives for murder - where are you going?
MARTA=>Yeah, I don't work for a VNA. Harlan hired me directly. BLANC
MARTA=>I started at 15, but slowly he... needed more help. BLANC
MARTA=>Who told you that? BLANC
BLANC=>Granted. But she lied. To me. All three of them did.
TROOPER WAGNER=>An envelope? That worked?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>And Linda is a light sleeper. So we know every time someone took the stairs that night.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>The first was when Joni heard a ka- THUNK from somewhere above her in the house.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Walt was smoking a cigar on the porch with his son. He saw her leave and drive off, and noted the time - midnight.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Fifteen minutes later, Linda is woken for the third and final time. By someone coming down the stairs.
WALT=>Dad, go to bed!
MARTA=>How was tonight?
HARLAN=>Is there a problem?
MARTA=>Lets not call it that right now - three milligrams. HARLAN
HARLAN=>Stand here, keep your back to me, don't say a word.
JONI=>Love you, Night. HARLAN
HARLAN=>AFTER the carved elephant.
MARTA=>THIS is the tricky part?
WALT=>Dad, go to bed.
BLANC=>Well that sounds about right. Thank you Ms. Cabrera.
NIGHT OF THE PARTY=>Harlan and Ransom go off together to have a private talk, leaving the family having a heated conversation in the living room.
DINNER? TO EAT? EAT?=>Meg grabs Walt, pulls him to Marta.
MARTA=>Gravity's Rainbow. BLANC
MARTA=>What but - why me?
BLANC=>Tomorrow at eight.
MOM=>of course
BLANC=>to Marta
BLANC=>Can your guys digitize it so we can scan it properly?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Awesome. Blanc the grounds are lovely but you think what, someone broke into the house? To kill Harlan? Is that why we're out here?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Any luck with - whatshisname?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>I'm Lieutenant Elliott, this is officer Wagner, we'd like to ask you a few questions about the night of
WALT=>to Ransom
RICHARD=>The hell were you doing in the bathroom all night?
MEG=>Alt right troll.
JACOB=>Liberal snowflake.
WALT=>Ok you wanna go?
RANSOM=>mock gravity
RICHARD=>Did Harlan tell you he was cutting you out of the will?
BLANC=>No, just traces.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Depending on when it was last cleaned, it could be from anytime
JONI=>Linda please - Marta, you need to tell us though,
WALT=>Yes Marta, did dad discuss this with you?
HONK!=>She turns - a honking car pulls up right beside her and through the family crowd she sees Ransom in his Porsche, waving "get in." With no other options she pushes out of her car and through the family and JUMPS IN with him. As he GUNS IT and careens out of the driveway he shouts back at the family with a wave
RICHARD=>Would a sound person do this! Sound how?
MARTA=>What do you mean?
MARTA=>in a daze
MARTA=>...with my mother.
BLANC=>What's the cheese?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>And speaking of security, the security tape from the Thrombey residence was scrambled. For some reason.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>The report on the blood work.
MARTA=>What's going on? BLANC
HER MEDICAL BAG.=>She kneels, picks it up gently. Next to where it was lying, she finds something else curious - the burned remnants of a piece of paper. Only a charred corner remains. She turns her attention back to the room. Creeps forward.
FRAN=>...copy... copy
MARTA=>It's ok, Meg. I understand. Believe me. It's alright.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT=>Blanc I understand that this is amusing for you -
BLANC=>Why. Was. I. Hired? Why would someone hire me?
MARTA=>Trooper Wagner??
MARTA=>Then Harlan was... BLANC
GREATNANA=>Ransom, you're back!
BLANC=>Unless you decide.
PLUNGER.=>MINUTES LATER - her inert body in the chair. He fishes through her pockets, finds the envelope, and takes the TOX REPORT from it, leaves the empty envelope in her hands. On his way out: lights the tox report on fire, drops it burning next to Marta's bag. We stay with it as it burns away.
BLANC=>to Ransom
TROOPER WAGNER=>That means she was lying!
MARTA=>to Ransom
