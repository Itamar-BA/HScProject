SAM=>Brutal out there.
SUIT GIRL=>Sorry... bad for the seat, right?
SUIT GIRL=>What about your things?
SUIT GIRL=>Thanks for the ride. Let myself out.
SUIT GIRL=>Your bed’s really soft.
SAM=>It’s not that bad.
CLAIRE=>I thought so... you run away?
CLAIRE=>You know you can’t stay here, right?
CLAIRE=>What you need to do right now though is take a bath.
MITCH=>Okay Bexley, outtie.
SAM=>Night, Suit Girl.
MITCH=>Right, sure. Later.
SUIT GIRL=>What about your family?
CLAIRE=>Why are you both wet?
CLAIRE=>Sam Perry, you are in so much fucking trouble when you get back here!
CLAIRE=>No, I’m done yelling.
SUIT GIRL=>I promise I do and it’s okay if you don’t cause I swear it doesn’t matter, we can just stay alone together, I can pretend to be your wife or girlfriend and we can do grown-up stuff...
SAM=>I don’t NEED to...
MITCH=>You tried to kill yourself?
SUIT GIRL=>Yeah, will you be okay?
ELIZABETH=>Come on back, we’re just teasing you. Can’t you take a joke?
SAM=>What jerk, where?
SAM=>Where’s Suit Girl?
SUIT GIRL=>You cost me every chance I ever get at happiness. And I don’t want to be you anymore.
SUIT GIRL=>...why did you help me?
SUIT GIRL=>I don’t belong with you.
CLAIRE=>No. Absolutely not.
SAM=>...you’re serious?
SAM=>What’s going on!?
SAM=>Never never never.
CLAIRE=>Welcome home, my little dove.
CLAIRE=>I can call you that, can’t I?
SUIT GIRL=>I was hoping you would.
MITCH=>Don’t think it was a happy ending, though. There were bad times...
MITCH=>But we would sometimes get the big things right.
MITCH=>Rookie mistake. But that’s okay. She’s still young.
