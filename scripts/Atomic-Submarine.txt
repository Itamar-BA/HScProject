NARRATOR=>It cost Commander Robert Peary twenty years or unremitting hard- ship and misery to reach the North Pole, finally, in 1909.
NARRATOR=>It would have astounded Peary to learn that, by the late 1950's and early 60's, the vast, frozen top-of-the-world he pioneered had become a vital highway for world travel and commerce. Not just in the skies...
NARRATOR=>...but also deep under the ice, in the frigid, five-million-square- mile depths of the Arctic Ocean.
NARRATOR=>Here great passenger and cargo- carrying atomic submarines glided by the dozens, back and forth across the Pole, until a series of mysterious undersea disasters threatened to close the Arctic route forever.
NARRATOR=>The decisive moment came May 3, at 1315 hours, when the undersea atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of them all, reached 87 degrees, 10 minutes north latitude - only a few miles from the North Pole it- self!
CLOSE ARCTIC SEA LANE=>AFTER EPIC DISASTER!!
NARRATOR=>According to the official reports, the next phase of the life-and- death drama occurred May 10, in Washington --
BUREAU OF ARCTIC DEFENSE WAR ROOM NO ADMITTANCE WITHOUT SPECIAL=>SECURITY CLEARANCE
NARRATOR=>-- at a hush-hush, super-secret meeting in the Arctic theater war room.
NARRATOR=>Admiral Terhune, in charge of the Arctic Theater for the Joint Chiefs, well knew the effect the 'leak' of any of the explosive information would have on the world civilian population. So the Admiral was determined: There would be no leaks!
WENDOVER=>Admiral Terhune!
ADMIRAL=>Gentlemen, this is the man we've been waiting for - Skipper of the atom killer sub, Tiger Shark - Commander Dan Wendover. This is Justin Murdock, Secretary of Defense...
WENDOVER=>Mr. Murdock...
MURDOCK=>Commander.
ADMIRAL=>And I know you've heard of Dr. Clifford Kent, Dan --
KENT=>Commander.
ADMIRAL=>Dr. Kent had a lot to do with the development and design of your boat.
MURDOCK=>Sir Ian Hunt just flew in from London.
WENDOVER=>Are you the Doctor Hunt - Nobel prize winner for Oceanography?
SIR IAN=>Let's say I took the bows for a team of brrlliant associates.
ADMIRAL=>Gentlemen, to begin, let me read you just one line from a detailed staff study prepared for the Joint Chiefs: "In our judgment, these Arctic disasters may prove the gravest emergency in all history."
MURDOCK O.S.=>Any comments on that statement?
SIR IAN=>Bit on the fanciful side, isn't it, Sir?
ADMIRAL=>Possibly, possibly. Let me read you a partial list of observed phenomena: 1. Complete disruption of communica- tions with Dew line warning stations. 2. Destruction of four surface vessels, largest, 10,000 tons. 3. Radioactivity in Arctic waters, floe ice and bergs. 4. Peculiar television images preceding each distress call. 5. Seven Polar atom subs, vanished without a trace! "Fanciful" did you say, Sir Ian?
ADMIRAL=>Now we come to you, Dan. You skipper the Tiger Shark, the most advanced, the deadliest killer sub in the fleet. Right now she's undergoing emergency, around the clock modification in the Bremerton navy yard.
ADMIRAL O.S.=>Removal of all but two atomic torpedos. Special launching equipment for water-to-air ballistic missiles. A special escape hatch in the keel for the Lungfish.
WENDOVER=>'The Lungfish?'
ADMIRAL=>A special deep-exploration device - sort of an animated diving bell. Captain Siguard Nielsen developed it, after he retired, if you remem- ber? He'll be going with you - - along with Dr. Kent, and Sir Ian.
ADMIRAL=>Special orders are being cut recalling your entire crew from leave, effective at once. There's a fast jet at National Airport waiting to fly you, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian to Seattle.
ADMIRAL O.S.=>The Mission of the Tiger Shark is to hunt down and identify the cause of these Arctic disasters. If humanly possible, you will remove it:
10-A.=>33-B INT. REEF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DAVE=>...Not that I don't think our Lieutenant Commander Holloway is the finest exec in the sub fleet, Julie...and not that he isn't the best friend I have -
HELEN=>Come on, Dave. You talk too much.
DAVE=>Quiet, Little Mother! I feel it behooves me to warn you -
DAVE=>Our friend Reef is no less than Number One Howl of the entire sub Wolf Pack. Nuclear powered! When it comes to women, he has a built-in sonar detector that -
REEF=>Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating - What do you think of this husband of yours? On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer. But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
DAVE=>But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work. She deserves a fighting chance!
REEF=>Helen. I appeal to you -
HELEN=>Dave! Look at me! I am the mother of your three children! Now please take me home to them. At once!
JULIE=>Dave is exaggerating. Just think, a man spends three months in a deep freeze. It'd take his whole shore leave just to thaw him out. By that time, he's ready to report back!
REEF=>It won't take me long to defrost - not around you!
JULIE=>What was I saying...about thawing out icebergs?
REEF=>You never can tell about ice- bergs. Only one-ninth above water.
JULIE=>After that kiss - I'd say that's about right.
REEF=>Do you feel anything?
JULIE=>Are you kidding???
REEF=>I mean - that this is the be- ginning of something - that it wasn't just...accidental, our getting together?
JULIE=>Original! Isn't the next chorus something about: 'Let's not waste one precious golden moment - any second, there could be a knock on the door, and -
REEF=>Stranger things have happened, you know. I've had leaves can- celled like -
JULIE=>Then by all means, let's not waste time!
JULIE=>I hear a bell.
REEF=>I hear a whole carillon of 'em!
JULIE=>What's that pounding?
REEF=>Need I say more?
JULIE=>Reef - look!
REEF=>Oh no!
JULIE=>What's wrong?
REEF=>Oh no!
BREMERTON NAVY YARD=>DOCKS 1-6 No Admittance Except to Authorized U.S. Navy Personnel
DAVE=>Reef!
REEF=>So they caught up with you, too?
DAVE=>At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home. Now -
REEF=>That's the worst possible moment?
DAVE=>What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
REEF=>Disappointing a big girl!
11-A=>40B
DAVE=>Julie!
DAVE=>Tough, old buddy! Really tough!
REEF=>Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
WENDOVER=>I did go. Just back. Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent. My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
REEF=>I met Dr. Kent, once.
KENT=>Nice to see you again, Commander.
REEF=>Are you men going with us? What for? Where -
WENDOVER=>We'll discuss that later.
WENDOVER=>Tell Chief Griffin to report to me as soon as the crew is aboard.
WENDOVER=>My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
SIR IAN=>Thank you.
CHESTER=>What's the scoop, Griff? Hauled out in the middle of the night - all leaves cancelled. We goin' to war, or what?
GRIFF=>Don't you worry, Chester. When the Skipper wants you to know what's going on, he'll tell you. Okay?
CHESTER=>I don't like it. This is all mighty funny -
GRIFF=>Isn't it, though? Suppose you get aboard, anyway, huh?
REEF=>I think I'll stow my gear.
WENDOVER=>I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef - You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
REEF=>Who with?
WENDOVER=>Dr. Neilsen. He'll be - -
REEF=>'Doctor' Neilsen? When did that happen?
WENDOVER=>Huh?
REEF=>It'll be all right. We're old friends!
WENDOVER=>Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
DAVE=>Right, Skipper.
REEF=>I understand we'll be sharing quarters, Skipper - Carl! You - !
REEF=>I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.' I thought it was your father.
CARL=>It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
REEF=>How is he - ?
CARL=>It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.
REEF=>And they thought you could re- place the Skipper?
CARL=>There was no choice. Dad and I developed the Lungfish together. Except for him, I'm the only one qualified to dive in it.
REEF=>You could train someone else.
CARL=>Not in two days. Look: Do you think I wanted to come? If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
REEF=>That I can believe!
NARRATOR=>The Tiger Shark left her dock at Bremerton at 0335 hours, the morning of May 11, on what was to prove the strangest, most fearful voyage ever made by a submarine, atomic or otherwise.
NARRATOR=>Simultaneously with the 'Shark's' departure, and with his crew still in the dark concerning their secret, fateful mission, Skipper Wendover made the first notation in the log...
NARRATOR=>...The men would remain un-briefed for two hours, until the Tiger Shark cleared Puget Sound and was headed for the open sea...
GRIFF=>Who the devil belongs to this... gear?
POWELL O.S.=>We do, Chief.
GRIFF=>Oh? You two guys - what do you do around here?
CARNEY=>Underwater demolition. Seamen First Class Powell... ...and I'm Carney.
GRIFF=>Yeah, I know - so you're frogmen!
POWELL=>We're off tin cans. We've looked this pig-boat over from fore-to-aft, but can't seem to find an empty locker to stow our stuff.
GRIFF=>An empty locker in a sub? Are you kidding? This whole deal is making less and less sense to me. What're frogmen doing aboard the Tiger Shark?
CARNEY=>Following orders, like everybody else in the navy.
GRIFF=>Beats me. I don't envy you swabbies, swimmin' in that North Pole ice water.
POWELL=>Meantime, where'll we stash these gizmos?
GRIFF=>Come on. Maybe we can hide it somewhere in the aft torpedo room.
NARRATOR=>Shortly before dawn, the Tiger Shark, running submerged at better than thirty knots, had left the Sound behind and was headed for the open sea.
WENDOVER=>These are our orders, Reef. Better look them over while I fill in the crew.
WENDOVER=>Now hear this: All men of the Tiger Shark. This is the Captain speaking. I know you're wondering about all the mystery -
WENDOVER O.S.=>Our mission is so dangerous it had to be kept completely secret. It's our job to find out what caused the disasters under the Arctic ice. Once we cross the Arctic Circle, any command you hear will be the real thing, remember that!
WENDOVER=>That's about it. Now you know as much as I do - as much as anybody does - I assured Washington this was the best crew of the best sub in the fleet. I know you won't make a liar out of me!
DAVE=>Well!
WENDOVER=>What do you think?
REEF=>I think I should have joined the Air Force!
NARRATOR=>A week later, the Tiger Shark was still running due north at cruising speed. So far the voyage was routine, uneventful. But the nearer they came to the Arctic Circle...
NARRATOR=>On the morning of May 20, the Tiger Shark crossed the Arctic Circle into the critical area...
OMIT=>74A
REEF=>You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
DAVE=>Huh?
REEF=>I might have a son like that!
DAVE=>I don't get it. What's with you two?
REEF=>I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
DAVE=>I guess.
REEF=>One of the finest men, and officers, alive. A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two. He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
DAVE=>So?
REEF=>So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist. A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot! 'Ban the atom tests! Junk the nuclear subs! Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
DAVE=>A lot of people think like that.
REEF=>But they're not Skipper Neilsen's son! It broke his heart. Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy. Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
DAVE=>Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
REEF=>'His' side? I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
REEF=>Any of you men seen Dr. Neilsen?
CHESTER=>He's here, Sir.
REEF=>Tuttle, would you mind leaving us alone for a minute?
CHESTER=>Sure, Mr. Holloway.
CARL=>What is it?
REEF=>Your 'out.' This came for you.
CARL=>My father! He's not - ?
REEF=>Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
CARL=>What did you mean: I'm 'out?'
REEF=>Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow. We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
CARL=>You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you? Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
REEF=>You said it. But I won't argue -
CARL=>Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, Commander! It just so happens I'm not a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
REEF=>We're all risking our lives!
CARL=>That may be. But Dad stays where he is, and I'm staying here!
REEF=>You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
CARL=>Perhaps. But the idea of willingly going to school to spend my life at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - that strikes me as the worst cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
REEF=>You mean nothing is worth fighting for?
CARL=>Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit! Show me a man who says you win those by fighting wars, and I'll show you an idiot!
REEF=>You may not win them. But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, long ago!
REEF=>What the - ?
WENDOVER=>Mr. Holloway to the Con, please! On the double!
DAVE=>The instruments have all gone crazy! And look at the view screen!
SIR IAN=>Incredible! Absolutely!
REEF=>What hit us???
SIR IAN=>The end of the world!
KENT=>It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
SIR IAN=>Under water?
KENT=>High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged. And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
WENDOVER=>Is there any way out of it?
DAVE=>Seems to be all around...
WENDOVER=>What about down?
DAVE=>I...don't know!
WENDOVER=>We're dead if we stay here, that's for sure. Take her down! Maximum angle, maxi- mum depth! Maybe even a little more!
REEF=>Aye, aye.
KENT=>Sir Ian has evolved a theory. At first, I wasn't about to buy it.
SIR IAN=>It is rather fantastic -
SIR IAN=>Here is a chart of the Arctic region. On it I have plotted every instance of these strange phenomena - sinkings, electrical storms, our own experiences...
SIR IAN O.S.=>Here was where we encountered the electrical storm...The Sturgeon was lost just about this area. Others...here, here, and here...
SIR IAN=>Do you see it?
WENDOVER=>See what?
SIR IAN=>The pattern. Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole. A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
SIR IAN O.S.=>...about the North Pole.
REEF=>Which adds up to what, Sir Ian?
SIR IAN=>I cannot accept the idea that these phenomena were either random, or natural. I believe they are motivated by... some sort of intelligence!
WENDOVER=>You mean somebody has been -
SIR IAN=>I did not mean to imply, neces- sarily, a 'human' intelligence.
CARL=>Then - what on earth kind of in- telligence is it, Sir Ian?
SIR IAN=>Perhaps not 'on earth' at all. Perhaps it comes from beyond the earth!
REEF=>Can anything be done about it?
SIR IAN=>I've been thinking about that. These appearances of...whatever we're dealing with...make almost a complete ring around the Pole. But there is what may be a signifi- cant gap, or break, in the ring...
SIR IAN O.S.=>...right here...the Queen Victoria Sea area, near Franz Joseph Land...
SIR IAN=>...above Murmansk, and Finland.
KENT=>Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this could be the next danger point!
SIR IAN=>What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit? Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
WENDOVER=>We'll chart a course straight across the pole - to bring us here - - the Queen Victoria Sea!
NARRATOR=>So - swiftly, implacably, the Tiger Shark moved across the Top of the World towards her rendezvous with...what?
DAVE O.S.=>We've been heading due south, 30 degrees longitude. By my reckoning we're about ten angular seconds...
DAVE=>...short of the Arctic meridian, and that should be...
SIR IAN=>...the critical point - if we're on the right track.
WENDOVER=>Prepare to surface. We'll run at flank speed.
OPERATOR=>Mr. Milburn - quick - look at this!
REEF=>Skipper! Those chunks of ice - coming right at us!
WENDOVER=>Dive! Dive!
DAVE=>Captain! Come here!
WENDOVER=>Determine extent of damage, immediately.
REEF=>After torpedo room: Report!
GRIFF'S VOICE=>This is Griff, Captain. Moderate leak in overhead plates. Damage to main drive shaft housing. Forced to stop reactor engines.
REEF=>We're dead in the water!
DAVE=>Skipper! You've got to see this! You too, Sir Ian!
WENDOVER=>Well, I'll be - !
SIR IAN=>I'll be another!
REEF=>What is it?
WENDOVER=>Course and speed?
DAVE=>Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
SIR IAN=>Directly towards the Pole!
GRIFF=>Okay - you two flounders look about set. And remember - this ain't no swimming pool - we need a damage report!
POWELL=>See what I mean about volunteering -
SIR IAN O.S.=>...a pure oval shape, with this cyclops-like eye, or turret, on top. I'd estimate its diameter at 300 feet. No discernible ori- fices...
SIR IAN=>'The Eye of Cyclops..!'
CARL=>What did you say, Sir Ian?
SIR IAN=>Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer. 'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
WENDOVER=>Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
KENT=>I knew there was something familiar -
KENT=>Take a look.
KENT O.S.=>The picture was taken by an amateur astronomer, over New Mexico.
KENT=>I've had it since I served on the Air Force Evaluation Board, for UFO reports.
CARL=>Unidentified Flying Objects.
REEF=>Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
KENT=>That was the popular designation.
CARL=>But...weren't all the sightings in the sky - not under water?
SIR IAN=>This would explain why there were never any reports of land- ings. It's possible that who- ever - or whatever - inhabits the craft is not a land creature, but a form of marine life.
DAVE=>That would make our 'little green men' actually 'little grean fish'???
REEF=>Undersea flying saucers!
GRIFF=>Excuse me, Skipper---
WENDOVER=>Yes, Griff?
GRIFF=>All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
REEF=>Then we can get under way?
WENDOVER=>You plotted the course of Cyclops? Then that's our course! Wherever he goes, we go.....until we get him!
SIR IAN=>Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
NARRATOR=>So, the Tiger Shark began relentlessly stalking her space-enemy. Up to the Pole, back to the Arctic Circle... again, and again...a week... a fortnight, a month....
NARRATOR=>Never a glimpse of their enemy, but there were reports...new disasters, new ships and lives lost. Invariably, the Tiger Shark made for the scene, only to arrive after Cyclops had left. For all its desperatian, the pursuit seemed fruitless.
NARRATOR=>Then, on July 3, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian held an urgent discussion with Reef and the Skipper...
SIR IAN=>We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
WENDOVER=>But answers are what we need - not more questions!
KENT=>We think maybe, now, we have them!
KENT=>We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear. But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's magnetic?
SIR IAN=>We harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force. Maybe Cyclops does it on a super scale....
KENT=>The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
REEF=>What you're getting at: You think our saucer-friend has to return to the Pole, regularly to....recharge his batteries?
SIR IAN=>That may be over-simplifying, but---
KENT=>Now: Our present tactics are hopeless. But suppose we could place ourselves between Cyclops and the Pole....
SIR IAN=>....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it.... ...'recharging his batteries'?
KENT=>If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
WENDOVER=>....we could polish him off with an atomic fish! That's it, Reef! We'll wait until the next report of trouble. Then we'll lay on the bottom, right in his path, and bushwack him!
SIR IAN=>'Bushwack?'
REEF=>American tactical expression.
NARRATOR=>So - a chance of tactics. Now the Tiger Shark cruised almost over the North Pole, waiting for the radio report that would put the plan into effect... On July 13, at 1600 hours, it came!
DAVE=>We got it, Reef!
REEF=>Cyclops?
DAVE=>Sounds like it! Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
REEF=>Where's the Skipper?
DAVE=>Already in the Con!
DAVE=>We're here!
WENDOVER=>You're sure?
WENDOVER=>All right, then we're for it, right here. Sonar and TV, scan the bottom, find a nice spot for us to lie and wait for him -- maybe a cave, or a valley.
NARRATOR=>Hour upon hour, the Tiger Shark lay in its deep-six ambush... The Arctic depths were as still and silent as an uninhabited world. Then, at 0600 hours....
DAVE=>Skipper! Dr. Kent!
WENDOVER=>What is it?
KENT=>That's him! Has to be!
DAVE=>Range, about twenty-two miles. Speed....I give it fourteen knots.
KENT=>His radiation level is very low! That would confirm our theory - about having to return to the Pole!
WENDOVER=>It better be correct! Get me a setup on the TDC - range, about seven miles!
WENDOVER=>Skipper to Exec: Arm atomic warheads! Load 1 and 2... Report to Con pronto!
GRIFF=>Sounds like we mean business!
REEF=>Griff, you arm No. 2. I'll handle No. 1.
REEF=>Load One and Two. Then open outer doors! And stand by for action!
DAVE=>Range: Now fifteen miles!
REEF=>You're sure it's Cyclops?
WENDOVER=>Take a look.
DAVE=>Range....ten miles!!
DAVE=>Zero minus ten....nine....
DAVE=>....four....three....two....
DAVE=>Zero!
WENDOVER=>Fire Number One!
GRIFF=>Number One fired!
WENDOVER=>Fire Number Two!
GRIFF=>Number Two fired!
WENDOVER=>What's the running time?
REEF=>Thirty-four seconds!
CONTROL ROOM TORPEDO ROOM=>CREW QUARTERS
DAVE=>Number One...Missed!
WENDOVER=>How could it? We were dead on target, with a homing torpedo!
DAVE=>A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
WENDOVER=>What???
KENT=>It must function like a de-Gaussing field. We'll never get a torpedo through that!
WENDOVER=>Maybe not a torpedo...
WENDOVER=>This is the Captain: Blow bow tanks. Reactor Room, stand by: Soon as we're off the bottom, I want all ahead, flank speed, pronto!
DAVE=>What course, Skipper?
WENDOVER=>Right at our one-eyed friend!
REEF=>Right at him?
WENDOVER=>That's what I said!
REEF=>But - what can we accomplish?
WENDOVER=>We can ram him!
CARL=>You've weighed the consequences, Captain - the lives involved?
WENDOVER=>Doctor -- I've weighed the lives Cyclops has taken, already...and will take, in the future, unless we can stop him, now!
CARL=>We might find other means...
WENDOVER=>What other means? If the Tiger Shark can't destroy him, no power on Earth can! Now brave yourselves!
WENDOVER=>This is the Captain! All crew members take collision stations!
DAVE=>We got him, Skipper - drove right into him!
REEF=>Speared him like a fish!
WENDOVER=>This is the Skipper! We did it, men! Drove right through the saucer's hide!
CONTROL ROOM TORPEDO ROOM=>CREW'S QUARTERS
WENDOVER=>We'd better wiggle loose. Reactor Room: I want all re- verse, full!
REEF=>We're stuck tight!
DAVE=>Skipper! Look at the depth gauge!
WENDOVER=>A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
REEF=>It's the screws, Skipper. At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark and Cyclops right to the bottom.
WENDOVER=>And we're at safe maximum depth already.... Stop engines!
REEF=>Stop engines!
NARRATOR=>Hours later, the two titantic craft were still locked to- gether in an apparent death grip...
NARRATOR=>...on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, nearly twelve hundred feet below the surface!
WENDOVER=>If anyone has any more ideas... I'll try anything, before just lying here, waiting to die!
REEF=>Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
WENDOVER=>What?
REEF=>If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
SIR IAN=>That's all very fine, young man. But how would one go about get- ting inside Cyclops?
REEF=>Through the eye - with the Depth-Explorer!
CARL=>Yes - the Explorer was built to operate at even greater depths --
WENDOVER=>But suppose there isn't an atmos- phere inside the saucer?
REEF=>Then the idea's no good. But we're no worse off than we are right now.
DAVE=>You've got to let us try, Skipper --
REEF=>'Us?'
DAVE=>Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
CARL=>No, you can't. But I can -- I can deliver you to the eye. Then you --
REEF=>Little out of your line, isn't it? You better stay aboard and make a speech -- maybe get 'em to ban flying saucers!
CARL=>That's enough, Holloway. I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
REEF=>- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
CARL=>However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm not a coward! And it happens you've got no choice: Either I take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
REEF=>I'd sooner swim!
WENDOVER=>That's enough, Reef! Both of you! It so happens Dr. Neilsen's right. The odds are long enough, without making them longer. Get the Explorer in the airlock, ready for launching.
WENDOVER=>You better take Powell and Carney with you --
DAVE=>The frogmen?
WENDOVER=>With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
DAVE=>Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
WENDOVER=>We hope!
REEF=>Let's get ready.
NARRATOR=>Preparations consumed only an hour. At 1100, everything was ready for this last, desperate attempt.
REEF=>There's still time. You could show me how...?
CARL=>Get in.
WENDOVER=>Go ahead, Griff!
DAVE=>Now what?
REEF=>Now what - shall we take a chance?
CARL=>That's why we came.
REEF=>All right. Better breathe oxygen, just in case.
262A REEF=>Air! Pure air! Under high pressure!
DAVE=>That's a relief!
POWELL=>What happens now, sir?
REEF=>You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.
DAVE=>Not alone, you're not!
CARL=>Good luck, men!
OMIT=>263 to
0MIT 267A=>267B
OMIT 267D=>267E
DAVE=>How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
REEF=>What's more important - there's our problem. The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
DAVE=>I think you're right.
REEF=>Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
REEF=>Now let's get to work.
CARL=>Depth-Explorer to Tiger Shark. Do you read? Over.
WENDOVER=>We read you! Go ahead, Doctor! They're inside the saucer. It's filled with breathable air!
KENT=>Wonderful!
WENDOVER=>That's wonderful, Carl! Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
SIR IAN=>What is it like, inside Cyclops? This is a priceless opportunity for....
WENDOVER=>Tell Reef: Be sure you're all clear before we make a move! Good!
WENDOVER=>Maybe we'll come out of this yet!
GRIFF=>Skipper - could you take a look here...?
WENDOVER=>Something wrong?
GRIFF=>The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
WENDOVER=>Why do you say that?
GRIFF=>We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
WENDOVER=>What????
SIR IAN=>But that's impossible!
KENT=>The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
SIR IAN=>What direction does the system indicate?
WENDOVER=>Due north. At five knots...no, six!
SIR IAN=>Toward the Pole!
GRIFF=>But - that cyclops is dead! We killed it...didn't we? Didn't we?
274A=>OMIT
OMIT 274B=>274C
REEF=>Dave?
DAVE=>Yeah?
REEF=>Listen! Hear that?
DAVE=>I don't hear anything. Maybe you've been down here too long. Why don't you go back up and -
REEF=>Strange you didn't hear it.
OMIT=>274F
DAVE=>Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!
REEF=>You know - it is?
DAVE=>And if I didn't know better - I'd swear we were moving!
REEF=>Let's get back to work, and maybe we will be, soon.
CARL=>...I get an impression of move- ment, Captain. Is that possible?
VOICE OF WENDOVER=>We have the same reaction, up here.
CARL=>But ---
WENDOVER=>Now they feel it...down below.
KENT=>Radiation level...constantly rising...
SIR IAN=>As we near the Pole...
KENT=>There's got to be an explanation!
SIR IAN=>There is. I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
REEF=>That does it! I think the Shark can pull clear!
SAUCER-VOICE=>Commander Holloway! Listen!
REEF=>You hear that?
DAVE=>The sound again?
SAUCER-VOICE=>Commander Holloway. Make no resistance.
REEF=>A voice, this time. It spoke my name!
SAUCER-VOICE=>You will see that avails nothing!
POWELL=>Carney - help!
REEF=>Carney, see what's happened to Powell.
DAVE=>Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
REEF=>Somewhere down there?
DAVE=>Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
REEF=>We'll have to look for them later.
REEF=>Well?
DAVE=>I'm with you!
SAUCER VOICE=>Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
REEF=>Come where?
DAVE=>The voice again?
DAVE=>What're you doing?
SAUCER VOICE=>To me - here!
REEF=>Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
DAVE=>Oh it does???
SAUCER VOICE=>So, Commander Holloway - as you Earth inhabitants would express it - we meet 'face to face.'
REEF=>That's a face???
SAUCER VOICE=>Point of view is everything. To us, your form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
REEF=>Tell me something: Why can I hear you, when the others couldn't?
SAUCER VOICE=>You do not 'hear' me! Our in- dividual brain frequencies are now attuned, and we exchange wave-thoughts.
REEF O.S.=>You mean 'Extra Sensory Per- ception?'
SAUCER VOICE=>Whatever your 'earth-term' may be. The principal is ancient, and very simple.
SAUCER VOICE=>It is not necessary for you to speak. Your 'thought-response' will suffice.
SAUCER VOICE=>My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
REEF=>- for horrors like yourself?
SAUCER=>Of course. It may interest you to know I have visited hundreds of other worlds, and of all of them, your Earth seems most suit- able.
REEF=>Swell!
SAUCER VOICE=>Your friend was to remain where he was!
REEF=>He did!
SAUCER VOICE=>I am afraid not. Therefore -
REEF=>Dave - !
DAVE=>What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
SAUCER VOICE=>Stand away from him, Commander!
DAVE=>So this is 'headquarters,' huh? Well, you've sunk your last ship, you....
REEF=>Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
SAUCER VOICE=>On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
REEF=>Why?
SAUCER VOICE=>I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study. We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
REEF O.S.=>Then you just...'build them in?'
SAUCER VOICE=>Of course. Evolution is much too slow a process.
SAUCER VOICE=>On earth you build with inanimate material. We employ living tissue. This space vehicle, for example...
SAUCER VOICE=>It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
REEF=>That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
SAUCER VOICE=>Of course. But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
REEF=>To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
SAUCER VOICE=>Obviously.
REEF=>That might be a little rough!
OMIT=>310D
REEF=>Back to the Shark - right now!
CARL=>What about Dave - and the others?
REEF=>'Fortunes of War!'
REEF=>This is Reef, Skipper -- in the Depth-Explorer. Don't wait for us - start engines, and pull loose!
WENDOVER=>All right, Reef.
WENDOVER=>Reactor Room! This is the Skipper! I want all reverse full-emergency power!
WENDOVER=>What about --- ?
REEF=>We didn't kill it, Skipper. And if it ever gets...back where it came from...the Earth is doomed, and everything and everybody on it!
VOICE=>We've pulled loose, Skipper! We're free!
REEF=>Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
WENDOVER=>Nothing we can do, now.
KENT=>Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
WENDOVER=>Anything ---
KENT=>It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
WENDOVER=>What about time...?
SIR IAN=>Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
WENDOVER=>All right - go to it.
NARRATOR=>Adapt a complicated guidance system to a huge ballistic rocket - convert it to a water-to-air intercept missile? It was foolish, it was insane, it was fantastic - but it was their only hope - and the earth's only hope!
SIR IAN=>All ready?
KENT=>As ready as we can be! I'll report to the Skipper.
REEF=>Right under our hole in the ice, Skipper.
WENDOVER=>What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
REEF=>Minus three.
WENDOVER=>Take over here, Reef.
WENDOVER=>Prepare ICBM for firing!
WENDOVER=>Well, that's all we can do -- until our space-friend decides to blast-off.
REEF=>Skipper - I think - it is! It's Cyclops!
WENDOVER=>This is the Skipper! Fire! Fire!
CARL=>They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars. But now - I wonder -
REEF=>Yes?
CARL=>Which is the one - we have to worry about?
REEF=>Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
CARL=>But if they do?
REEF=>I don't know.
CARL=>I wouldn't worry. So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
REEF=>And his 'egghead' son! We'll give 'em a rough reception, won't we?
