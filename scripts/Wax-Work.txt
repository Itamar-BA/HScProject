MARKS MOTHER=>Darling? I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night. Now you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.

MARKS MOTHER=>One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
MARK=>They're all human beings
MARKS MOTHER=>Servants. Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared

CHINA=>With Mark?
SARAH=>He still likes you
CHINA=>Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob. He doesn't even know how to spell `lady' let alone treat me like one. You know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink?
SARAH=>He did?
CHINA=>Yes, I'm sure. What I need is an older man, something with class, a little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
SARAH=>Businessman?
CHINA=>Businessman!
SARAH=>Doctor? Lawyer?
CHINA=>Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
SARAH=>Yeah, yeah, OK

MARK=>I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
TONY=>Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
SARAH=>Hey, China's a friend of mine
MARK=>Look at that. If he got on top of you, you'd have a better chance with a steamroller.
SARAH=>Stop saying things so loud!
TONY=>Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
CHINA=>Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
MARK=>Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez. Can't even take a joke
TONY=>Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
SARAH=>You guys are being real assholes
MARK=>Thank you Sarah
JONATHAN=>Hey babe, are we going to catch a flick tonight, get a little of that back row boogie?
CHINA=>Oh I don't know handsome, I'm a little tired
JONATHAN=>Yeah, me too after last night. Hey Mark, want to go play catch? Or are you incapable of doing that as well?
TONY=>Don't do it superman, you only got one life man.
JAMES=>Hey Mark, I see you've made a new friend. I hope he'll fit through the front door.
GEMMA=>What's happening tonight guys?
CHINA=>Well, Sarah and I were invited to a late night waxwork show by the handsomest gentleman
GEMMA=>No kidding?

CHINA=>Well, Sarah and I are going, how about you Tone?
TONY=>You bet. We all can't be such modern people
SARAH=>Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not. I'll get the maid to write the essays
TONY=>YES!
MARK=>Anybody want another drink?
CHINA=>It's eleven forty-five let's go
TONY=>What's the rush babe, got a date with Jonathan after the show?
CHINA=>Can't a girl get laid around here without being burned at the stake?
TONY=>Oh ho! That's. SARAH, JAMES, TONY, GEMMA ...gotta hurt!
MARK=>We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
MARK=>About what? About us.
CHINA=>Us is over. You had your chance you blew it.
MARK=>Right. CHINA I need a taking care of, not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'. I'm looking for something just a little more in a man. A little `je nes se qua'.
MARK=>A little what? CHINA See. You don't even speak French.
MARK=>I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
CHINA=>Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
MARK=>Suffer? We're living in America.
JAMES=>Nice place for a waxwork.
CHINA=>Yea, that's what we said.
SARAH=>Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
TONY=>Never fear, Tony is here. Ladies first.
CHINA=>Well what a gentleman. I think I'll play feminist tonight.
CHINA=>Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
MARK=>Ok toots, I will.
MARK=>Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
TONY=>Safety in numbers man.
MARK=>Right.
TONY=>So we're fickle.
GEMMA=>James, I want to go home. JAMES What?! It was your idea to come in the first place.
GEMMA=>Yeah but this is not my idea of fun.

TONY=>Big party.
CHINA=>Hey, it's a private show, what do you want?
MARK=>If those guys are waxworks, they have definitely improved them since I was a kid.
TONY=>This time I really don't see anyone man.
MARK=>Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them. They begin walking around the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman. They give each other looks of disgust and continue on. The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms. The four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY
TONY=>This. is killer.
TONY=>They won't mind if I go in for my lighter.
TONY=>Well I uh, hope you guys can hear me cause this is a hell of an illusion. I mean, I can smell the pine trees.
TONY=>Ok - and uhhhh.. we got house.. and we got house. I guess we'll go to the house. Alright.
TONY=>Hypnotists, make this guy a little more friendly ok
TONY=>It's so cold in here! Why don't I just mosey on out, get some wood - we'll talk.
TONY=>Guess he didn't want to talk.
TONY=>Ahhhhhh SHIT!
TONY=>Hey boys, this isn't fun anymore! Get me the hell out of here!
HUNTER=>Damnit! We're too late! Give me the silver bullets!
TONY=>Oh! Oh this has gotta hurt!
HUNTER=>God forgive me.
CHINA=>Well what are you supposed to be doing hansom?
CHINA=>Let's just take a little look.
DRACULA=>Come to me.
DRACULA=>You've met my son, Stephan.
DRACULA=>Please, be seated.
DRACULA=>Raw meat. You do like raw meat? Please, if not we can have some soup.
CHINA=>No, that's fine. I haven't had steak tartar in a long time.
DRACULA=>Steak tartar? Oh yes, steak tartar.
CHINA=>No that's ok. If you recommend it I'll try it.
DRACULA=>It's a little salty; but that's all part of its charm.
DRACULA=>I must bid you goodnight. Ludwig will show you to your room.
CHINA=>Wow. What an intense dream.
CHINA=>Great dress.
CHINA=>Doesn't a gentleman knock?
STEPHAN=>Bitch!
CHINA=>Charles?
CHARLES=>Yes. Charles, you're fiancée.
CHARLES=>Oh dear darling.
CHARLES=>YES! I wish it were so! AHHHHHHH!!! GET IT OFF!

CHARLES=>Touch his head! Touch his head!
CHARLES=>BREAK IT!
DRACULA=>Going somewhere my beauty?
MARK=>China, Sarah, where are you guys?
MARK=>Haven't we been doing our homework.
SARAH=>I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
MARK=>Ok?
MARK=>Where the hell are they?
SARAH=>Somewhere around?
SARAH=>Getting scared? Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
MARK=>What? Tony and China, together?
SARAH=>Wooo. Jealously rearing its ugly head.
MARK=>I'm not kidding. I want to get out of here - now, ok.
JUNIOR=>I hope you enjoyed your visit.
MARK=>Uh yes, thank you. It was quite enjoyable.
JUNIOR=>Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
JUNIOR=>They seemed, closing by much
MARK=>Tony and China?
JUNIOR=>Vell. Goodnight.
SARAH=>Then why do you still like her?
MARK=>Like her? I don't know if I ever liked her. It's just you want what you can't get.
SARAH=>I know what you mean.
MRS WEBSTER=>Hello?
JONATHAN=>Hello, Mrs. Webster. Is China there?

MAID=>Quien es?
MARK=>Are you finished?
MAID=>Yes. But you know my English. It's not so good.
MARK=>No no, that's ok. Great, footnotes and everything. You are an angel.
GEMMA=>Mark, maybe she had another party to go to.
JAMES=>More like a motel to go to, you know China.
MARK=>No, no James, it's not like that. Tony and China, they're just friends.
SARAH=>That's not what you said last night.
MARK=>Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
SARAH=>A little?
JAMES=>I still vote for the motel.
MARK=>No.
MARK=>And now, another two INSPECTOR ROBERTS And you're telling me that they've been kidnapped. And boiled in wax?
MARK=>All I know is that there is something going on in that Waxworks.
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Now come on kid. You can give me a better story than that.
MARK=>I told you everything that I know yes!
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Good.
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Weird and tiny huh?
MR LINCOLN=>Hi
MR LINCOLN=>Yes of course. Why?
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Mmm-huh.
MARK=>You going to swallow that shit?
MARK=>What? Oh come on I don't believe this.
MR LINCOLN=>Of course you can feel free to wander around if you wish.
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>It would be a pleasure
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>You - stay here. MARK I want to show you a waxwork that.
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>SIT!
MR LINCOLN=>Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Hmm.
MR LINCOLN=>Would you like a closer look?
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Yes, I guess you're right
MR LINCOLN=>Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>No. Really, I must be going.
MARK=>You're going to fall for that?
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>What else do you want me to do? This isn't Russia you know.
MARK=>That's it.
LECTURER=>Never. Never underestimate the political significance of Mein Kampf as literature.
MARK=>Sorry I'm late sir. I'm so sick I'm... I don't know what's wrong with me
MARK=>Come on!
SARAH=>You aren't sick! We've got to get back. What are you doing!

INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>First I want to see if I'm imagining things.
PLAIN CLOTHES COP=>Feeling all right?
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>I'll letcha know.
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Shit.

SARAH=>Who's is all this?
MARK=>Sarah? Come over here
SARAH=>Well?
MARK=>Well. .this, is Mr. Lincoln. And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
MARK=>I don't know. But I know where we can find out.
PROFESSOR=>Come on Nigel, just don't stand there, give me a hand.
PROFESSOR=>Come on Nigel.
GIRL=>Help the Professor darling.
PROFESSOR=>It's a curse.
PROFESSOR=>Good heavens. It's the mummy.
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Shit! Let's get the hell out of here!

INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>There's a lever around here someplace!
GIRL=>Oh my goodness.
PROFESSOR=>Yes... my bag. on the other side of the tomb.
SIR WILFRED=>Hello Mark! Sit down here fellow sit down! I am.
MARK=>Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton. This is Sir Wilfred.
SIR WILFRED=>Hi there Sarah
SARAH=>Hello
MARK=>No thank you sir we're fine.
SIR WILFRED=>So Mark, what's so urgent?
MARK=>Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share. I love them
MARK=>I think Sarah should start.
SARAH=>Well, it all started when a friend and I
MARK=>China
MARK=>Well?
SIR WILFRED=>Well divide 18 into three
MARK=>Six six and six
MARK=>Who is this Mr. Lincoln?
SIR WILFRED=>If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
MARK=>Sell my soul?
SIR WILFRED=>Any student of Black Magic can do it. .most of these books will tell you how!
SARAH=>So what happens when you've sold out?
SIR WILFRED=>You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
MARK=>Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales. Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil. I think that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it. There's a voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
MARK=>Can this be stopped?
SIR WILFRED=>Maybe before the event, never after.
SARAH=>What can we do?
MARK=>But.. SIR WILFRED You must go now!
MARK=>Come on Sarah
MARK=>Thank you Sir Wilfred
SIR WILFRED=>Good luck
SIR WILFRED=>Tell the others our Mr. Lincoln has been found. It has begun.
SARAH=>Why can't we just burn it down from the outside?
MARK=>Let's find our way around back.
MARK=>Be careful. I can't see a damn thing.
MARK=>Don't worry, it's only wax. There's a light switch.
MARK=>Sar.
MARK=>Sarah, come on!
MARK=>Sarah?
JUNIOR=>Bravo!
PRINCE=>To a divine lunch Marquis

JUNIOR=>Grab him!
PRINCE=>Then why you stop Marquis? Beat her more.
MARQUIS DE SADE=>As your highness wishes.
MARQUIS DE SADE=>Now, my pretty rose; you die.
SARAH=>I don't want to leave. Don't let him take me.
MARK=>Sarah listen to me.
SARAH=>Go away.
MARQUIS DE SADE=>Your friend, has quite an imagination

PLANT=>Feed me!
SIR WILFRED=>Tally-ho!
MARQUIS=>Damn!
MARQUIS DE SADE=>Now we shall see, who is the real man.
MARQUIS DE SADE=>School time's over. Now you die.
MARK=>One last thing before you kill us Lincoln.
MR LINCOLN=>You know my name.
MARK=>I should. You murdered my grandfather.
MR LINCOLN=>Somebody has to. See you in hell.
SIR WILFRED=>Don't worry about me young people, save yourselves!
INSPECTOR ROBERTS=>Help!
