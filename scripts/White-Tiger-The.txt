PINKY MADAM=>Maharaja, sing for me!
PINKY MADAM=>You’re worried, haha.
BALRAM=>Today, I’m a celebrated entrepreneur in Bangalore - the Silicon Valley of India. They say it’s named after a Silicon Valley in “America,” but I find that hard to believe. I think we can agree that America is so “yesterday.” India and China are so “tomorrow.”
BALRAM=>My sly old granny Kusum.
ASHOK=>Hey, what’s up?
SAKET BAHADUR=>I hope you like carpets.
KISHAN=>Are you serious?
THE GREAT SOCIALIST=>Son! Come here, son. Come on.
MUKESH=>Driver, get lost.
ASHOK=>Honey, please -
BALRAM=>... Don’t we all.
BALRAM=>Rich men are born with opportunities they can waste. But a poor man...?
PINKY MADAM=>Ugh, sorry about that.
PINKY MADAM=>PINKY MADAM
ASHOK=>Not this again.
ASHOK=>She’s the boss.
MUKESH=>Balram, come in.
BALRAM=>No, sir, I can’t.
MUKESH=>It’s good right?
BALRAM=>BALRAM
BALRAM=>With Pinky Madam gone...
ASHOK=>It is my fault.
ASHOK=>Yes... go ahead.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST=>Oh that’s very sweet of you.
ASHOK=>It seems fine.
BALRAM=>BALRAM
BALRAM=>Enjoy India, sir.
