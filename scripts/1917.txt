SERGEANT SANDERS=>Now listen, Erinmore is inside, so tidy yourselves up.
SERGEANT SANDERS=>You never know - might be mentions in dispatches for this one, if you don’t bugger it up.
SERGEANT SANDERS=>Lance Corporals Blake and Schofield, Sir.
GENERAL ERINMORE=>Which one of you is Blake?
ERINMORE=>Germans have gone.
ERINMORE=>Come round here, Gentlemen.
ERINMORE=>If you don’t, it will be a massacre. We would lose two battalions. Sixteen hundred men, your brother among them.
LIEUTENANT GORDON=>Leave immediately, take this trench west, up on Sauchiehall Street, then north west on Paradise Alley at the front. Continue along the front line until you find the Yorks.
SCHOFIELD=>Sir, is it just us?
ERINMORE=>ERINMORE
PRIVATE STOKES=>Here, watch who you’re shoving.
BLAKE=>Let me through.
BLAKE=>Lieutenant Leslie, Sir?
LIEUTENANT LESLIE LIEUTENANT LESLIE=>One slow night, and the brass think the Hun have just gone home.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE=>But, chin up. There’s a medal in it for sure. Nothing like a scrap of ribbon to cheer up a widow.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE=>There’s a gap directly behind them. Useful, because if it’s dark you follow the stench. When you get to the second wire, look out for the bowing chap. There’s small break just beside him.
SCHOFIELD=>Don’t have any, Sir.
BLAKE=>Stop. It’s a mineshaft.
BLAKE=>Dirty bastards.
SCHOFIELD=>Heading back home.
SCHOFIELD=>I didn’t lose mine.
BLAKE=>Why do you not?
BLAKE=>They got him...
SCHOFIELD=>Just beyond Ecoust.
CAPTAIN SMITH=>We’re passing through Ecoust. We can take you some of the way.
PRIVATE COOKE=>Go on then Jondalar, give it a go, let’s see it!
SEPOY JONDALAR=>So, where are you going?
PRIVATE ROSSI=>So now it’s down to you.
SCHOFIELD SCHOFIELD=>In a Sieve they went to sea: In spite of all their friends could say, On a winter’s morn, on a stormy day, In a Sieve they went to sea.”
PRIVATE MULLER=>Wo ist der Brandy? Du kleiner Scheisser.. wehe du bist damit fortgelaufen.
SCHOFIELD=>You’re the Devons.
LIEUTENANT HUTTON=>B Company, stand to! Now listen, and listen well!
LIEUTENANT HUTTON=>Now I want us up there quickly, you understand? Do you understand!
COLONEL MACKENZIE=>I have heard it all before. I’m not going to wait until dusk, or for fog. I’m not calling back my men, only to send them out there again tomorrow. Not when we’ve got the bastards on the run. This is their last stand.
SCHOFIELD=>It was very quick.
