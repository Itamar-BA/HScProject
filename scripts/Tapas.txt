AT THE HIGHWAY=>ENGLISH PHIL stands, thumb outstretched. A CARAVAN OF DEUX CHEVAUX CARS passes him by. The bourgeois FRENCH TOURISTS within ignore him.
UNDER THE HIGHWAY BRIDGE=>ENGLISH PHIL huddles, hiding. A HORDE of MOSQUITOS engulfs him. He swats at them, swearing. But sees they come from a STREAM. A MOMENT LATER - AT THE STREAM Holding his deteriorating, pointy-toed shoes in one hand, he studies the map, while he bathes his blistered feet in the water. Spotting something on the map, he snaps to with a decision, wading out of the stream toward a donkey track.
ON THE DONKEY TRACK=>ENGLISH PHIL looks at his map, continues to limp forward. UP AHEAD - ON A MOUNTAIN TOP - CASTLE RUINS ENGLISH PHIL squints at this. TIGHT CLOSE UP ON THE MAP A tiny notation: "RUINED CASTLE." ENGLISH PHIL marches forward, determined. DUST BLOWS.
GOES COMPLETELY SILENT.=>ENGLISH PHIL walks by. Everyone, human and animal, STARES. Unnerved, he hobbles up the street. The CHILDREN and the DOGS silently follow. The DONKEY trails behind. UP AHEAD - A SIGN: "BAR PEPE" Ignoring his entourage, ENGLISH PHIL heads for it.
PHIL.=>He turns back to his beer and spots them. Pulls on his boots and hobbles out, still holding his beer. We -- and DON PEPE and JOSE MARIA -- can see KLAUS, JEAN-MICHEL, and ENGLISH PHIL argue silently, as they pass around the lone beer. Finishing the beer and continuing the argument, they disappear out of frame as they go down onto the street. DON PEPE and JOSE MARIA look at each other. And go to the window to see more.
ENGLISH PHIL=>The bullion truck gets here at five o'clock. We've plenty of time.
KLAUS=>Death to Franco!
DOWN THE STREET=>ENGLISH PHIL gives one last look back at the BAR PEPE, before he and his friends disappear again around a corner.
SHOWDOWN MUSIC BEGINS. ANGLE ON THE BANK.=>ANGLE ON KLAUS - who checks his watch, tips out the last cigarette from the pack, sighs, lighting it.
THE MUSIC INTENSIFIES.=>JEAN-MICHEL rises. The THREE REVOLUTIONARIES converge. CRANE UP to reveal JOSE MARIA, the GUARDIA CIVIL, DON PEPE, and the TOWN PRIEST on the CHURCH ROOF overlooking the square. As ENGLISH PHIL limps resolutely toward his Destiny, RAFAELA appears behind him, hurrying after, carrying a WICKER BASKET FULL OF SHOPPING.
RAFAELA=>¡Oye! ¡Companero!
APART.=>He looks down as RAFAELA comes up and grabs his arm. She follows his look and GASPS. His socks, worn to tatters, reveal a BLOODY MESS OF BLISTERS.
ENGLISH PHIL=>I don't go in for that old-fashioned macho bullshit, personally.
RAFAELA=>Next to my house.
ENGLISH PHIL=>Let me walk you home.
ROTTEN FISH.=>The TWO GUARDIA CIVIL drive up the ravine in a PICK-UP, blasting RAFAELA and ENGLISH PHIL with the BULLHORN. RAFAELA gives up on the GUN and goes to meet them. As ENGLISH PHIL watches, she gestures wildly, scolding the TWO POLICEMEN. They look back at her, sulky. And drive away. He climbs onto the refuse pile, digging at the smelly pile.
ENGLISH PHIL=>That's a good story.
RAFAELA=>You stay with us. They can't say anything if you're courting me, can they. I mean, as a --
ENGLISH PHIL=>Cover story. It's a good plan.
RAFAELA=>It's a good plan.
MORE FERVENTLY BACK.=>They look at each other. And, holding hands, turn and hurry away. AT JOSE MARIA, DON PEPE AND THE GUARDIA CIVIL Watching as RAFAELA and ENGLISH PHIL scramble away.
ENGLISH PHIL. FLASH FORWARD=>He offers the FAT CAT his own food to eat. The FAT CAT looks at him admiringly. ENGLISH PHIL holds forth, reading to the FAT CAT from KARL MARX as the FAT CAT eats.
MARAVILLA'S VOICE=>His and his friends' goal had been the
MARAVILLA'S VOICE=>The police were still looking for him, he said. And Interpol. And the FBI.
FRIENDS OF DON PEPE=>¡Es un BUMP! ¡Mira, el BUMP!
PHIL WASHES GLASSES.=>RAFAELA gives the window one last dusting, sees the OLD WOMEN.
OPENING.=>NO ONE OUTSIDE MOVES.
GRAND OPENING! CERVEZA LIBRE!=>Free beer for the first fifty customers! RAFAELA looks at him, then repeats it in SPANISH. GENERAL STAMPEDE into the bar.
TWO HOURS LATER=>The BAR is FULL. RAFAELA bustles back and forth, serving beer and tapas, collecting cash. ENGLISH PHIL welcomes customers, escorts them to tables.
ENGLISH PHIL=>Of course it will work!
JOSE MARIA=>We'll talk English, huh? It's good for me. My English has got much better.
ENGLISH PHIL=>It's hypertension! I know it is! I keep telling her, you eat too much salt!
JOSE MARIA=>I'll do what I can.
ENGLISH PHIL=>But that was my idea!
PULL BACK TO REVEAL=>KLAUS, RAFA, and ENGLISH PHIL in ridiculous WILD WEST OUTFITS. They enter into an awkwardly staged COWBOY FIGHT. JOSE MARIA, smoking a cigar, watches.
BANK.=>She goes to the door and looks out.
RAFAELA=>So go back there.
JOSE MARIA=>What have you done to her?
RAFAELA=>I'm getting old.
STAGECOACH.=>It dashes up to the water trough. And STOPS. As ENGLISH PHIL watches with amazement, the DOORS OPEN. And out step the AMAZING HEI-SEI MONDO BROTHERS, MACBETH and HAMLET.
JAPANESE PERFORMANCE ARTISTS EXTRAORDINAIRE.=>Both are in FULL COWBOY REGALIA. Gleaming white leather chaps. Western shirts, bolo ties, alligator boots, ten gallon hats. Each carries a CARPET BAG. CAMERAS hang around their necks. They look around themselves, talking in rapid JAPANESE. As ENGLISH PHIL watches, they take PICTURES OF EACH OTHER. They spot ENGLISH PHIL, who still wears his WESTERN COSTUME. They confer in low tones, and approach him, smiling.
A MOMENT LATER=>MACBETH takes a PHOTO OF ENGLISH PHIL AND HAMLET.
A MOMENT LATER=>HAMLET takes the PHOTO.
A MOMENT LATER=>ENGLISH PHIL snaps the PHOTO. HAMLET and MACBETH shake hands with him in enthusiastic thanks.
HAMLET=>Excuse me! Wait! MACBETH
OUTCROPPING.=>Silence. After a moment --
THROUGH THE STREETS=>TOWNSPEOPLE and TOURISTS make their way to the TOWN CENTER.
MARAVILLA'S VOICEOVER=>People NEVER like something new.
TRANSPARENT SCRIM.=>CURIOUS TOWNSPEOPLE move in towards the makeshift BLEACHERS. SAME - LATER The CROWD waits, expectant. RAFAELA sits in a corner of the bleachers. ENGLISH PHIL, KLAUS, and RAFA appear on stage to announce the show.
AT RAFAELA=>JOSE MARIA slides onto the seat beside her, hands over MARAVILLA, who now holds a stuffed animal, a pinwheel, a candy bar, and a bouquet of plastic flowers.
ON STAGE=>HAMLET AND MACBETH PERFORM THEIR ASTOUNDING ACT. -- First, they mournfully intone a SPEECH IN JAPANESE. -- then, strip down to SUMO WRESTLER STRIPS OF CLOTH. -- still singsonging in JAPANESE, they RUB EACH OTHER WITH OIL. -- MACBETH wraps HAMLET in STICKY WRAPPING TAPE and then ... -- holding one end of the tape, he UNRAVELS IT FAST, as HAMLET dances, YELPING WITH PAIN. -- ANOTHER SPEECH TO THE STUNNED AUDIENCE -- and MACBETH bends over, hits his rear end invitingly. -- HAMLET takes DARTS from his CARPET BAG and THROWS THEM AT
MACBETH'S BEHIND.=>-- HAMLET AND MACBETH YANK OUT THE DARTS. And BOW. NO APPLAUSE. Absolutely NO APPLAUSE. And the PIECE DE RESISTANCE: THE SCRIM GOES DOWN, LIT FROM BEHIND. HAMLET and MACBETH, projected on the scrim, unwrap their SUMO CLOTHS. They dance naked behind the screen. And then, making a shadow PUNCHING BAG of HAMLET'S GENITALS, MACBETH lies on his back and PRETENDS TO PUNCH AT THEM.
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE=>Shock. FAINTING MEN. SHOUTING WOMEN. The PRIEST gasps, unable to talk, clutching at his collar.
ANGLE ON RAFAELA=>She puts her hands over MARAVILLA'S EYES. But she herself is HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER.
ANGLE ON THE STAGE=>TOWNSPEOPLE rush the stage, led by OUTRAGED WOMEN. GENERAL MELEE.
THE SKY.=>As they go, JOSE MARIA drives up in a new model MERCEDES.
IN THE WALLED GARDEN=>A YOUNG TOUGH shows her an OLD MOTOR SCOOTER. Through a window - his OLD FATHER WATCHES FOOTBALL FROM HIS
WHEELCHAIR.=>MARAVILLA prowls around the SCOOTER. Holds up ten fingers. The TOUGH snorts. Pushes the HORN to show the scooter's style. MARAVILLA shrugs. He pretends to shoo her away. Then writes a figure in the dirt. She feigns shock, shrugs again, turns to go. Heads for the gate. Holds her breath. At the last minute, the TOUGH calls her back. RELIEF shows on her face.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL=>An older RAFAELA. More matronly, more self-confident, still beautiful. The RICH WOMAN exits as MARAVILLA enters. MARAVILLA reaches for a TAPA from a passing tray. RAFAELA slaps her hand. MARAVILLA surveys the room with approval.
AT ENGLISH PHIL'S WORKSHOP=>A HANDMADE SIGN: REPARACION DE PANELES DE ENERGIA SOLAR.
POWERED BICYCLE.=>RAFAELA enters. No sign of ENGLISH PHIL. She goes out.
OF CHAMPAGNE.=>He spots a JAGUAR with the KEYS inside it. Looks around. No one can see him. On impulse, he HOPS in the car, and TAKES IT FOR A
JOYRIDE IN THE DESERT.=>PULL UP -- to RAFAELA and ENGLISH PHIL in the FIG TREE THICKET. Below them, we can see SMOKE POURING OUT OF JOSE MARIA'S BATHROOM WINDOW. And KLAUS driving the JAGUAR in figure eights in the DESERT.
EXPRESSIONS OF ESTEEM.=>ENGLISH PHIL hurries over to a dazed RAFAELA.
ENGLISH PHIL=>My friends will come.
HE BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.=>She GRABS him and STICKS HER TONGUE IN HIS MOUTH. He PUSHES her away.
OF THE DESERT."=>A BUSLOAD OF JAPANESE TOURISTS unloads, pays at the turnstile. KLAUS meets them, holding a POLECAT SKIN.
OF A WILD BOAR.=>ENGLISH PHIL lectures in Spanish to a GROUP OF YAWNING
SCHOOLCHILDREN.=>CHURCH BELLS RING ABOVE THE RAVINE.
MUSICA! DINERO! Y ALEGRIA!=>Action! Loud noises! Bright colors! A BASS BEAT pounds loudly onto the street.
BROTHERS=>T-SHIRT. She goes out the front door.
RAFAELA.=>All the DOORS onto the street are OPEN. As he walks, alone, down the street, the DOORS SLAM ONE BY ONE. When he reaches the PLAZA, he sees a STATUE. Many MULTI-COLORED PIGEONS fly around it. He approaches it. It is a LARGER THAN LIFE STATUE OF A BEAMING JOSE MARIA. His feet rest on a PEDESTAL made of CURRENCY SIGNS. And a banner across his chest says: "MUSIC, MONEY, FUN!" POUNDING MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY --
GLOSSY CARS.=>The LIMO flies TINY ARGENTINIAN FLAGS. TV CAMERAMEN hang out of windows of the cars. The CONVOY heads for town.
APPARITION.=>The CONVOY stops in front of the BAR RAFAELA. RAFA gapes from the terrace. And, as curious TOWNSPEOPLE gather, he takes off down the street.
ARGENTINIAN.=>He TASTES it. He points to another selection. RAFAELA serves that. He tastes. And another. He looks wordlessly at the THREE GOURMANDS. They taste what RAFAELA puts before them. All look at each other, apparently overcome. The ARGENTINIAN stands, taking off his sunglasses. HIS EYES ARE FILLED WITH EMOTION.
SILENCE.=>And then -- WILD REJOICING! ENGLISH PHIL and RAFAELA turn toward each other.
RAFAELA=>You told me, Phil!
"TAPAS FAMOSAS."=>Only the BAR RAFAELA remains the BAR RAFAELA. The STREET is bustling.
PASTELS.=>ENGLISH PHIL emerges, in dirty work clothes, gets into a TRUCK filled with trash, old paint cans, etc., and drives off.
AT THE CITROEN=>The THREE YOUNG MEN block the road, stopping ENGLISH PHIL. They get into the truck. INT. THE TRUCK ENGLISH PHIL notes their wild eyes, their sweating, their tatoos, shaved heads, nose rings, etc, as they pile in and look at him threateningly.
ENGLISH PHIL=>didn't stand a chance! We couldn't get
STAGECOACH.=>ENGLISH PHIL, apparently bored with this VISION, shakes his head with disgust, and walks on. The STAGECOACH comes alongside.
ENGLISH PHIL=>We'll go to bed early. You know you always feel better after the second time.
ENGLISH PHIL=>I'll get the ambulance. As he goes out, RAFAELA calls out.
AT THE BED=>ENGLISH PHIL climbs into bed with RAFAELA and GRASPS HER TIGHTLY IN HIS ARMS.
AT THE TELEPHONE=>ENGLISH PHIL picks up the PHONE.
MARAVILLA'S VOICE=>Of course, I came back home.
AT THE RENTAL CAR=>A beautiful, impeccably dressed, no-nonsense BUSINESSWOMAN wearing sunglasses gets out, and heads for the terrace.
MARAVILLA=>Where's my father?
YOUNG WOMAN=>[He is a GREAT MAN!]
PRIEST=>Never heard of him.
PRIEST=>[My friends...]
CARVED SCROLL: "TAPAS FAMOSAS."=>ENGLISH PHIL looks up at it, expressionless. Pause. Then, he turns to the crowd.
MARAVILLA=>You look the same.
ENGLISH PHIL=>Don't be ridiculous! Of course I was. I STILL am. Proud of it, too.
AT THE STATUE=>ENGLISH PHIL, RAFAELA'S GHOST, and RAFAELITA go on having their talk
