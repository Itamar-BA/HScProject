VINCE=>Ethan... Rankin?
ETHAN=>Vince?
VINCE=>How are you?
ETHAN=>You?
VINCE=>Weak, spacey.
VINCE=>Ethan?
ETHAN=>Oh, Jesus, oh my God...
FRIEND=>Russ, where you going?
RUSSELL=>I've got to go! Something's wrong!
FRIEND=>Where?
RUSSELL=>I don't know.
FRIEND=>Chill, come on, we'll go someplace.
RUSSELL=>No, I've got to go home.
FRIEND=>Home?
RUSSELL=>I need to get to Portland, Oregon, US, on the next flight possible, the next connection.
CLERK=>There wouldn't be anything until morning. Six o'clock.
RUSSELL=>Put me on it. I have cash.
CLERK=>Do you have a passport?
RUSSELL=>Right here. Family emergency.
HUME=>...I've been through this with each of you individually, but now, collectively, we have the joint opportunity to air any concerns or anxieties. This DMT -- dimethyltryptamine -- trial is the first such study to be approved by the FDA, so forgive us if we err on the side of caution. We have chosen DMT as the pioneer psychotropic compound for several reasons: it naturally occurs in the body, evident in such states as schizophrenia and manic depression. To the extent that we can understand why Serotonin is affected by DMT, we might unlock some of the mysteries for such disabling disorders. Second, it is an intense drug. The visions will be strong. Third, it's short acting. It's in and out fast. Should anyone have an unpleasant experience, at least it will be over quickly. All of you have previous experiences with psychedelic drugs, some extensive experience. This will be a much more controlled environment. 1.0 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine will be injected intramuscularly, not smoked as is the usual practice. This retards the speed at which the drug becomes effective, but it's the only way to be sure everyone receives the same dosage. You've all signed the informed consent forms, but I wanted to take this opportunity to invite your friends and relatives to an open forum. If anyone has any questions, please ask. If anyone has second thoughts about being a trial subject, you may withdraw your consent at any time. Questions?
HUME=>Yes?
GIRLFRIEND=>Dr. Rankin...
HUME=>Hugh.
GIRLFRIEND=>Have you taken dimetheltrimethitripo... ...DMT?
HUME=>Since 1970 dimethyltryptamine, along with virtually every other hallucinogen, has been a Schedule I drug, meaning that any unauthorized use is a crime. I do not break the law. But yes, I have taken DMT, inhaled and intramuscular, outside the country and in legally approved situations. Is it dangerous? Only if you fear death by astonishment. Because you will be astonished. I have zero qualms about administering or using this substance.
OLDER MAN=>There are those, and I'm not one of them, who say this program is just an excuse for recreational drug use.
HUME=>I don't like the word "recreational." It implies something trivial. Vision- inducing plants are functional, and have been for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. They teach us about ourselves. A DMT voyage, like any trip, is instructional. You will return knowing more about the world around you and the world inside you. The purpose of the trial is not recreational, it is scientific.
HUME=>What do you think?
VINCE=>You mean were there any "spies," members of Fifth Estate? No, it was cool. You did good.
HUME=>Thanks, Vince.
VINCE=>It's such a delicate balance. You want to be open and candid -- we have nothing to hide; on the other hand, we all know the devastating effects too much publicity have had on this type of research. I particularly liked the line about not breaking the law.
VINCE=>When do you start?
HUME=>Monday. You going to be there for the first trials?
VINCE=>What time?
HUME=>Ten a.m. At the clinic.
VINCE=>Okay. Again, good work.
HUME=>Russ, is that you? Russell?
HUME=>Jeez, six months without a boo or a bah, now -- it's great to see you. What's going on?
RUSSELL=>I just felt... I wanted to come home.
HUME=>Well, come in. Meet Allison... I guess she's not home yet. Come on in. You want a beer or a soda or anything?
RUSSELL=>Water. I'm thirsty from the plane.
HUME=>Okay, brother, com'on, out with it. What happened?
RUSSELL=>It's hard to explain.
HUME=>Are you in trouble?
RUSSELL=>No. I was in a club the other night, well, last night, in Mexico City, that's where I've been living, getting into Indian culture and all that and I got this feeling, this very strong feeling, that something was wrong. That someone was in danger --
HUME=>You had a panic attack.
RUSSELL=>I had a premonition. Is Mom all right?
HUME=>You should have called.
RUSSELL=>I wanted to see her. Is she all right?
HUME=>You all right?
HUME=>There may be a reoccurrence of the cancer. In her lungs.
RUSSELL=>Let's go see her.
HUME=>I'll call. We'll drop by tomorrow.
RUSSELL=>We could go now.
HUME=>Tomorrow afternoon. I've got to have some time to prepare her. You two didn't exactly leave on the best of terms. You need some rest. And a shave.
EVANGELINE=>More coffee?
HUME=>No, Mom, I'm fine.
RUSSELL=>Me too.
EVANGELINE=>It's from Kona. The coffee.
RUSSELL=>Delicious.
HUME=>Were you out this morning, power- walking?
EVANGELINE=>Yes, with Judy, but these days it's more walk than power. In fact, we turned back after fifteen minutes.
EVANGELINE=>Are you planning to stay long?
RUSSELL=>A couple of days at least. We'll see what happens. It's good to see you.
HUME=>I gotta go see a man about a dog.
EVANGELINE=>You were in Mexico City? The American University?
RUSSELL=>Well, it isn't a school in the formal sense. It's a group of young scholars with sympathetic interests --
EVANGELINE=>Like a commune?
RUSSELL=>We wouldn't use that term.
EVANGELINE=>And these sympathetic interests, what are they?
RUSSELL=>Indigenous American cultures. Pre- Columbian societies. Tribal organizations, tribal rites --
EVANGELINE=>You mean peyote. You're talking about peyote, right? Oh my God.
RUSSELL=>It's nothing to be ashamed of. What do you think Hume does at the University, at the clinic?
EVANGELINE=>He's a bio-chemist.
RUSSELL=>He does drug research.
EVANGELINE=>He has a Ph.D.
EVANGELINE=>Everything that has gone wrong with this family can be traced directly back to drugs.
RUSSELL=>Mom, stop. Just stop.
EVANGELINE=>Drugs have been the death of this family.
RUSSELL=>No wonder Dad left you. Jesus Christ. Tell me, has he ever been in touch with you in, what, twenty years?
EVANGELINE=>He hasn't changed. He's always looking for trouble, he goes to jail --
HUME=>Mom, it was petty larceny --
EVANGELINE=>And drugs.
HUME=>He was never in jail. He was on probation.
EVANGELINE=>Every time I see him I see his father.
RUSSELL=>That's it. I don't blame him.
RUSSELL=>She lives in worst case scenario- land.
HUME=>Mom, I'll call you.
RUSSELL=>I don't know why I came back. What was I thinking? It was a bad idea.
HUME=>Russ.
RUSSELL=>Asshole! Why don't you look were the fuck you're going?
ALLISON=>...I was trying to teach my students about life. I said to them, "The only way you can be sure you are loved for yourself and not for money or sex, is if you are unattractive and poor." But then I explained it's very hard to be loved if you are like that.
RUSSELL=>That makes love practically impossible.
ALLISON=>They need to know what they're up against.
ALLISON=>Hume's talked about you a lot, and I have to say, I haven't been disappointed.
RUSSELL=>Yeah, I really fucked up today.
ALLISON=>You should go back, not tomorrow, but soon, and apologize.
RUSSELL=>That's one point of view.
ALLISON=>Yes. Mine.
ALLISON=>Hume doesn't approve of artificially enhanced nicotine.
HUME=>One makes certain concessions for love.
ALLISON=>You want one?
RUSSELL=>Nah. But you know, of course, marijuana is also carcinogenic.
HUME=>Well...
HUME=>Here, let us help you.
RUSSELL=>To be honest, I'd sort of come to the end of my interest in mescaline. Mostly just getting stoned.
HUME=>That's what you were doing in that club? When you had the panic attack?
RUSSELL=>Not really.
HUME=>MDMA.
RUSSELL=>Yep.
HUME=>It's an interesting drug. There's important work being done on Ecstacy at John Hopkins, in Barcelona: neuroendocrine effects, vasopressin secretion...
RUSSELL=>What are you into?
HUME=>We're starting a trial on DMT.
RUSSELL=>The harmalines? Hoo boy. The heavy stuff. How you get away with that?
HUME=>Cause I'm a good boy.
RUSSELL=>How can you put up with it? All the shit you have to deal with in this country?
HUME=>Somebody's got to stay and fight the good fight. The best labs are here, the best scientists are here -- you do work in this country and the scientific community has to take it seriously. Besides, with the internet, everybody is connected now. You know the organization MAPS? Through MAPS now we're in constant contact with research all around the world: Spain, Finland, Brazil. It's not like it used to be.
RUSSELL=>Good old Hume Rankin.
HUME=>Don't mock me bro.
RUSSELL=>Excuse-moi.
HUME=>Things are going to change. It's too important not to change.
RUSSELL=>Psilocybin, that's where I realized I wanted to be, but I just wasn't... well, I just I was scared. The big drugs, the See God drugs, that's what it's all about.
HUME=>This extraordinary imagery we all have within us. These things, unworldly things, that just appear. Where do they come from? What are they trying to say?
RUSSELL=>The old dilemma. You open those doors of perception, what happens? Do you see this world more clearly or do you come in contact with another world?
HUME=>Does the inside come out or does the Outside come in?
RUSSELL=>The Freud/Jung dilemma.
HUME=>It's not politically correct, and I'll deny I've said this if you repeat it, but I believe there's a parallel world of awareness that these plants give us access to. It may be the way primitive man first became aware of the spiritual world.
RUSSELL=>"Jesus was a plant."
HUME=>I deny it. I never said that.
RUSSELL=>So, this DMT trial, you got everyone signed up? You can't fit one more in?
HUME=>Why?
RUSSELL=>You got a bunch of Portland Deadheads signed up for this trial and you're going to interview them silly. Wouldn't it be better to have one subject who has studied psychotropic affect, who's personal history is intimately conjoined with your own, someone with whom you can truly discuss the results of the trip?
HUME=>You want in?
RUSSELL=>Can you swing it?
HUME=>Yeah. If you don't advertise.
RUSSELL=>Yes sir. Tell me one thing, Professor Rankin.
HUME=>What?
RUSSELL=>Do you, ah, offer Mileage Plus?
MANAGER=>We have an Advancement Program.
RUSSELL=>Not really, I'm between situations. I need short term employment. I don't want to be a burden on my friends.
MANAGER=>We have an investment in training you.
RUSSELL=>It's a counter position.
MANAGER=>This is a service-intensive occupation.
RUSSELL=>Mr. Banks, I've worked in the fast food business. I seek only to be a diligent employee. I understand customers.
RUSSELL=>Chuck around?
KORN SHIRT=>Chuck who?
RUSSELL=>Wistelm. "Chuckie Wisdom."
KORN SHIRT=>Oh yeah, Chuckie. No, nah, I don't know.
RUSSELL=>I used to hang here.
KORN SHIRT=>He got busted -- or maybe not, I'm not sure. That was before my time.
RUSSELL=>How long you been here?
KORN SHIRT=>Six weeks. You're Russ Rankin, right? I'm Joe. I came here, like before I had this, like job -- you're heavy, you were like a major dope dude huh? Hey, this is Russ Rankin.
RUSSELL=>My name's Bob.
FEMALE EMPLOYEE=>Yeah?
RUSSELL=>I was just looking for Chuckie Wisdom.
FEMALE EMPLOYEE=>Chuckie who?
RUSSELL=>Hey, it's nothing. Groove on.
FEMALE EMPLOYEE=>You find him, tell him I got some crabs of his.
RUSSELL=>And they wonder why people have bad trips?
HUME=>The setting isn't what it should be, but it's important to operate in a clinical environment. Anyway, the "set," the mind set, is more important than the physical setting.
RUSSELL=>No problem.
HUME=>We will, during the duration of the trial, approximately twenty minutes, draw blood at regular intervals as well as check pupil diameters -- none of which will effect your experience. If anything, it will provide a comforting connection to the real world of the clinic. Are there any questions?
HUME=>Relax your muscles, let the tension flow from your bodies and: pay attention.
RUSSELL'S VOICE=>It's falling away...
RUSSELL=>Mom.
RUSSELL=>Stop, stop.
HUME=>Russ?
RUSSELL=>We have to go to mother's house.
HUME=>We can't do that. You're not fully down yet. We'll go in a while.
RUSSELL=>No, we've got to go now.
RUSSELL=>I'll go on my own.
HUME=>No, no, I'll take you. Let's get your shirt.
RUSSELL=>Turn it off.
HUME=>What happened? What's this all about? You're just going to sit there? I mean, what can be so bad? You're not going to create a scene are you?
HUME=>Mom?
HUME=>Don't touch anything. It's a crime scene. Mother, Mom, Mom...
RUSSELL=>She's dead.
HUME=>Yes. I'm going to another room, call 911. Are you all right? I mean, to deal with the police and whatever. I could drive you home, come back and call.
RUSSELL=>No, I'm all right. I'm down. Go ahead and call. Hume?
HUME=>Yeah? Russell?
RUSSELL=>I saw it.
LAWRENCE=>...I'll be in touch tomorrow, Dr. Rankin, but you touched nothing?
HUME=>The front door, we walked here, here, there -- otherwise, nothing. I used the phone in the den.
RUSSELL=>We were here yesterday. That's why we came back. We had an argument.
HUME=>We came to see Mom and, well, you know, the usual parent-child stuff. We wanted to patch it up.
LAWRENCE=>That's why you were together?
HUME=>Yes.
LAWRENCE=>And your father?
HUME=>My father and my mother broke up twenty... one years ago. She hasn't seen him since.
LAWRENCE=>Where is he now?
HUME=>I don't know.
LAWRENCE=>Is there anything, you can think about it, was there anything unusual, anything that might give us a direction to pursue?
RUSSELL=>She was sick. She had lung cancer. She had a mastectomy, but the cancer returned.
LAWRENCE=>How is this relevant?
RUSSELL=>It isn't. But, I mean, what kind of person kills a dying woman?
RUSSELL=>The grass grew and it was like a forest, a jungle, there was a panther...
HUME=>Minute fourteen.
RUSSELL=>...the elves lead me out of the wood...
HUME=>There's a lot of literature on elves. Terry McKenna had a thing about them. Spirit escorts to the Other World.
RUSSELL=>There, there, it's starting. I see the saucer. I see the light. Blue light. She's there.
RUSSELL=>My God.
HUME=>Heart rate elevating. Blood pressure up.
RUSSELL=>She takes me to him. I can see him clearly. I see him in every detail.
RUSSELL=>He places her cross in my hand.
HUME=>Twenty-one minutes, EKG, blood pressure returning to normal.
ALLISON=>Wow.
RUSSELL=>I... do you believe me?
ALLISON=>Yes.
RUSSELL=>I'm going to bed.
ALLISON=>Do you believe him?
HUME=>Yes, I do, but...
ALLISON=>But what?
HUME=>I don't know what it means.
RUSSELL=>What do you mean, no new developments?
LAWRENCE=>Mr. Rankin, your mother's murder... occurred thirty-four hours ago. Believe me, this is a high profile crime. We are employing every resource at our disposal-the forensic results, a lot of it is still coming through.
RUSSELL=>But the evidence, witnesses, somebody must have seen something...
LAWRENCE=>We've canvassed the neighborhood, we're going back, re-interviewing -- gone out on the news shows, I'm sure you've seen them. When's the funeral?
RUSSELL=>Memorial service. Day after tomorrow.
LAWRENCE=>I spoke with your father.
RUSSELL=>Huh?
LAWRENCE=>In England. That's where he lives. I was going to have him interviewed there, but he's decided to return for the funeral.
LAWRENCE=>You mean he didn't tell you?
VINCE=>I've heard and read a thousand trip stories, I've been to a hundred conferences, but I've never heard anything like this. Glossolalia, time and space travel, hyperspace healing, eschatological hysteria, material transformation, phone calls to the dead, being devoured by giant cats -- but not this. Are you going to write it up?
HUME=>I haven't decided what to do. You're the first one I've told.
VINCE=>How's Russ?
HUME=>This whole thing has freaked him. Apart from that, he's fine. Hell, it's freaked me. It's hard to grieve properly with this other stuff hanging over our heads.
VINCE=>I understand. I wish I could put it in context for you.
HUME=>I know this is not something we discuss, but have you been in contact with my father?
VINCE=>No, why?
HUME=>The police located him. He's going to come back for the memorial service. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
VINCE=>Yes. These were once high-tech.
HUME=>And you've never heard from him, about him?
VINCE=>No, but thinking back, everything about your father was odd. There are two paradigms for work in this field. There are Huxleyites, who believe psychotropic drugs are for the prepared few. There are those like Tim Leary who are popularizers, who want everyone to turn on. I'm a Huxleyite, Ethan was a Learyist and he got terribly burned for it. Leary didn't mind when they turned him into a clown, in fact, he got off on it; but not Ethan. He couldn't stand the ridicule, the rejection, the cheapening of his ideas. He turned his back on the whole thing. I don't know what your mother told you, but I think this was underneath the problems Ethan and Evangeline were having.
ETHAN=>That was very moving. She was a good woman. Better than I deserved. I'm glad I came.
HUME=>I'm glad you did too. Dad.
ETHAN=>I can't say I've been much of a parent. I'm going back to Britain tonight.
RUSSELL=>Can't you stay a bit longer?
ETHAN=>I almost came back five, six years ago, but I did some checking. You're involved in psychedelics, aren't you?
HUME=>Um-hmm.
ETHAN=>I went to the library, looked you up. Read some of the articles you've written. How in God's name did you end up in that field? Tell me.
HUME=>Well, I was pre-med. I wanted to be a doctor, just like you. I got interested in brain function, how neurotransmitters react, why certain alkaloids effect the brain as they do, which then of course led to psychotropic drugs which led me here. Just like you.
ETHAN=>Psychedelics ruined my life and they'll ruin yours too. Ruined my reputation, ruined my marriage, ruined my self-esteem. I have a new life now and I want no contact with this one. Get out, Hume. Get out before it ruins your life. Maybe we'll meet again. We'll see.
HUME=>Wow.
RUSSELL=>Yeah, well, what do you expect from a man who names his sons after British philosophers?
RUSSELL=>I still see him. I can see him as clear as I see you.
HUME=>Who?
RUSSELL=>The murderer.
ALLISON=>The one inside the saucer?
RUSSELL=>Yeah.
RUSSELL=>I think we have to do something about it. What if he's a known psychopath? What if he's killing someone else in some other city right now?
HUME=>What do you propose?
RUSSELL=>Well, since I have the image so clear in my mind, we could go to the police, to Detective Lawrence. I'm sure they have a sketch artist, you know, a sketch kit, then they could take the murder's face, see if anybody recognizes him.
ALLISON=>But what if he's not the murderer? What if it's just somebody you saw somewhere and incorporated into you unconscious?
RUSSELL=>Well, then he'll have an alibi, right? Hume, I think this is a real person. We have a moral obligation to help catch him. We have an obligation to our mother.
HUME=>Okay, we'll do it. We'll call Lawrence in the morning. But we've got to have the story straight. Russ states the "official" version:
RUSSELL=>During the DMT trial I had a vision. I saw Mom bloody, I saw the murderer standing beside her, holding a bloody butcher knife. Afterwards, we went over to her house and found her dead.
HUME=>Don't tell him about the elves.
RUSSELL=>No.
HUME=>Whatever you do, don't tell him about the flying saucer.
RUSSELL=>No way.
RUSSELL=>I would say the eyes... show me some additional eye choices.
RUSSELL=>Now the skin color...
LAWRENCE=>You know that expression, "I've seen it all?" Remind me not to use it again. Thanks for coming by. I thought it would be good to go over it with both of you. Is this a good resemblance?
HUME=>I would have no idea. I was not "there."
RUSSELL=>It's very good. Almost exact.
LAWRENCE=>I'll pass it around, very discretely, of course, given the circumstances. See if it gets a hit. I don't think broad dissemination is well-advised. I checked with your department at the University. Everything about the drug trial is apparently on the up and up. There won't be any negative repercussions.
RUSSELL=>I think this is him. This is the killer. And he's real. I believe that, I can't tell you why.
LAWRENCE=>Why can't you tell me?
RUSSELL=>It's not that I won't tell you, it's just that my reasons are more intuitive than rational.
LAWRENCE=>I hope you're not planning on participating in any additional trials.
RUSSELL=>No, sir, I'm not.
LAWRENCE=>Okay, let me go through this again. This DMT trip. Let's back up to the point where you encounter the "self- transforming machine elves."
HUME=>You told him about the elves?
RUSSELL=>I had to. Otherwise it wouldn't make any sense. How else could I explain how I got to the saucer?
HUME=>You told him about the flying saucer?
RUSSELL=>Hume?
HUME=>Yeah?
RUSSELL=>You about done?
HUME=>Give me twenty minutes. I'll meet you downstairs in the snack shop.
HUME=>The police have unsealed Mom's house. We have to arrange the disposition of her possessions.
RUSSELL=>How's the trial going?
HUME=>Good.
RUSSELL=>No more freak-outs?
HUME=>No.
RUSSELL=>I've been thinking.
HUME=>No kidding. Me too.
RUSSELL=>The police aren't doing anything. I can't say I blame them, not after that fiasco with Detective Lawrence. I mean, we came off like a comedy team.
HUME=>You've spoken with Lawrence?
RUSSELL=>I don't have to. Murders like this are solved in seventy-two hours -- or not at all. Or at least not until the killer makes a mistake. It's been over a week. There's nothing in the papers, on the news.
HUME=>What makes me think you have something in mind? You want me to get a copy of the sketch? You want to circulate it privately?
RUSSELL=>No, not that.
HUME=>What then?
RUSSELL=>The murderer exists up here. So does, I imagine, his identity -- or at least, clues to his identity. There's only one way to access that information. That is to return to the scene of the identification. Learn more about him. To take another trip.
HUME=>There's no way Garwood would let you back into the trial.
RUSSELL=>I know. Besides, I don't want to trip at the Clinic. That setting is not good -- I'll do it at your place. I'll smoke the DMT, not inject it. Mix a little Syrian rue to extend it. That way the experience will be stronger, sharper.
HUME=>It's illegal.
RUSSELL=>Drug use is based on loss of control. Drug laws are created by those who are terrified by loss of control --
HUME=>You're preaching to the choir.
RUSSELL=>You're telling me you can't get DMT crystals? This is the Pacific Northwest, man. We're in the fucking epicenter of drug consciousness. You don't even have to go through the Clinic. Or I should get it on my own?
HUME=>What do you think will happen? When you trip?
RUSSELL=>I'm going back, Hume. He won't avoid me. You know how the hallucinatory mind works: you say the word "blue" and you see more shades of blue than you ever imagined. I'll call him, he'll appear -- and when I meet him, I'll find out more about him. Something we can use.
RUSSELL=>There's no other way.
HUME=>If you do it --
RUSSELL=>I am.
HUME=>I don't think you should do it alone. I'd have to come with you.
RUSSELL=>You want to meet him?
HUME=>I wouldn't mind.
RUSSELL=>Is that a yes?
HUME=>No.
RUSSELL=>But you'll think about it?
HUME=>I'll think about it.
HUME=>I'd hate to look at that and up in that trip. I opted to go without any carrier. That way the effect will be strongest and shortest. I think twenty minutes is more than enough.
HUME=>Is the designated driver ready?
ALLISON=>Why is it the boys get to have all the fun?
HUME=>If you make an object, you say it first, then I'll repeat it. Everything okay? Relaxed?
HUME=>Pay attention.
RUSSELL=>Elves. Transforming machine elves.
RUSSELL=>The saucer. Open the door.
RUSSELL=>Show yourself. I want to see you. Murderer. Murderer!
RUSSELL=>What is your name?
HUME=>Murderer, what is your name?
RUSSELL=>We need help. Somebody, please!
ORDERLY=>Everything is going to be all right.
NURSE=>We need some information about him.
JOURNALIST=>Isn't that... isn't that the Rankin boys, the ones whose mother was killed?
ALLISON=>...not allergic to any medications, Hume, Hume Rankin...
ALLISON=>Hi.
HUME=>I didn't hear you come in.
ALLISON=>How are you feeling?
HUME=>Sore.
ALLISON=>A few more days and you'll be able to go home.
HUME=>Non-life threatening wounds, but, Jesus, they hurt. Garwood visited yesterday.
ALLISON=>That was nice. What did he say?
HUME=>It was what he didn't say.
ALLISON=>What didn't he say?
HUME=>He's under pressure. The whole department is under scrutiny. I offered to resign but he turned me down.
ALLISON=>That's good.
HUME=>No, what it means is that it will look better for the University if they fire me.
ALLISON=>I visited Russell in jail.
HUME=>You hid the videotapes? How's he?
ALLISON=>Not good.
HUME=>God, what a mess.
ALLISON=>He's fallen inside himself. He's absolutely mortified.
HUME=>You told him I don't blame him?
ALLISON=>But that's not the problem. The problem is that he blames himself.
VANTIL=>We in the DA's office have been back and forth about this whole thing. I know I said some pretty strong things before, but we've reconsidered.
RUSSELL=>I haven't asked for leniency.
VANTIL=>I don't know if the District Attorney's office wants to prosecute the son of a recently murdered woman who's killer is still on the loose. Especially when there is no complainant, no reliable witnesses. No hard evidence. I've spoken with the judge. I'm going to propose community service and probation, providing you enter a court-administered program of therapy.
LAWRENCE=>Any infraction, any contact with illegal drugs, and you'll be right back in here.
RUSSELL=>My drug taking days are over. No more tripping for Russ Rankin.
LAWRENCE=>You were trying to catch your mother's murderer in hyperspace -- do you realize how crazy that sounds?
RUSSELL=>Yeah.
VANTIL=>We're going to get you some help.
RUSSELL=>Any developments in the murder investigation?
LAWRENCE=>No.
RUSSELL=>Nothing from the sketch?
LAWRENCE=>No.
RUSSELL=>You know what scares me the most, even more than stabbing my brother? It's the fear that this murderer is a product of my own projection. That I created him out of my own anger at my mother, that I took on his form and I killed her.
LAWRENCE=>It's fortunate you have such a good alibi at the time of her death.
RUSSELL=>Allison told me about the University. I'm so --
HUME=>Please, Russ, I said no more apologies. Just stop apologizing.
RUSSELL=>I can't.
HUME=>I can find another job, even if it's sorting specimens somewhere. Or real estate. What do you think? Think I'd make a good realtor? I know these guys who have started up a medical web site.
ALLISON=>That sounds good.
HUME=>Yeah, from hyperspace to cyberspace.
HUME=>Where did you find this? I'm going to lock it up.
HUME=>You're not going to get better watching that.
RUSSELL=>How am I going to get better?
RUSSELL=>Thanks, no.
RUSSELL=>This is where we were sitting.
ALLISON=>Who?
RUSSELL=>Me and Hume. We were sitting here, just like this, listening to the crickets, sipping wine. That's when I convinced him to let me in on the DMT trial. That's how it all started. If we could only go back... Look, ah during the trip?
ALLISON=>Yes?
RUSSELL=>Did you and I, did I... was there anything sexual?
ALLISON=>You were aroused. You touched me.
RUSSELL=>But?
ALLISON=>No. You thought we did?
RUSSELL=>The trip was very... sensual. You were part of it. Did you tell Hume? I wouldn't want him to think, you know, his brother and his girlfriend --
ALLISON=>Psychedelics have a strong sexual component. You know that.
RUSSELL=>I didn't have a sister. I've never understood women, what makes them tick. I don't even know what makes them shop.
ALLISON=>But it was good, right? It felt good?
RUSSELL=>This is supposed to help me?
ALLISON=>There's so much denial going on around here, I think somebody ought to tell the truth. I've never heard of therapy that claimed that denial was the doorway to health.
RUSSELL=>Yeah, it felt good. I took a puff, my arms and legs fell off, the floor gave way and the world opened up. Until, of course, the very end. That wasn't good at all.
ALLISON=>Well then, think about the good. Not the other.
RUSSELL=>Ally, I like you. I think you're fabulous, but I don't want you to think...
ALLISON=>I like you too. I love you. But it's Hume I want to give my life to. Why can't both things be true?
RUSSELL=>I was wondering...
ALLISON=>What?
RUSSELL=>Do you have any sisters?
ALLISON=>No, I'm the only one.
CHINDOY=>Dr. Rankin?
HUME=>Yes.
CHINDOY=>I'm Miguel Chindoy.
HUME=>Okay.
CHINDOY=>I've read about the events surrounding you and your brother. I've come to help. I have had twenty years of shamanic experience. I believe I can help.
HUME=>Excuse me, who told you to come here?
CHINDOY=>I am a shaman.
HUME=>I'm a scholar. What do you want?
CHINDOY=>I've come to offer my services. To help your brother through this difficult and necessary passage.
HUME=>Mr. Chindoy, thank you and fuck you. Or is that Senor Chindoy? So, Senor, get your ass back in your rental car and leave us alone.
CHINDOY=>Dr. Rankin.
VINCE=>"Miguel Chindoy." His real name is Michael Kamen. Born in Brooklyn, 1946. Poster child for burnout. Brilliant student, apparently, but then, arrested, discredited, etcetera. Eight fries short of a Happy Meal. We all talk the psychedelic talk, spiel the psychedelic evangelism, but there are people who are lost, destroyed. We don't like to admit it, but it's true.
HUME=>They keep trying to contact me. I've sent back my University mail, I changed my mail address, but this is the first time someone's tried to track me down.
VINCE=>I'm sorry about the way it came down. It was improper, inhumane, and I was part of it --
HUME=>You had to do what you had to do. I don't judge you.
VINCE=>Don't play the saint.
HUME=>I'm not. I probably would have done the same thing if I were in your shoes.
VINCE=>I just hate having to be the one, the proprietor of conservative government sanctioned values.
HUME=>I'm working for an internet company, I'm making some money for a change. Maybe it was meant to be.
VINCE=>The trial is going to be great.
HUME=>I wanted to ask about that.
VINCE=>We've enough test subjects to start collating the results. The final paper -- that's a year off -- could be quite important. I want to submit it to Lancet. I know that sounds like a fantasy...
HUME=>I'm glad.
VINCE=>How is he?
HUME=>Russ? Everyone says he's getting better, but I don't think so. He's in therapy.
VINCE=>Court therapy. The blind leading the mind.
HUME=>I've spent a lot of time with him.
VINCE=>You've spoken with the therapist?
HUME=>Dr. Salberg? She says he's had a "psychotic break."
VINCE=>You believe that?
HUME=>I don't know.
RUSSELL=>...it's hard to put into words.
SALBERG=>It seems to me that at every turn, you seek to avoid the underlying issues.
RUSSELL=>Which underlying issues? Okay, let me put it in terms you can understand. I assumed another form and killed my mother. I fucked my brother's girlfriend, then tried to kill him. Is that Oedipal enough for you? That's just what I mean. Whenever this comes up, you automatically assume this metaphysical weight, strap it on your shoulders like some Herculean backpack with the implication that you're guilty and there's nothing you can do about it. You did not fuck your brother's sister. You did not kill your mother.
SALBERG=>Did you?
RUSSELL=>Somebody killed her.
SALBERG=>But not you.
RUSSELL=>No, I guess not.
SALBERG=>Have you been taking your medication?
RUSSELL=>Yeah.
SALBERG=>It's been three weeks. You should feel something. Can you detect any change?
RUSSELL=>No.
SALBERG=>You still have suicidal feelings? I would like to change your medication. It's an exploratory process.
SALBERG=>Prozac is a relatively mild drug. A friend of mine calls it the penicillin of psychiatry. It's not working and, frankly, I only hoped it would. I want to try something else...
ALLISON=>My God, Hume...
ALLISON=>What is it?
HUME=>I locked it here.
ALLISON=>What?
HUME=>The video tape. The trip tape.
RUSSELL=>Jesus, what happened?
HUME=>We were burglarized.
RUSSELL=>How?
ALLISON=>Some creep broke in. That's how.
RUSSELL=>What'd he take?
HUME=>I don't know. We're still looking.
RUSSELL=>Why would he do that?
HUME=>I don't know what's missing. Nothing valuable. We didn't have anything fucking valuable.
RUSSELL=>It's my fault. Ever since --
HUME=>Would you fucking get off that!
RUSSELL=>What's with this guy? He's got a thing for Special K and Wheat Thins?
RUSSELL=>What was taken?
HUME=>What do you mean?
RUSSELL=>From the cabinet. The locked cabinet.
RUSSELL=>What?
HUME=>That's where I'd put the tape. From the trip.
RUSSELL=>He's found us, he knows we're onto him.
ALLISON=>Who?
RUSSELL=>The murderer!
HUME=>Russ, stop it!
RUSSELL=>You think it's some sort of joke, right? Well, fuck both of you! He knows about all of us, he knows about the police sketch, he knows everything! It's evidence. Lock the doors! We've got to get some guns, protect ourselves. He wants to kill us, because we know who he is!
ALLISON=>We'll sort it out in the morning.
HUME=>I'll call the police.
RUSSELL=>Right, like they're going to do anything.
HUME=>There's been no real damage.
ALLISON=>You're exhausted. You look fried. Now is not the time to jump to decisions.
RUSSELL=>Yeah, I suppose. I don't know what gets into me.
HUME=>Are you all right? We can take you somewhere.
RUSSELL=>No, no, I'm just tired, worn to the bone. Every little thing, I don't know why, sets me off.
HUME=>You need sleep.
RUSSELL=>I know, I know.
HUME=>Where's Mom's van?
RUSSELL=>It ran out of gas. I left it several blocks back. I walked. I'll get it in the morning.
ALLISON=>You're going to be all right?
RUSSELL=>I'm fine. I just need some sleep.
RUSSELL=>You want me to help clean up?
HUME=>We got it under control.
RUSSELL=>Well, I guess I better go track down the car, pick up some gas.
ALLISON=>What a surprise. You're my "crossing guard" now?
HUME=>I love you.
ALLISON=>Oh, that feels good. I love you too.
HUME=>Get in the car.
HUME=>I searched Russ' room. I found the video tape. There can be no other explanation. It was Russ. He broke into the house, he trashed everything.
ALLISON=>He claimed it was the murderer.
HUME=>You know what this means.
ALLISON=>He's no longer in control.
HUME=>He's my brother. I love him.
ALLISON=>He needs help.
HUME=>Fuck help. I know about the help he's getting.
ALLISON=>Is he in danger?
HUME=>What should I do?
ALLISON=>No, that wasn't like a casual question. That was a real question. Is he in danger? Are we in danger from him? Can he hurt us?
HUME=>I don't know.
RUSSELL=>The french fry. My occipital lobe sees it, my temporal lobe says "yum," my parietal lobe says, "I'll eat it," my prefrontal lobe says, "I'll bite it," my motor cortex does so... ...my somesthesic cortex supervises and my brain is thrilled. My brother taught me that.
COED=>But I don't eat fried food.
RUSSELL=>To each her own.
COED=>You're a strange sort of guy to be working at a place like this.
RUSSELL=>Well, I'm working my way up to middle management.
COED=>I'm working my way up to a grilled chicken sandwich and a diet coke.
RUSSELL=>That we can do.
SALBERG=>They initially gave him haloperidol --
HUME=>Haldol?
SALBERG=>Yes.
HUME=>My God.
SALBERG=>It's out of my hands, Dr. Rankin. It's not my case. It's up to the staff at the psychiatric hospital. But I would imagine they would prescribe orally administered Thorazine, at least until they can be sure he's not a danger to himself or others. I'm sorry I wasn't of more help. I knew he was delusional but I didn't think he was hallucinational. He sees things.
HUME=>Of course he sees things. Just because they put him in an institution doesn't mean he's going to stop seeing things.
SALBERG=>He has deeply unresolved issues concerning his father -- and his mother. And you.
HUME=>And Thorazine is going to fix that?
SALBERG=>Thorazine will block the hallucinations, but, in all the literature, it's never proven effective against delusions.
ALLISON=>In other words, he'll still believe in his delusions, he just won't see them?
SALBERG=>Yes. But, as I said, it's no longer my case.
HUME=>Have you ever considered this: Russ, because of his use of psychedelics, has passed through the doors of perception, gained access to another reality and for one reason or another is unable to integrate this reality with his present state?
SALBERG=>That's called schizophrenia. And it's not treatable.
RUSSELL=>You can smoke here, you know. It's ironic. In all of Portland, there's no place you can have a smoke, but here it's all right. I guess they figure we got nothing to lose.
ALLISON=>No, I'm fine Russ.
HUME=>I'm trying to help you, but unfortunately, you've fallen into the great maw of the legal system. We've hired a lawyer, a psychiatric advisor --
RUSSELL=>He came.
HUME=>It's all paperwork and bullshit. If I had a prayer, it would be, "God, let me never fall prey to the US criminal justice system."
ALLISON=>You must not lose faith. We're here for you. You are loved.
RUSSELL=>It's just these side effects, these -- what's the word?
HUME=>Extrapyramidal disorders.
RUSSELL=>Yeah, that and the dry mouth. I want to be normal.
ALLISON=>We know.
RUSSELL=>I'm worried.
HUME=>Why?
RUSSELL=>Him. The murderer. I can't get out of here. He must have figured out by now where I am. I'm not exactly protected in here. He could slip in, you know, wearing a uniform, find me, kill me.
HUME=>I don't know if it's possible, but you need to make an effort. The mind is an extraordinarily powerful organ. You can, Russ, if you apply your mind, wipe all the events surrounding Mom's murder out of your mind. You can make the murderer disappear.
RUSSELL=>I think time is a thing. It's not an abstraction. Time not only changes, but there are different kinds of time --
HUME=>Russ, this is interesting but it is not where we should be concentrating our efforts.
HUME=>I guess that's a hint.
RUSSELL=>If I had a watch, I could tell you. They must have some exciting activity planned.
RUSSELL=>Get me out of here. He's going to find me. He's going to kill me.
RUSSELL=>Ally, when you get outside and into the car, do me a favor.
ALLISON=>What?
RUSSELL=>Smoke a cigarette for me. That's what's nice about being crazy. You smoke out there, I can taste it in here.
VINCE=>Let's take a walk. There's a little park up the way. I find that when something really heavy is weighing on you, it's good to walk.
HUME=>I'm losing my brother. They got him on Thorazine. It's all maintenance crap. His mind is melting.
VINCE=>I know.
HUME=>Huh?
VINCE=>I have contacts at Glenview, people I've consulted with over the years. I've asked about Russ.
HUME=>You know you grow up with a brother, all that sibling shit, you don't think much about it. Of course we were close, not having a father, but I never realized how much I loved him until all this happened.
VINCE=>I've been thinking about it too, in ways that probably go far and beyond what you're thinking. Ways that go back to your father, to the very reason I got involved in this discipline. You know how it is in this dreadful field. You get into psychedelic drugs, you have to be prepared to give everything else up. The medical establishment turns its back on you, any hopes you had of wealth are gone; of the people who take you seriously, half are fucking crazy. You do it because you believe in it. You believe that this sad planet, if there is any hope for it all, its hope lies in some primal reconnection with psychotropic plants. Every religion, you trace it back, you find a bunch of primordial men sitting around a campfire chewing leaves. I went to see your brother.
HUME=>You did?
VINCE=>Yeah. I mean, off the record. I feel responsible.
HUME=>You're not.
HUME=>What do you think?
VINCE=>Are you prepared to hear what I really believe?
HUME=>At this point, I'm prepared for about anything.
VINCE=>Your brother has had what others would call a "psychotic break," and it's not a condition that's going to be improved by conventional medication or therapy. I see no hope in that direction.
HUME=>We're losing him.
VINCE=>This has caused me to go back through the literature, tests, theories. I guess what I'm proposing is psycholytic therapy.
HUME=>"Psychedelic therapy." No one's done that for years. It's been discredited.
VINCE=>It was not discredited. It was criminalized. Extraordinary things were being accomplished, Stanislav Grof, Humphrey Osmond, but then came the anti-establishment movement, the popularization of LSD and the Big Crackdown. Psycholytic therapy just stopped. No one wanted to lose their license.
HUME=>This is what happened to my father?
VINCE=>There is a Shaman down the Amazon from Iquitos, near the Peruvian/Columbian border, Don Macita. He works with the ayahuasca vine. Your father and I tripped with him many years ago. We correspond from time to time. His books of imagery are essentially the same as what Russ describes. He's been doing this all his life. He works in the jungle, using the old ways, which is the best way to experience these primal drugs. It's the only way to ingest heroic doses of psychedelics -- in their natural context. It has the added benefit of being legal.
HUME=>Define "heroic."
VINCE=>If you're talking about ayahuasca, the mother of all harmala alkaloids, I'd say, oral dose, five, six hundred milligrams. I'd have to talk to Don Macita.
HUME=>That's life threatening.
VINCE=>There are different ways to mix the actual brew, which then effects the nature of the journey. I don't think we should wait. Much longer, it may be too late.
HUME=>Wait a second. You're assuming I've already signed onto this "back to the jungle" scheme.
VINCE=>I would need your support.
HUME=>I'm sorry. You don't have it.
HUME=>There was an inmate at a prison for the criminally insane and he told an interviewer, "It's easy to make the cops think you're crazy. All you have to do is act crazy all the time."
HUME=>I wonder if the same is true about sanity. All you have to do is pretend you're sane all the time.
ALLISON=>In that case, you've got me fooled.
HUME=>There is such a thin tissue separating one reality from another, from here and now to somewhere else and some other time. Somewhere this is not happening to us, but we are here and it is now and it is happening. When we had the wake, when we distributed my mother's ashes, my father came over and spoke to me. He said, "Psychedelics ruined my life and they'll ruin yours."
ALLISON=>Father knows best.
ALLISON=>What did Garwood want?
HUME=>What do you mean?
ALLISON=>He called, you went over.
HUME=>It was nothing.
HUME=>I'm Dr. Rankin. We have a two o'clock visitation with Russ Rankin.
RECEPTIONIST=>Just a moment.
ALLISON=>What's happened? It's Russ, isn't it?
ADMINISTRATOR=>Dr. Rankin? I'm Dr. Fielding.
POLICE OFFICER=>We've been trying to reach you.
HUME=>We were running errands.
ADMINISTRATOR=>Don't you have a cell phone?
ALLISON=>We don't like cell phones.
ADMINISTRATOR=>I'm afraid, ah, we can't find your brother.
HUME=>What do you mean, "can't find him?" He's in a lock down ward.
ADMINISTRATOR=>At morning call, the attendant brought him breakfast. The room was empty.
ALLISON=>Could he be hiding in the building somewhere?
POLICE OFFICER=>Security is going through every room, ward, office.
ADMINISTRATOR=>We are interviewing the staff. Someone let him out. There's no other explanation. You haven't heard from him?
HUME=>No.
ADMINISTRATOR=>Any idea where he might be?
HUME=>None.
HUME=>Mrs. Garwood.
MRS. GARWOOD=>Hume.
HUME=>I need to speak to Vince. I tried at the University.
MRS. GARWOOD=>He left.
HUME=>I don't understand.
MRS. GARWOOD=>There was a phone call. Somebody at a conference dropped out and they asked Vince to fill it. He packed, grabbed his passport and headed for the airport.
LENNON=>It took a bit of doing. Your friend didn't go direct. Portland to Mexico City, re-ticket to Bogota, to Quito, to Iquitos.
HUME=>Any other passengers? I mean any passenger on the same flights with Garwood. Can you do that? Used to be, in the day, you had expenses, man hours, gumshoes, now it's just a computer and a teenager with a knack to hack.
NERD=>Here's a reappearing name for the first two flights. "John Russell."
VINCE=>To the people of the Amazon basin, all life is determined by countless spirits and beings who live "on the other side." It is essential for their own survival to be able to enter that world and interact with those spirits to secure well-being for oneself and one's family...
VINCE=>...They get this protection through the ayahuasca ceremony. The preparations, drinking the brew, the visions, the assistance of an ayahuasquero, a shaman. Huasca means vine, aya means souls or dead people, so it's the vine of the dead or the vine of the spirits...
HUME=>...it's in the elite company of the most powerful naturally occurring psychotropic drugs, the harmaline alkaloids: ayahuasca, psilocybin, yage, iboga. DMT is the active ingredient in ayahuasca. Chacruna, a natural MAO inhibitor, makes it orally active, extends the effect. It's essentially a very long DMT trip...
HUME=>...nothing prepares you for it. It's the great unknown. The drug looks inside you and takes you there. The Jungian maps don't apply. Your chakras are of no use. It's a big forest and there are no markers on the trees.
ALLISON=>It's dangerous?
HUME=>No. That's the reason I support naturally occurring psychedelics. If they were dangerous, their use wouldn't have endured this long.
ALLISON=>But is it dangerous for Russell?
VINCE=>Don Macita, the shaman we will meet, he's over seventy now, has a camp in the jungle. He believes the body is full of toxins and these toxins will emerge as demons unless purged. The preparations include four days of cleansing, external and internal, diet and meditation. It involves a sort of mud bath, drinking a diuretic tree sap, oye, eating yucca and rice.
RUSSELL=>But I thought the ayahuasca brew is purgative.
VINCE=>It is. The first couple hours, "la purga," is vomiting and shitting. The visions will start at this time.
RUSSELL=>You're taking this?
VINCE=>We both are.
VINCE=>We will use this period to concentrate on our goals. We will define your areas of conflict, define the person you want to be when the journey ends...
VINCE=>...At first you will feel like you're dying. You'll have to endure this. That's what the drug is about: dying and living...
VINCE=>...You will enter the wholeness of being. You will feel a satisfaction like you've never known...
VINCE=>...First come the patterns, then plants, then animals, then fantastic architecture, the little people, they are guides -- and, at some point, the serpent. Don't be afraid. He is a passage...
VINCE=>...and the end, well, it will be idiosyncratic. It will be what you are...
VINCE=>...The brew is made by mixing crushed ayahuasca vine with alternating layers of chacruna leaves and boiling them...
VINCE=>...the duration, including the purging, will last six to eight hours, although the intensity will slack off after four or five hours.
VINCE=>Hume! Ally!
HUME=>What are you doing here?
VINCE=>Same thing you're doing here. Don Macita, this is Hume Rankin, Russ' brother I told you about.
HUME=>We need to talk.
VINCE=>Sure.
ALLISON=>Show me around.
HUME=>What you've done is illegal. I could report you. You could go to jail.
VINCE=>If that has to be, it has to be. Just wait until we've done what we can for Russ. There's a program.
HUME=>You absolutely baffle me.
VINCE=>I've done a lot of things I regret in my life, and a lot of the things I regret involve your family. When your father was vilified, when the witch hunt hit, he came to me for support and I turned my back on him. I protected my position. He left the country, left his family. I took the easy way when letting them fire you. Now this. I feel my life is defined by the sadness in your family. I believe I can help your brother. He was dying in there. It's so good you're here.
HUME=>Why?
VINCE=>To help Don Macita.
HUME=>You're tripping as well?
VINCE=>I wasn't sure before, but now I am. I want to apologize to your father. His spirit is all around here. Come, you've got to talk to Don Macita. We'll go over the counseling --
HUME=>Don't you think I ought to talk to Russ first?
HUME=>I brought along your meds, just in case.
RUSSELL=>You're kidding. That stuff is poison. It's poison for the brain.
HUME=>I know, I know, I just felt it would be irresponsible not to. I didn't know what condition you would be in.
RUSSELL=>That last night in the sanitarium, I was holding on, just barely, concentrating every atom in my body to remain sane, like those kids in "Nightmare on Elm Street" trying not to sleep. Then I heard the door open -- he had come for me, the murderer, but it was Professor Garwood.
HUME=>How are you now?
RUSSELL=>All this cleansing and my conversations with Don Macita have cleared my mind. Everything is now directed toward the journey. I am prepared. I want to do this.
HUME=>You're not going in anger?
RUSSELL=>No.
HUME=>Remember this journey you're taking, this drug, what it's doing it's doing for your benefit. Pay attention. It wants to help you. You know how I like to say they're not recreational drugs? That's not true. They are recreational. Re- creational. You must re-create your life. Remake it, heal it. If you get lost, if you get frightened, if you're in danger, repeat the mantra. If you hear me saying, "Om mani pene hung," you'll know that I'm with you, you're not alone.
HUME=>Russ, take this. I bought this in Iquitos. It didn't cost anything. It's supposed to bring good luck.
RUSSELL=>If only it were that easy.
RUSSELL=>Hume, Hume... om mani...
HUME AND RUSSELL=>...pene hung, om mani pene hung...
VINCE=>They are guides.
RUSSELL=>Om mani pene hung...
HUME=>Where are you?
HUME=>Om mani pene hung...
VOICE=>They were all built for love.
EVANGELINE=>Russell.
HUME=>How do you feel?
VINCE=>How was it?
RUSSELL=>Idiosyncratic.
VINCE=>That's the amazing thing. Every experience is absolutely unique.
RUSSELL=>Let's go over to Mom's house. I want to apologize for that stunt I pulled the other day.
HUME=>You're still groggy. And you've got to do the questionaire.
RUSSELL=>Yeah, but after.
HUME=>Sure. Okay.
EVANGELINE=>It's so amazing you came over. I was just getting ready to call you.
HUME=>What happened?
EVANGELINE=>It's hard to explain. Dr. Klein called. He had gotten the latest x-rays. I didn't understand. I called him back to be sure. He repeated it. The tumor is diminishing. It's responding to treatment. It's almost gone.
HUME AND RUSSELL=>Oh, Mom.
HUME=>It's miraculous.
RUSSELL=>I'm so happy.
EVANGELINE=>I love you boys.
RUSSELL=>Me too.
HUME=>I can't wait to tell Ally.
RUSSELL=>How can you stand to have that thing on all the time?
EVANGELINE=>It's just background noise. It's comforting.
EVANGELINE=>Come, boys, sit with me a while. Just hold my hands.
EVANGELINE=>Let's enjoy what we have while we have it. Reality is so fragile.
