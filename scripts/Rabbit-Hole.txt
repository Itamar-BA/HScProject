PEG=>I am so sorry.
BECCA=>No, it’s fine.
HOWIE=>Did we enjoy it? BECCA
BECCA=>What time is it?
HOWIE=>What’s going on?
A BLANK WHITE PAGE=>A hand reaches into frame and draws a straight line in black ink. The hand draws a parallel black line and then connects the two with an oddly shaped circular end. We pull back to reveal the hand is drawing a network of intersecting tubes and portal openings. The artist shades in a section.
BECCA=>That's terrific.
HOWIE=>Wow. Tee-ball.
GABBY=>How’s it going?
HOWIE=>Becca, be nice.
BECCA=>I’d like to go.
IZZY=>Ex-girlfriend. NAT
A BLANK BLACK PAGE=>The hand reaches into frame and starts to place cutouts of the earlier seen portal openings on top of each other. The hand cuts out several more portal openings and adds them to the intersecting group. We pull back to reveal a large network of intersecting tunnels.
GARY=>Yeah, you too.
NAT=>What's wrong?
HOWIE=>You’re hardly in this car, what’s the difference?
BECCA=>It’s just weird.
BECCA=>Let’s do gifts.
IZZY=>Yes! Pass ‘em!
NAT=>Okay, now me.
BECCA=>What’s his name? HOWIE
JASON=>Are you waiting for me?
BECCA=>That'll be nice.
HOWIE=>For christsake! BECCA
BECCA=>You don't know?
HOWIE=>I love my wife.
BECCA=>Only people without children give gifts like this.
BECCA=>What'd she say?
DONNA=>What’s in here?
HOWIE=>Oh, that’s, uh--
LORI=>Not happening. SAMMY
LORI=>Are you a mom?
LORI=>I don’t care.
JASON=>No, she didn't.
BECCA=>What time is it?
JASON=>Reading into it?
HOWIE=>Then we wrap it.
