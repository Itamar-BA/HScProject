MAX=>The escape was not my idea. I mean, escape to what? We didn't know there was anything else.
MAX=>It was Zack who said we had to leave. So I guessed he saved my life... And I never even got the chance to thank him.
LYDECKER=>This is Lydecker. I want you to capture if you can. But if any of them make it to the perimeter, you are to terminate. Is that understood?
VOICE=>Confirming, Sir, you're giving an order ten-oh-six.
LYDECKER=>I'll take responsibility. If they reach the outer fence...shoot to kill.
MAX=>Go on... GO!
JONDY=>No. We stick together.
MAX=>Go, Jondy. I'll find you.
JONDY=>Max...
LIEUTENANT=>We've got seven so far...three wounded, two killed. And my men are taking a helluva beating.
LYDECKER=>Just get them, Lieutenant. It's your ass if one of them makes it to the outside.
LIEUTENANT=>Realistically, Sir, it's ten degrees out here. How far can these kids get?
LYDECKER=>Find them.
MAX=>Sometimes it seems like it happened to someone else. Like maybe it was a story I heard... The hardest part is not knowing...if any of them made it. If I knew for sure I was the only one left, it would be worse. At least now I can make up lives for them... Like maybe Jondy's a fashion photographer...or an architect. The truth is they'd just be like me... living on the run, always looking over your shoulder.
MAX=>Hope is for losers. It's a con job people trip behind until they finally get a grip on the cold hard truth... But still I...hope they're out there, somewhere...some of them. And that they're okay.
GIRL'S VOICE=>It sucks.
MAX=>What sucks?
KENDRA=>I come home, it's three a.m., you're still out. I feel like I got hit by a cement truck and you been up for an hour bouncing around. That by definition sucks.
MAX=>I made you coffee. That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
KENDRA=>Thanks, it's starting to kick in. I feel almost human.
MAX=>Yeah, me too.
MAX=>Almost.
MAX=>Knock, knock.
MAX=>Hi guys. Let's roll, hotshot.
THEO=>Gotta take a personal day. Whatever it is I got, I'm bitin' it bad.
MAX=>It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
THEO=>You're the best, Maxie.
JACINDA=>Come on, little bit, you're gonna be late for school. Three more bites.
OMAR=>Two more.
JACINDA=>But big ones. Everything's a negotiation.
MAX=>Jam Pony Messenger.
YOUNG SOLDIER=>Have a good one.
MAX=>They used to say one nuclear bomb can ruin your whole day. It was sort of a joke until the June morning those terrorist bozos whacked us with an electromagnetic pulse from eighty miles up... You always hear people yappin' on how it was all different before the pulse...land of milk and honey, blah blah blah, with plenty of food and jobs and things actually worked. I was too young to remember so...whatever.
MAX=>Thing I don't get is why they call it a depression. I mean, everyone's broke but they aren't really all that depressed... Life goes on.
HERBAL=>Nobody there to sign for it, mon. What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
NORMAL=>So you just decided to return it to the sender. Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
HERBAL=>Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
NORMAL=>Which is none of your business...or mine.
HERBAL=>It concerns only Jah. But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
NORMAL=>Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
NORMAL=>This is a hot run. Beat it. You're late.
MAX=>I was on call.
NORMAL=>I want you on call here.
MAX=>What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
NORMAL=>More like deployed in bed asleep.
MAX=>I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
NORMAL=>And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
MAX=>He's sick.
NORMAL=>For a change.
MAX=>How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this. The guy is seriously not well.
NORMAL=>You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
MAX=>I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
MAX=>Morning, Sunshine...
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike. Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes. So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
MAX=>At least he didn't swing with your ride.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that? Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
MAX=>Straight.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
SKETCHY=>Homemade. Natalie baked them for our anniversary. The big one-oh.
MAX=>The big one-oh?
NATALIE=>We went on our first date ten months ago tonight.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Congratulations.
EYES ONLY=>Do not attempt to adjust your set. This is a Video Free America bulletin. The cable hack will last exactly sixty seconds. It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped, and it is the only free voice left in this city...
SKETCHY EYES ONLY)=>Is this guy for real? There are certain men who move through the world with MAX impunity. Their actions, no matter how vile, are immune Who knows... from consequence. Edgar Sonrisa is such a man. You've seen him smiling at political DRUID fund-raisers, sitting at the He ever been wrong Mayor's table drinking about anything? champagne. He owns shopping centers, a trucking company and the largest medical MAX supply company in San You ask me, he's on the Francisco. He also runs drugs hustle same as everyone and guns up and down the west else. coast. He's very publicly, very obviously dirty. But he has never been arrested... Someone shushes her. never indicted. Journalists who have attempted to expose him have been gunned down in DRUID the street. Their blood is Doesn't mean he's not the ink of our modern news. telling the truth. Those who've opposed him have vanished... All of that is about to change...
MAX=>Doesn't mean he is.
HERBAL=>Just hope Jah's looking out for his ass 'cause he's messing with the brimstone, bruddah.
SKETCHY=>Major negativity heading this-a-way.
SKETCHY=>Someone oughta drop a little science on these straight edge idiots.
MAX=>Not my problem...or yours.
MAX=>Catch you back at the wall.
SKETCHY=>Later.
MAX=>Hit you back later.
BEN=>Never seen her miss.
MAX=>Delivery...1906.
GUARD=>No bikes in the elevator.
MAX=>This was s'posed to be the financial district, back before the banks closed. America really thought they had it dialed in-- money hangin' out the ass. But it was all just a bunch of ones and zeros in a computer someplace. So when that bomb went KA-BLOOEY and the electromagnetic pulse turned all the ones and zeros into plain ol' zeros, everyone's like "no way." Now America's just another broke ex-super power looking for a handout and wondering why.
MAX=>Later.
MAX=>'s up.
SKETCHY=>Fog City's finest.
MAX=>Quitting time. Grab a cold one?
SKETCHY=>I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
MAX=>Right, the big one-oh.
SKETCHY=>But I'll take a rain check...
SKETCHY=>Can I talk to Natalie? You're not going to believe this. I'm walkin' out the door and my idiot boss sticks me with a delivery way the hell out in the East Bay somewhere. So I'm not gonna be able to make dinner... I know it's not fair... I begged, I pleaded, I pissed, I moaned, but I gotta do what I gotta do... We'll do something special, I promise... I love you too. Mousetrap. Kisses.
SKETCHY=>Sorry I'm late but--
ORIGINAL CINDY=>You in?
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Who else?
LAMAR=>What's the action?
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Max can repeat a fourteen-digit phone number by listening to the beep tones.
LAMAR=>Yeah...
ORIGINAL CINDY=>On speed dial. Buy-in's ten.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Last chance... Okay. Let's do it.
MAX=>Seven-Nine-Six-Five-Seven-Three-Eight-One- Four-Two-Four-Six-Nine-Five.
DRUID=>How'd you do that?
MAN'S VOICE=>I'll have a beer...since you're buying.
MAX=>I wasn't.
DARREN=>How're ya doin', Max.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>You mean until you showed up?
DARREN=>You're not still pissed?
MAX=>Why would I be pissed?
DARREN=>It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that?
DARREN=>Justine was not an unwilling participant.
DARREN=>Do you know why I went after Justine?
ORIGINAL CINDY=>She was there...
DARREN=>Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank. You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
DARREN=>Could you give us a moment.
DARREN=>I was crazy about you...am crazy about you. But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
MAX=>I'm really glad we're having this conversation. You're right. I was angry at you. But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault. Can you ever forgive me?
DARREN=>I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
MAX=>What guys do. 'Nother order.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
MAX=>I just don't go in with any expectations.
NATALIE=>You guys seen Sketchy?
MAX=>Thought he was having dinner with you.
NATALIE=>He had to bail at the last minute on accounta some emergency run. Thought maybe he stopped by here on the way home.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Haven't seen him. But if we do--
NATALIE=>Hope he's okay.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>He probably just got stuck in traffic or something.
MAX=>That's odd...
ORIGINAL CINDY=>What?
MAX=>Tell me the truth. Am I a female fog bank?
ORIGINAL CINDY=>You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
MAX=>No.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
MAX=>Yeah.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Hell yeah. There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying. You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
MAX=>A little what?
ORIGINAL CINDY=>You know what I'm saying.
MAX=>If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>How long you and me known each other?
MAX=>A long time.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
MAX=>Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>And back at ya. Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
MAX=>A fog bank.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
MAX=>Gotta go.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Where?
MAX=>It's a secret.
VOGELSANG=>I asked you to keep that thing outside.
MAX=>You did.
VOGELSANG=>You drive away business roarin' in like that.
MAX=>Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
VOGELSANG=>You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
MAX=>My name's not kid. It's client. As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle. Now, you got something for me or not?
VOGELSANG=>Right here someplace.
VOGELSANG=>I got a hit on the car. An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
MAX=>Sorry, I was seven at the time.
MAX=>Who's this guy? This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
VOGELSANG=>He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing. It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped. So we don't get anything on the seller. Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
MAX=>Thank you.
VOGELSANG=>He says he got it from a woman. Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
HANNAH=>Get in! Hurry, come on!
VOGELSANG=>Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
MAX=>Then what?
VOGELSANG=>Then what? That's it. That's all I got.
MAX=>Nothing on Hannah?
VOGELSANG=>A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
MAX=>She was a nurse. She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the... ...the clinic. There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
VOGELSANG=>Only a last name would be nice. Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
MAX=>What about the other kids? You get anything on them?
VOGELSANG=>They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
MAX=>You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
VOGELSANG=>Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners. This kind of search...it's heavy spadework. I'm gonna need--
MAX=>More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
LOGAN=>Eyes Only cannot be bought or threatened. And through the Eyes Only informant net, a truth-speaker has come forward.
LOGAN=>The testimony of one fearless witness will soon lead to an indictment of Edgar Sonrisa for multiple counts of murder.
LOGAN=>The drug cortodiazapine is expensive, in short supply and much sought after as a cancer treatment. It is shipped to veterans' clinics to treat the Balkan War Syndrome, a disease which is otherwise fatal.
LOGAN=>Sonrisa has been replacing the federal drug shipments with sugar pills, selling the real cortodiazapine on the Canadian black market for two thousand dollars a bottle. What fuels the demand? The belief that cortodiazapine could slow the effects of aging when taken in large doses.
LOGAN=>There is no hard scientific evidence to support these claims. But that doesn't stop Edgar Sonrisa from peddling this drug to the few wealthy, privileged foreigners who can afford to pay any price for vanity's sake.
LOGAN=>Edgar Sonrisa gets richer while combat vets exposed to the genetically- engineered bio-war agents go untreated. All over this city, they are repaid for defending this country by being allowed to waste away and die...a slow, agonizing death...
LAUREN=>Oh my God! In here! IN HERE!
MAX=>SHHH! Don't do that!
MAX=>Sorry.
LOGAN=>Put it down.
LOGAN=>Lauren...are you okay?
LAUREN=>We're alright.
LOGAN=>Peter...
MAX=>If he's the side of beef with the walkie- talkie, he's okay but he'll be awhile.
LOGAN=>You're a thief?
MAX=>Girl's gotta make a living.
LOGAN=>Thank God.
MAX=>First time I ever heard that.
LOGAN=>I was expecting someone else.
MAX=>Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
LOGAN=>You're lucky. I almost pulled the trigger.
MAX=>I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
LOGAN=>We're just a little tense right now... It's okay.
LOGAN=>You have good taste. French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
MAX=>Whoever that is.
LOGAN=>So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
MAX=>No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
LOGAN=>Who is...
MAX=>The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
LOGAN=>Stay back, Peter.
MAX=>Look, I'd love to hang and discuss art but I gotta get going.
PETER=>Aaaah! Aaaah! Easy, my wrist is gonna snap!
MAX=>That could happen. By the way, I love your show.
LOGAN=>Nooo! Waaaiiit!
MAX=>Kendra...this is a motorcycle. It's sole reason for being is to go fast. Very fast. It was not put on this earth for you to use as a clothesline. I love you as a roommate and a friend, but, make no mistake, I love my motorcycle more. DON'T-TOUCH-THE-BIKE, OKAY?
WARREN=>What time is it?
DARREN=>What are you doing here?
MAX=>I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
DARREN=>You're roommates?
KENDRA=>Some of us are trying to sleep.
DARREN=>You didn't tell me you lived with her.
KENDRA=>You know each other?
MAX=>He's a mistake I made about six months before you did. But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
KENDRA=>Yech...
DARREN=>Nothing happened between me and Tia.
KENDRA=>Leave. Now.
DARREN=>Can I say something in my defense?
KENDRA=>No.
MAX=>Everybody down.
DARREN=>What is it?
MAX=>Police drone.
MAX=>It's a sweep. C'mon.
DARREN=>What? Where're we going?
DARREN=>Lemme put some clothes on.
MAX=>No time.
KENDRA=>Move it.
DARREN=>Where?
MAX=>Out there.
DARREN=>No way.
MAX=>Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
DARREN=>But I'm afraid of--
MAX=>Don't look down.
KENDRA=>What a creep.
MAX=>And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
COP=>All unauthorized individuals vacate the premises or face immediate arrest.
CLARKE=>Ladies...
MAX=>Morning, Walter. What's the good word?
CLARKE=>Just doing my part to keep the homeless problem from getting out of hand.
MAX=>Coffee?
CLARKE=>Read my mind... You haven't seen anyone trespassing around here?
MAX=>Gosh, no.
CLARKE=>Seventh floor is vacant and secure. Have a nice day.
KENDRA=>What's with you? Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
MAX=>Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
KENDRA=>You didn't...
MAX=>Every week.
DARREN=>Max? Kendra?
DARREN=>C'mon guys...
MAX=>It's cool.
MAX=>Before I forget, Theo's check. I got in late last night and didn't want to bother you.
JACINDA=>Thanks.
MAX=>How's he feeling?
JACINDA=>Took him to the hospital again. They gave him some medicine but he says it's not helping.
MAX=>You know how it is. You or me get sick, life goes on. A guy get the sniffles and the world's coming to an end.
THEO=>That you, Max?
MAX=>Playing hooky again?
THEO=>Feel like the dog's dinner.
MAX=>Probably a touch of what's going around.
THEO=>I know what I got, Max. They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets. Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
MAX=>Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
THEO=>What if he's on the level?
MAX=>Here's the dealio on Eyes Only. He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid. So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
THEO=>Tell everybody hey.
MAX=>You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
MAX=>Like I said, guys are the weaker sex.
PETER=>Glad you're getting your money's worth outta that tape. Had to grease the guard a hundred for it.
PETER=>You tryin' to I.D. the perp, or a new girlfriend?
LOGAN=>If I'd just gotten my ass kicked by a size five, I might be inclined to mind my own business.
MAX=>Like that?
MESSENGER=>Not bad for a beginner.
MAX=>Hey, Sketchy--
SKETCHY=>We gotta talk.
MAX=>What's up?
SKETCHY=>It's kinda important.
MAX=>You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh. I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
SKETCHY=>Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
SKETCHY=>See, I've more or less been seeing this other person.
MAX=>I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
SKETCHY=>I know what you're thinking. But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with. As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much. So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
MAX=>Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
SKETCHY=>Max--
MAX=>Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
SKETCHY=>Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
MAX=>You left out condescending.
SKETCHY=>But there's another side--
MAX=>Here it comes. The part where the guy turns everything around.
SKETCHY=>I'm the victim here.
MAX=>Really?
SKETCHY=>Hear me out. This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
MAX=>And you were a sympathetic ear.
SKETCHY=>Exactly.
MAX=>Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
SKETCHY=>She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie. Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
MAX=>Does this person have a name?
SKETCHY=>Lydia.
MAX=>And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
SKETCHY=>I'm a toy to her.
MAX=>A toy?
SKETCHY=>She's as much as said so. But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
MAX=>Fight fire with fire. Threaten to go to her husband.
SKETCHY=>Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed. Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
MAX=>What happens if you level with her?
SKETCHY=>Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
MAX=>And why should she?
SKETCHY=>Look Max, I made a terrible mistake. One I'll never, ever make again. Natalie and I are soulmates. I know that now. She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
MAX=>What is it you want me to do?
NORMAL=>Pick-up at four-eleven Montgomery going to Pacific Heights.
LOGAN=>I'm looking for a lady who works here.
NORMAL=>Ladies would be elsewhere.
LOGAN=>Know where I can find her?
NORMAL=>You don't want to.
LOGAN=>But she does work here?
NORMAL=>She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me. Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
LOGAN=>I need to talk to her.
NORMAL=>Can't help you.
LOGAN=>How 'bout her name and address?
NORMAL=>Max something. I got no clue where she stays.
LOGAN=>Any idea when she'll be back?
NORMAL=>None.
LOGAN=>I'll wait.
NORMAL=>She hangs out after work at a place called Zeitgeist.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
MAX=>Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Unlikely.
MAX=>And because he's my friend.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Friends don't help other friends cheat.
MAX=>And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Please...
MAX=>They're prisoners to their genes.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>So are dogs.
MAX=>They don't have a lot of moving parts.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Only one I can think of.
MAX=>Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
MAX=>But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
MAX=>So this guy walks into a bar and says...
LOGAN=>We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
MAX=>Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
LOGAN=>Logan Cale.
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Hey.
MAX=>Sorry about your window.
LOGAN=>Can we go somewhere and talk?
ORIGINAL CINDY=>Woop, Xena's on.
MAX=>Lemme get my coat.
LOGAN=>The one you're wearing?
MAX=>Right.
MAX=>How'd you find me?
LOGAN=>Wasn't that hard.
MAX=>Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
LOGAN=>Now you know who I am, where I live. I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
MAX=>So now you tracked me down. What d'ya think?
LOGAN=>Too early to tell.
MAX=>How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
LOGAN=>Lauren's not my wife.
MAX=>Girlfriend?
LOGAN=>One of my sources. Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
MAX=>What's your shot in all this? Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
LOGAN=>Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
MAX=>So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
LOGAN=>Look around at all this... Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life. Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared. They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands. Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
MAX=>You miss the good ol' days. Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat. Those good ol' days?
LOGAN=>People had a choice, even if they took it for granted. And now they don't.
MAX=>So what are you gonna do about it?
LOGAN=>Something.
MAX=>Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
LOGAN=>You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
MAX=>Is the social studies class over for today?
LOGAN=>Yeah...
LOGAN=>That was a pretty extraordinary display of athleticism the other night. In fact, a little too extraordinary. You wanna tell me how--
SKETCHY=>So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
MAX=>You set up on Lydia. When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up. I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
SKETCHY=>She tells you how I've been--
MAX=>--a philandering pig.
SKETCHY=>But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
MAX=>Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
SKETCHY=>I just don't want Natalie to ever find out. She deserves better.
MAX=>How'd you get her out of town?
SKETCHY=>Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
MAX=>And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
SKETCHY=>She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
MAX=>I'll give it my best shot.
SKETCHY=>Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
MAX=>You don't.
NORMAL=>Fourteen-thirteen Market. Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
MAX=>Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
NORMAL=>What about this?
MAX=>I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
MAX=>Who is it?
LYDIA=>A friend of your fiance's.
MAX=>What do you want?
LYDIA=>To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
MAX=>Who are you?
LYDIA=>My name's Lydia. And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
MAX=>You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
LYDIA=>With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
MAX=>How do I know you're telling the truth?
LYDIA=>He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately? That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back. Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting. He didn't either...at first.
MAX=>Look, I don't know what you want--
LYDIA=>I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
MAX=>And so should you. Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you. I know all about how you threatened him. That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
LYDIA=>Oh?
MAX=>Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
LYDIA=>How sweet. Standing by your man, even after what he did. You're a very understanding person.
MAX=>Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
LYDIA=>You're also a fool.
MAX=>I think you should go now.
LYDIA=>Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch. I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend. Not him, and certainly not you. Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
MAX=>This is not a place you wanna go.
LYDIA=>Let go of my hand.
MAX=>I'm working very hard to respect my elders here but don't push your luck.
LYDIA=>Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
MAX=>Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
LYDIA=>Okay, okay.
MAX=>Say the words, "I understand."
LYDIA=>I understand.
MAX=>And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
SKETCHY=>You rock, Max. You... Rock...
MAX=>Easy Sketchy.
SKETCHY=>No, I'm serious. That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
MAX=>Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
SKETCHY=>She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
MAX=>You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
SKETCHY=>She was the one--
MAX=>None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
SKETCHY=>True, but--
MAX=>You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish. And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up. Understand?
SKETCHY=>Okay, okay, okay--
MAX=>Say the words, "I understand."
SKETCHY=>I understand.
VOGELSANG=>Yeah... Who's this? ...Oh, hey Phyllis, didn't recognize your voice... What's up? ...The usual, doing some work for a client. Thinks one of his bartender's got his hand in the till. Kid works three days a week for tips, just dropped forty large on a new ride... Tonight? ...I really can't... Of course I want to see you but--
VOGELSANG=>What are you wearing? ...The red one? ...See you in a few.
VOGELSANG=>We're closed. Sorry.
VOGELSANG=>Damnit...
MAX=>Kendra... Anybody home?
LOGAN=>Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
MAX=>I won't be staying.
LOGAN=>I'm not a half bad cook.
MAX=>Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
LOGAN=>It was open.
MAX=>You got a lotta nerve.
LOGAN=>Me? You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
MAX=>Completely different situation. I steal things in order to sell them. For money. It's called commerce. But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
LOGAN=>Bent?
MAX=>Bent.
LOGAN=>You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
MAX=>How do I know you didn't?
LOGAN=>So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
MAX=>Am I s'posed to be grateful?
LOGAN=>That would be appropriate, yes.
MAX=>How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
LOGAN=>You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
MAX=>Whoa there, Tex! We've been through all this.
LOGAN=>It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
MAX=>We are not fine.
PETER=>This is a tactical exposure which I go on record as not liking.
LOGAN=>Noted... Peter, do me a favor and look in on Lauren and Sophy.
LOGAN=>Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
MAX=>Yes on all counts.
LOGAN=>I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention. But I had to see you.
MAX=>You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
LOGAN=>I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
MAX=>You need to get out more.
LOGAN=>C'mere, I want to show you something.
MAX=>Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
LOGAN=>No, I meant this.
LOGAN=>Probably the most singularly beautiful face I've ever seen.
MAX=>Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
LOGAN=>Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
MAX=>What are you doing?
LOGAN=>And now I think I know pretty much everything.
LOGAN=>Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
MAX=>The other ones?
LOGAN=>The other one like you...
MAX=>You lost me.
LOGAN=>C'mon, Max. First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
LOGAN=>L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures. Then the lightbulb went off.
MAX=>You did go through my stuff.
LOGAN=>I got an anonymous report a couple years ago from a guy who says he was a lab tech at a covert genetics lab in the Wyoming mountains...
MAX=>I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
LOGAN=>He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
MAX=>Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
LOGAN=>The bar code on your neck, Max. I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
LOGAN=>There were a couple of dozen of these transgenic kids. And in oh-nine, a few months before the pulse, six of them escaped.
MAX=>Six?
LOGAN=>You're one of those kids, Max.
LAUREN=>Goodnight Bears. Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks. And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house. And goodnight--
SOPHY=>I don't want to move away.
LAUREN=>I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
SOPHY=>But why can't we stay here?
LAUREN=>Because we can't. There's nothing here for us anymore.
SOPHY=>Are we in some kind of trouble?
LAUREN=>No...
SOPHY=>Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
LAUREN=>What makes you cry?
SOPHY=>If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
LAUREN=>Pretty much the same reasons I was crying. But things will be better when we move to a new place.
SOPHY=>Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
SOPHY=>I'm going to read you a story... And goodnight mouse. Goodnight camel. And goodnight brush. Goodnight nobody. And goodnight mush--
MAX=>We got separated right away. I never knew how many made it.
LOGAN=>How well do you remember the lab?
MAX=>I remember fine. I just didn't understand what was going on. They never told us anything except what to do. It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
LOGAN=>How much do you know?
MAX=>I know they made me. Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
LOGAN=>The technical term for you is "chimera"...
MAX=>Yeah...a made-up creature. Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
LOGAN=>A girl.
MAX=>Your basic hodge-podge.
LOGAN=>Hardly...
MAX=>Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
LOGAN=>Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
MAX=>You said you could help.
LOGAN=>I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
MAX=>What's in it for you?
LOGAN=>Your help.
MAX=>I already don't like the sound of this.
LOGAN=>The woman you met, Lauren. She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar. The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
MAX=>That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
LOGAN=>She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers. You know who Sonrisa is?
MAX=>Yeah, I catch your hacks. He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
LOGAN=>So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow. They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
MAX=>I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
LOGAN=>She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
MAX=>They want me...bad. Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever. Best case, I wind up back in that facility. More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
MAX=>They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
LOGAN=>You're a soldier, Max. That's what you were put here for. But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
MAX=>That's deep. But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
INGA=>Where'd you clip this?
MAX=>I didn't. It was a present from a guy.
INGA=>Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
MAX=>Thought so. Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
INGA=>Same old story. Not interested.
MAX=>Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
INGA=>What're you looking for?
MAX=>A grand.
INGA=>Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
MAX=>I ain't mad at you...
INGA=>I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
MAX=>Later.
INGA=>I shouldn't do this. But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power. Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
MAX=>I don't get involved with guns.
INGA=>I'll make it worth your while.
MAX=>It's a rule.
MAX=>You're light a deuce.
INGA=>Am I?
INGA=>So Max, what do you do with all your money?
MAX=>I got overhead...
MAX=>What happened?
VOGELSANG=>Walked in on some hump ransacking the place. Disgruntled former client, or someone I'm looking into trying to see what I got. Or it coulda been your garden variety junkie boost. Who knows?
MAX=>As long as you're okay.
VOGELSANG=>I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance. Lemme get the file.
VOGELSANG=>If you need to freshen up, bathroom's over there.
MAX=>Please.
VOGELSANG=>I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
MAX=>Here's your money.
VOGELSANG=>Whoever tossed this place wants you. And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
MAX=>How's this about me?
VOGELSANG=>They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery. But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
MAX=>Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
VOGELSANG=>Hardware's too sophisticated. It's gotta be the government. And why do I think they're looking for you?
MAX=>You're crazy.
VOGELSANG=>I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
VOGELSANG=>Your fiance has four previous wives. His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off. Which is what you oughta do.
MAX=>Bastard...
VOGELSANG=>I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
MAX=>You and me both.
OMAR=>Blam-Blam-Blam, you're dead.
MAX=>Turn that off, Omar, before you get the cops on us.
JACINDA=>Come on, Omar, it's time to go to sleep.
MAX=>Are you okay?
MAX=>What's wrong?
JACINDA=>I took Theo to the hospital tonight... He couldn't walk so I borrowed some money and we took a cab but...
JACINDA=>...he didn't make it... He's dead. Oh my God... Oh my God...
SKETCHY=>F.Y.I... Normal's a grumpy muffin this morning.
NORMAL=>Nice of you to join us.
NORMAL=>Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
MAX=>Theo's dead.
NEWS ANCHOR=>Two men are dead, and another critically wounded after a shoot-out near the Superior Court Building today. A police air-remote unit captured this dramatic footage at 9:47 this morning, after automatically homing on the sound of gunfire.
SKETCHY=>That was extreme! Did you see that one guy--
MAX=>Shut-up...
SANDOVAL=>We been set up on Vogelsang thirty-six hours and so far, nothing.
DOCHNOVICH=>A few customer complaints-- the dryer ate my money, rinse cycle's not long enough, that kind of thing.
SANDOVAL=>And three or four P.I. clients. Strictly run of the mill. I don't think this guy can help us.
LYDECKER=>Twenty-three computer hits from one detective. He browses Wyoming DMV records from ten years ago, employment files on health care personnel working in the Gillette area around the same time. Then he searches prison records for unidentified males and females approximately eighteen to twenty years old. And you want me to believe it's happenstance?
DOCHNOVICH=>Since the pulse there've been how many thousand missing person searches. This is probably one of them.
SANDOVAL=>And nothing in those searches or our surveillance connects him with Manticore.
LYDECKER=>No. He's trying to track down these kids... And we're not going to do anything to get in his way.
MAX=>Sure looks like you pissed off the wrong folks.
MAX=>Nurses beat me to it.
MAX=>Coulda told ya. You take a header into the deep end when the pool's empty, you're gonna go splat. Law of gravity. And even Jesus Christ himself had to obey the law of gravity. For awhile anyway. Well, better you than me.
MAX=>The one I feel sorry for is that poor woman with the kid. She shoulda told ya to stick it like I did. But she bought your crap about "doin' what's right"... dumb bitch.
MAX=>And just so you know, I don't feel the slightest guilt about not watchin' her back. That's on you, hotshot. One hundred percent.
MAX=>I probably oughta let 'em just finish the job. Least then you won't get more innocent people whacked on accounta your ambition... On the other hand--
MAX=>You did lay that statue on me.
MAX=>Which I was able to fence for a coupla bucks--
MAX=>Been wantin' to buy myself a new motorcycle.
MAX=>Thinking about stepping up to a Harley... You take care.
MAX=>Makes me wanna take a shower.
MAX=>Bingo...
MAX=>Damn... Are you alright?
LAUREN=>They took my daughter.
MAX=>I know.
LAUREN=>I couldn't get to her. It all happened so fast. Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run. And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want. If I run, maybe they'll come after me. Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
MAX=>They won't hurt her.
MAX=>Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
LAUREN=>Can you help me get her back?
MAX=>Look, I'd really like to...
MAX=>...So I will.
MAX=>The shooter who tried to finish off Logan... Works for Sonrisa, surprise, surprise. Bruno Anselmo. Born 1990, served in Iraq, dishonorable discharge, armed robbery, assault, assault with a deadly weapon, arson, attempted rape-- your basic renaissance dirt bag.
LAUREN=>If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
MAX=>We're not going that route. Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
LAUREN=>What else can we do?
MAX=>Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
DRIVER=>Mayor Steckler to see Mister Sonrisa.
STEROID CASE=>I'll need to search the trunk.
BLONDE=>It's not what it looks like. I'm diabetic.
BLONDE=>Who are you?
MAX=>Bruno's girlfriend.
BLONDE=>Oh, yeah?
MAX=>Yeah.
BLONDE=>But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
MAX=>No?
BLONDE=>No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
MAX=>Okay, okay. I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
BLONDE=>How I make my living, what's your point?
MAX=>This.
REDHEAD=>Girl, you work that dress.
VOICE=>Don't rush off.
BRUNO=>Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras. He wants you to come see him.
MAX=>I'm on a break.
BRUNO=>Guess again.
SONRISA=>The only thing better than four queens is... ...five. Over here next to me...for luck.
MAX=>Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
SONRISA=>I'll bet you can. Sit.
MAX=>Not right now.
SONRISA=>Not right now? Okay, when?
MAX=>Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
SONRISA=>Quite a mouth on a girl so young... ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
MAX=>Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
SONRISA=>I actually know how this works.
MAX=>You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
MAX=>And I'm gonna give you Lauren Braganza.
SONRISA=>Give us a minute. OUT!
SONRISA=>Check her.
SONRISA=>Who are you?
MAX=>What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
SONRISA=>Why I always use condoms.
BRUNO=>No wire.
MAX=>Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works. You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
BRUNO=>Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
MAX=>Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
MAX=>The plan is I call her cell number to okay a meet at a certain location.
MAX=>Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
SONRISA=>Pull the cash.
BRUNO=>I don't like this--
SONRISA=>Get it.
SONRISA=>So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
MAX=>I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this. You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country. I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
SONRISA=>And she bought that?
MAX=>I have sincere eyes.
SONRISA=>Make the call.
MAX=>She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
SONRISA=>She's got my word.
MAX=>She's gonna want to hear for herself.
MAX=>Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think. If she hears her kid's voice...
LAUREN=>Hello...
MAX=>Hang on, Lauren. We're conferencing in Sophy.
MAN'S VOICE=>Yeah?
SONRISA=>Put the kid on.
SOPHY=>Hello...
LAUREN=>Sophy? Are you okay?
SOPHY=>Mommy, where are you?
LAUREN=>Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
SOPHY=>When?
LAUREN=>Soon, baby.
SOPHY=>Mommy, I'm scared.
LAUREN=>There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
LAUREN=>I love y--
MAX=>Can you put that in a bag or something?
SONRISA=>You get it when I get her.
MAX=>Okay...idea. Compromise, right? Bruno here comes with me. He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow. What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
SONRISA=>You better hope you're as smart as you think you are.
BRUNO=>Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know? Comin' off hard.
MAX=>Yeah, sure, I understand.
BRUNO=>I never woulda done it. Probably not, anyway. I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
MAX=>Yeah?
BRUNO=>You're attractive, you're smart. Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
MAX=>Sooo...whattya think? Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date. Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
BRUNO=>Man, you got a bad attitude.
MAX=>I like to keep it professional, that's all.
BRUNO=>Fine. So call her. Get her over here.
MAX=>Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
BRUNO=>What?
MAX=>That's not why we're here.
BRUNO=>What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
MAX=>Geez, you are so stupid the word special comes to mind. They recruit you off the short bus?
BRUNO=>Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
MAX=>You haven't figured this out yet, have you? You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around. You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
MAX=>See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
BRUNO=>You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
MAX=>Sonrisa had no choice but to call me in, 'cause you lack the professional edge, Bruno. Any real pro would've popped me already, the second he saw this thing going sideways, and you're still standing there figuring out what to do. It's pathetic.
MAX=>See. Pathetic.
MAX=>Come on, you're not even trying.
MAX=>Bruno, Bruno, Bruno. Is that all you've got?
MAX=>The man was right, you are a liability.
MAX=>You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
BRUNO=>What're you talkin' about?
MAX=>I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down. Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job. Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
BRUNO=>That's a lotta crap.
MAX=>Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient. It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
BRUNO=>How come I never hearda you before?
MAX=>I'm outta Portland. Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
MAX=>This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
BRUNO=>But the boss knows I always been loyal.
MAX=>He's got exposure. He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
MAX=>Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
BRUNO=>What the hell are you doing?
MAX=>Who's Camille?
BRUNO=>None of your business.
MAX=>This won't hurt. Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D. Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
BRUNO=>Double-crossing sonuvabitch thinks I'd roll on him... I'm gonna do a helluva lot more than that.
MAX=>This is your punk-ass client...
MAX=>I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
VOGELSANG=>Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
MAX=>Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
MAX=>...one-eight-three-two-zero.
VOGELSANG=>Whoa...whoa...slow down...three-two-what was it?
MAX=>Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
VOGELSANG=>Got a pencil?
MAX=>Just give it to me. I'll remember.
VOGELSANG=>One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
MAX=>I'm on my way.
VOGELSANG=>Your best bet's probably to take Fremont to the second light--
LYDECKER=>I want a full perimeter seal. And nobody goes in until I say.
TAC LEADER=>It's one girl. Why don't we just take her when she walks out the door?
LYDECKER=>Listen to me carefully. When you have the streets locked off in front and back, plus the alleys on both sides, and when you have a man on every door, window, airvent, mail slot and rathole around this building, you come back and tell me you're ready. Okey-dokey?
TAC LEADER=>Yes sir.
LEAD THUG=>Get in there you mutt! Hit 'em again. You pussy!
LEAD THUG=>Go! Go! Aw jeeeez, did you see that? You're a waste'a clothes, you punk. I give up.
LYDECKER=>Standby. Full breach on my count. Three, two--
TAC LEADER=>Federal Officers! On the floor! Now!
TAC LEADER=>Drop your weapons! NOW!
LEAD THUG=>No! You drop yours!
TAC LEADER=>DROP THE WEAPONS!!!
LEAD THUG=>Whyn't you come and get 'em!!
LEAD THUG=>Alright! Alright! Alright! Jeeezz!!
LYDECKER=>Tac-One, what's your status? Do you have her or not?
TAC LEADER=>Negative. We do not have the subject. Repeat, we do not have the subject.
BRUNO=>Need to see the boss.
GUARD=>He doesn't wanna be disturbed.
BRUNO=>It's kinda important.
GUARD=>Sorry.
REDHEAD=>Right there... Oooh, that feels good.
SONRISA=>I like you better this way.
SOPHY=>Mommie...
LAUREN=>Sophy...
LAUREN=>Thank you...
REPORTER=>Businessman Edgar Sonrisa was cut down in a hail of gunfire at his Pacific Heights mansion late last night.
REPORTER=>Eyewitnesses identified the assailant as thirty-two year old Bruno Anselmo who died at the scene when bodyguards for the reputed crime boss returned fire. Police are investigating.
MESSENGER=>Delivery for Jam Pony. Need a signature.
MESSENGER=>That'll be a hundred twenty seven dollars.
NORMAL=>For what?
MESSENGER C-O-D.=>From Ratterman's Mortuary.
NORMAL=>You're mistaken--
MESSENGER=>No... Thelonius Argentary at this address.
A.K.A.=>That's Theo in there?
MESSENGER=>Not until I get my money.
NORMAL=>What're you lookin' at me for? I'm not his next of kin. Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
HERBAL=>Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
HERBAL=>Keep your money, mon. We can take care of our own.
MAX=>I'll make sure this gets to his family.
SKETCHY=>Gonna miss Theo.
DRUID=>A righteous dude.
SKETCHY=>So, who gets his bike?
LOGAN=>This has been a Video Free America bulletin via the Eyes Only Informant Net... Peace.
MAX=>See you're back and still rocking the boat.
LOGAN=>Somebody's got to.
MAX=>I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
LOGAN=>Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
MAX=>I'm sorry.
LOGAN=>My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule. Everything happens like it's supposed to.
MAX=>You believe that?
LOGAN=>I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do. So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences. Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
MAX=>Well, not me personally.
LOGAN=>On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone. Once and for all. It was war, Max, and you won.
MAX=>That's what soldiers do, right?
MAX=>What's this?
LOGAN=>Open it.
LOGAN=>It turned up on the black market. One of my sources thought I might be interested.
MAX=>I don't know what to say.
LOGAN=>Deeds, not words. I need your help.
LOGAN=>Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat. Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
MAX=>Look, thank you for this but--
LOGAN=>These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder. The oldest is twelve. The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
MAX=>And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
LOGAN=>You are involved. By being alive you're involved.
MAX=>We're quoting Mom again.
LOGAN=>Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation. But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden. Wasn't s'posed to, but it did. And it's back to the law of the jungle. You got your predators and you got your victims.
MAX=>And you still think you can do something to change that.
LOGAN=>With your help.
MAX=>Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes. But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
LOGAN=>And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot. On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos. I did a search and came up with this.
LOGAN=>That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover. Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery. He escaped from custody after 4 days. Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
MAX=>Zack... He made it... He's alive...
MAX=>I knew it... I always knew he was out there somewhere...
MAX=>Meanwhile, I got Logan on my ass about these people and all their problems and how screwed up the world is and how we gotta go out there and turn the mother around... Like I even care.
