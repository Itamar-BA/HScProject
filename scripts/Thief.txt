VI=>Who is it? Who's there?!
VI=>I thought you're working tonite?
VI=>Forget something you need for work, dear?
FRANK=>I thought you're out getting your hair done? Why's the baby crying?
VI=>Shut up! I know about you!
FRANK=>...this is not the way it's supposed to be.
VI=>I know what you been doing!
FRANK=>Oh yeah? What have I been doin'?
VI=>I figure it out. You weren't at the car lot last night. I checked. You weren't out buying cars and working so goddamn hard at night. You're out screwing some fancy lady! Some whore on the side you're balling, aren't you?
FRANK=>You're crazy. You don't have a clue what I do at night.
VI=>You cheating rat bastard. You son of a bitch. You're out getting laid. Every night!
ROY=>Ohmigod. Ohmigod.
VI=>I am... I am paying you back! I'm paying you back. That's all!
FRANK=>I been true to you since the day we met! I never, ever, since we've been married, been out with another broad! 'Cause that's how it was supposed to be! I been busting my ass! I been doin' a bottle of Bennies a week to keep goin' working day and night! I am popping $1400 a month for the funny farm you got this joint turned into so you can get your hair painted blue in the beauty shop every day with your mother, who so goddamned dumb she can't boil water, taking care of April instead of you. And you got the balls to think I'm out snaking around with the broads!!
FRANK=>You rotten fucking bitch! With April here yet!
VI=>April! Why always fucking April!
FRANK=>I take April. She stays with me! You are completely unfit! You don't give a damn! You are out! You, your mother, your boyfriend stick your face in front of me, or try to hurt or grab the kid -- they find you belly up inna lake.
FRANK=>And you, you stone jagoff! Congratulations! You just got yourself a broad!
FRANK=>Yeah. There ya go. I gotta get you a pet turtle and stuff. How would you like that? Huh? And our own house. With a swing. And a dog. And trees 'cause they rustle at night a lot. Huh?
FRANK=>Coffee.
COUNTERMAN=>Coffee...? Whaddya got? A hollow leg.
FRANK=>Just the coffee, junior.
FRANK=>... how's it now, Mrs. B.?
MRS. B.=>Fine, Mr. Frank.
FRANK=>I have the room next door. We'll move into an apartment in two days. You get hungry, order delivery or whatever. Use the security chain though...
MRS. B.=>Sure. Okay.
FRANK=>Hey, kiddo...
FRANK=>Look at that face, huh? She's into animal cookies. She'll boost a whole box off you...
MRS. B.=>Mr. Frank. You're checking up. Don't worry! Okay? Us girls are getting along just great. Everything's fine and dandy.
FRANK=>Okay. Okay, kid: Daddy's gotta go to work, now.
FISHERMAN=>... Mornin'.

FISHERMAN=>Coldt! Mackerels run where it's coldt.
FRANK=>Wanta Danish?
FISHERMAN=>Yeah. Thanks.

FRANK=>Fifty-nine, D -- flawless, to VSI-1, 1Â½ to 3 karats. $550,000 wholesale, $185,000.
GAGS=>I'll take it myself.

GAGS=>Have someone swing by tomorrow. Look, these people wanna meet you. Stand-up guys.
FRANK=>I don't wanna meet people. What do I wanna meet people for?
GAGS=>Okay, okay. Lemme put some of your end onna street?
FRANK=>Barry will collect it. You down the bread to him. Tomorrow. Ten a.m.
GAGS=>I'm not shitting ya! Double it in three months.
FRANK=>My money goes in the bank. You put your money on the street.
GAGS=>Let me get the check
FRANK=>Forget it.
FRANK=>I thought you were on mornings?
JESSIE=>They switched me to noon to closing.
FRANK=>You like that better?
JESSIE=>Six of one, half a dozen of the other. How's your family?
FRANK=>April's terrific! A year-and-a-half going on 25. That's a nice sweater. What's it, new?
JESSIE=>Yes. Bring them in!
FRANK=>I bring April in here, you are gonna spoil her for life!
FRANK=>Tell Barry to see me when he comes back...
FRANK=>How are ya...
FRANK=>'Dear Frank, nothing new ever happens around here. No, I don't need any money or anything. Go slow and EZ and keep knocking them dead. I could never find the words to tell you how proud I am 'cause you are making your life happen like you said and collecting your debt back from society. And I know you're pretty busy, but could you come up 'cause I gotta see ya. Your pal, Okla.'
FRANK=>What the fuck am I doing?
FRANK=>Hey...!
JESSIE=>Hi. Want me to get you something? Cook left.
FRANK=>No... It's okay. I'm looking for you. What are you doing?
JESSIE=>Waiting for my ride. What do you mean, "looking for me"?
FRANK=>C'mon. I'll take you.
JESSIE=>Mary was...
FRANK=>C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
JESSIE=>Uh. I don't know...
FRANK=>I'm not asking you to go to Florida.
FRANK=>How 'bout some coffee?
JESSIE=>Okay.
FRANK=>And listen: how about tomorrow night we have dinner?
FRANK=>I'm serious. What do you think I'm kidding!
JESSIE=>Uh... Maybe I should've waited for Mary. Look... I don't have relationships. Involvements. Nothing complex... like with married men. Right now... at this time... Okay? How's the car business?
FRANK=>The car business is fine. I'm golden and glowing -- scoring like a champ and becom- ing a big goddamn captain of industry. And, right now at this time I am unmarried, Vi is gone. I am now a free man. And how'd you get an attitude like you got?
JESSIE=>With great difficulty.
FRANK=>You like it on the come and go...
JESSIE=>Free and easy. No expectations...
FRANK=>Then how you gonna keep hanging out with me?
JESSIE FRANK=>What are you talking about? ...cause I am not the kind of guy you come and go from in 10 seconds flat!
JESSIE=>Really! Why not?
FRANK=>Cause I... am like no one you've ever known before.
JESSIE=>C'mon...
FRANK=>I am!
JESSIE=>How?
FRANK=>I... am from another planet.
FRANK=>Planet X. When I got here, I had to learn how to drive a car, work a cigarette machine, what a woman smelled like. You know? I did not know what I was supposed to do.
JESSIE=>Where do you come from, Frank?
FRANK=>Tomorrow night?
JESSIE=>Okay! Okay...
OKLA=>How's it going'?
FRANK=>I'm doin' terrific. Every day's a surprise. But it's... real... fucking weird out there. Not like anything we figured out. On-the-make and on-the-take. Ev-ery-body! Half the merch in all the discount stores in town is hot. Everybody is promoting scores. "Take down this, take that." I put down this score, this chick. A good looking chick takes me aside: "How much you want to whack-out my husband?"
OKLA=>You're shittin' me...
FRANK=>I'm serious.
OKLA=>What did you do?
FRANK=>"Call me in the morning, sugar." I give her the phone number ... of the FBI
FRANK=>How's it goin' with you?
OKLA=>Same old shit. Morris finally busted Red's pruno operation. Lotta knifings...
FRANK=>Dope?
OKLA=>That and sex. They're putting a quality of guy in this place you wouldn't believe. Ten, twenty years ago, woulda dumped 'em inna funny farm. Child molesters, rapists, shit like that in the main stream population. Used to be a guy like that? He lasted five days, woulda been a new world's record. Well, you know. Now?
FRANK=>Nothing's with the wife. I pulled the plug.
OKLA=>What happened?
FRANK=>Vi never knew I am taking scores. A rocket scientist, she figures it out. I'm having affairs with fancy ladies. Right? Gets twisted and screwy.
OKLA=>What are you gonna do?
FRANK=>Put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
OKLA=>April?
FRANK=>She's with me.... I met this new chick. Jessie.
OKLA=>You gonna marry her and have kids?
FRANK=>I think so. But she dunno what I do. I don't wanna tell her. I don't know what to do.
OKLA=>Anyone know...?
FRANK=>Other than Barry and the two, three fences I got business with? No one. I'm the phantom cat. They don't have a clue who's puttin' down my scores. I got two, three years 'til I can split. What do I do? Bullshit her along?
OKLA=>Lie to no one. Someone's close to you? You'll ruin it with a lie. And if they're a stranger, then who the hell are they that you gotta lie to?
FRANK=>What did you want?
OKLA=>Get me outta here.
FRANK=>Eighteen months and you hit the street.
OKLA=>Yeah, well, you know Dr. Shelton?
FRANK=>That lu-lu bastard's killed more guys than the electric chair.
OKLA=>I got angina something something. I ain't gonna last no year and a half. I don't want to die in here, Frank! Not in here.
FRANK=>You got it.
OKLA=>Got to go, kid...
BARTENDER=>Say, Frank. Barry's been calling you.
FRANK=>From where!
BARTENDER=>Three times he called. 532-4234.
BARRY=>Hello?
FRANK=>Where are you?
BARRY=>... the hell you been?
FRANK=>You make the pickup?
BARRY=>I'm in a goddamn phone booth. Try finding one that works in this city. I have not made the pickup. We got a problem. Can you talk?
FRANK=>No. You see our '... man'?
BARRY=>There is no 'man.' He's splattered all over the fucking sidewalk. What do you want to do?
FRANK=>He down the merch?
BARRY=>I was talking to somebody's somebody. I will know in 25 minutes.
FRANK=>Get the work car and meet me at Armitage and Lincoln.
BARRY=>Gags was putting juice loans on the street. Right? For this lice, Attaglia. Gags was pocketing the principal and putting it back onna street for himself -- they went crazy... ba-boom!
FRANK=>Gags down our merch?
BARRY=>At the R.D. Lounge Pauli saw it go down. It was your money that was in Gags' pocket when he went out the window.
RECEPTIONIST=>Can I help you?
FRANK=>I would like to see Mr. Attaglia. You've delivered some zinc plating I had a lotta problems with.
RECEPTIONIST=>I'll buzz you in.
ATTAGLIA=>I'm Mr. Attaglia. You didn't get a delivery or something? Sit down. Zinc what?
FRANK=>My name's Frank. That was bullshit.
ATTAGLIA=>What is this?
FRANK=>This is Joe Gags. $183,300 of my money. We have this problem...
ATTAGLIA=>What are you talking about?
FRANK=>He moved my merchandise. So the money in his pocket before he went out the window is my money... I want my money.
ATTAGLIA=>I don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Frank a-la-la. Whatever. The guy died?
FRANK=>Yes.
ATTAGLIA=>So it goes to probate? Take it up in probate court! Don't bug me with this shit...
FRANK=>I come to discuss a piece of business. And what are you gonna do? You gonna tell me fairy tales?
ATTAGLIA=>Who the fuck are you, Slick? I don't know you. I don't know some clown named 'Gags'! Get the fuck out of here! Beat it! Hey, Carl!!
FRANK=>Hold it!!
ATTAGLIA=>All right! All right! All right! Do what he tells you!
FRANK=>On the floor! Spread your legs! Hands over your head! Now!
FRANK=>Look at the wall!
FRANK=>I'm the last guy you wanna fuck with.
FRANK=>You found my money on Gags! Let's pretend you don't know whose money it is!
ATTAGLIA=>That's right for Chrissake! I mean I don't know who you are! I'll straighten you up! I will!
FRANK=>Three hours. I will call to set a meet. You will pay me my money. $183,300.
ATTAGLIA=>He 'downed merch to Gags' is what he said. I'm telling you this cocksucker's trouble. We whack him out...
LEO=>This the prowler? This the guy Gags had?
MITCH=>Has to be the one.
LEO=>My name is Leo Alderman. How are you?
FRANK=>I'm Frank.
LEO=>Here's your money.
LEO=>All there?
FRANK=>It's there.
LEO=>Don't you say 'thanks' or something?
FRANK=>Whose money was this?
LEO=>Your money. But I kept this guy from giving you a hard time.
FRANK=>Mm-hum. 'Thanks.'
LEO=>You're welcome... it's no big deal.
FRANK=>See ya.
LEO=>Where you goin'?
FRANK=>I'm already late...
LEO=>C'mon, c'mon. I thought we'd talk business. Get to know each other.
FRANK=>Nothing personal but I want to know people, I'll join a fucking country club...
LEO=>But I know you already.
FRANK=>Yeah? How do you know me?
LEO=>The merch you put to Gags and Max Sherman and that Puerto Rican fence, Cotazar? Where do you think they down it? To me. I'm the bank. I handle the fence for half this city. You're putting down two, three scores a month. Month in, month out. And I see your stuff. You got great taste. A regular highline pro. I told Gags, 'I want to meet this guy!' He tell you that?
FRANK=>Yes.
LEO=>Fine.
FRANK=>Let's cut the bullshit.
LEO=>You want to go to work for me? Directly? You'll put down contact scores all over the country.
FRANK=>... I'm self-employed, I'm doin' fine. I don't deal with egos. I'm Joe the boss. What the fuck do I need to go to work for you for?
LEO=>I'll lay it out. You be the judge.
FRANK=>Go ahead.
LEO=>You don't look, you don't case, you don't do nothing no more. We point you to a score, we tell you what's in there. When we tell you it's there, it's there. They are laid-out scores.
FRANK=>How they worked up?
LEO=>Alarm system diagrams. Blueprints. Sometimes the front door key. Sometimes the scores are in on it, everybody's ripping off the insurance company.
FRANK=>Work cars, drops, tools?
LEO=>Whatever you need, you'd see me. I would be your father. Money, guns, cars. I'd be your father from here on out.
FRANK=>What's my end?
LEO=>You get a price. There is no negotiation about the price. We got expenses here you don't have. You'll know the price up front.
FRANK=>How big?
LEO=>Boxcar. Nothing under middle six figures. You'll make a million dollars in four months.
FRANK=>I go to work for you, I'm pulling all this exposure.
LEO=>Our protection trades that off.
FRANK=>I take a bust...?
LEO=>Turn around: there'll be a bondsman and a lawyer there. You'll never spend a night in jail.
FRANK=>Uh-huh... I steal ice. No furs, no coin collections, no treasury bonds, no cartage, no stock certificates, no precious metals. No nothing. Just diamonds. Or cash.
LEO=>Fine.
FRANK=>I work with a partner.
LEO=>We take care of you. A partner is your responsibility. He beefs on you, that's your problem. He beefs on us, that's your problem, too.
LEO=>He is never supposed to know anything about us. Never bring him around. He never meets me.
FRANK=>Who are your inside people?
LEO=>That's my end. It's nothing to do with you. So what do you say, Frank?
FRANK=>I dunno.
LEO=>Whaddya mean, 'you dunno'? C'mon with me!
FRANK=>I dunno! I don't believe in lifetime subscriptions. Maybe this don't fit with my retirement program.
LEO=>What are you gonna do retired?
FRANK=>Pick corn with the chickens and watch daytime TV for the rest of my life. What's the difference?
LEO=>All right! Two, three moves? You wanna keep goin'? Fine. You wanna split? Everybody's businesslike; everybody's an adult. That's fine, too. So let me know. 'Cause you'd be terrific.
FRANK=>I'll call you.
BOREKSCO=>Who is he?
URIZZI=>How the hell do I know?!
JESSIE=>What the hell are you doing here?!
FRANK=>Finding you...
JESSIE=>Forget it. Okay?! You're two hours late. I mean, I don't need this! I don't need a let- down.
FRANK=>Wait a minute!
JESSIE=>Fuck you!
FRANK=>I want to talk to you!
JESSIE=>No!
FRANK=>I'll take you for coffee and explain...!
JESSIE=>Take your goddam hand off me!!
FRANK=>Watch out!
HARRY=>Hey, you!
JESSIE=>You take me anywhere? Forget it.
HARRY=>I'm talking to you!!
FRANK=>Maybe there is a reason!
FRANK=>Ya ever think of that? What is this big goddamn deal! Take a walk, Flash...
JESSIE=>I don't know the reason. I don't wanna hear the reason! There is no 'reason'! It just showed me! That's all!
FRANK=>You were looking forward to this!
JESSIE=>Big mistake!
FRANK=>Jesus Christ!
FRANK=>Get in the car! Don't make a scene!
JESSIE=>No!
FRANK=>Get in the goddamn car!
FRANK=>In what I do there are sometimes pressures.
FRANK=>What the hell do you think I do?
FRANK=>Come on, come on, come on! For five months you and I been saying 'hi' every morning I walk in for breakfast. What do you think I do?!
JESSIE=>A brain surgeon. You sell cars!
FRANK=>I wear 150-dollar slacks, silk shirts and 800-dollar suits, a gold watch and a perfect D-flawless, three-karat ring... ...I change cars like other guys change their shoes.
FRANK=>Hey, baby: I am a thief. I been in prison.
JESSIE=>Congratulations. Why tell me?!
FRANK=>'Cause I didn't tell my wife.
FRANK=>Who is now gone. I ever come on to you? Huh?
JESSIE=>No.
FRANK=>See?
JESSIE=>See what?
FRANK=>See I am a straight. I am a true-blue kinda guy! I been cool. Now I'm unmarried. So we can cut the mini-moves and bullshit and have a big romance.
JESSIE=>You are out of your goddamn mind! You think I'm waiting for you to come along?! Where do you come off with your shit?!
FRANK=>You think I'm kidding. I can tell. This is strictly on the up and up...
JESSIE=>Jesus Christ...!
FRANK=>You're scared to death.
JESSIE=>You are an asshole!
FRANK=>That's lovely. Don't come up into my face!
JESSIE=>I am fine!
FRANK=>Sure...
JESSIE=>You don't know about me! Where I've been. Where I'm coming from?!
FRANK=>Don't shout in here! I know all about you. Inside.
JESSIE=>Bullshit you do!
FRANK=>So then tell me.
JESSIE=>I have put my act together after eight years of a very bad situation. End of story.
FRANK=>Gimme some more coffee here. Sorry... So?
JESSIE=>So nothing.
FRANK=>What was it like?
JESSIE=>Lifestyling. Lot of money. Tucson. Then Mexico City. Culiacan. Bogota. Drifting. Okay?
FRANK=>Okay.
JESSIE=>Lifestyling got twisted and then empty. It was actually over. But we kept moving through the moves. Then it ended badly. Now I get up in the morning, I take a shower, I go to my job. I have a social security card. My life is very ordinary which is good. And very solid.
FRANK=>You are marking time is what you are. You are backing off, hiding out. You are waiting for a bus that's late and hoping it never shows so you won't have to get on and go somewhere.
JESSIE=>You have a license for this?
FRANK=>How much was he moving?
JESSIE=>Nothing. Till towards the end. Then kilo amounts. I don't know.
FRANK=>Then what?
JESSIE=>He's dead.
FRANK=>He... was an asshole.
JESSIE=>There was love and expectations for living a life in the beginning...
FRANK=>He was an asshole for putting you in a box. You know what'd happen to you day and night if you had to do a bit in Columbia?! Jesus Christ!
JESSIE=>Don't shout in here! I was left alone with no money, no clothes, no visa standing on the corner in Bogota, Columbia. "Things" ... did happen. Where were you in prison? Pass the cream.
FRANK=>Joliet. Cream's spoiled ... ... some new cream here. The warden was Joe Reagan.
WAITRESS=>What's wrong with this?
FRANK=>"What's wrong with this?" It's cottage cheese. Joe Reagan. Meatball Joe. If he's a penologist, I'm a jet airplane pilot. I did 11 years. I got out four years ago.
JESSIE=>What did you go up for?
FRANK=>I stole 40 dollars.
JESSIE=>$40?!
FRANK=>It started with a two-year bit, a parole in six months.
FRANK=>Right away I got into a 'problem' with two guys, tried to turn me out. Picked up nine more years on the manslaughter beef. Other things. I was 20 when I went in. 31 by the time I got out. Anyway ... you don't count months and years. You don't do time that way.
JESSIE=>What do you mean? Why?
FRANK=>'Why'? You gotta not give a fuck if you live or die. Forget time. You gotta get to nothing means nothing. When you achieve that attitude, you can survive. I'll tell you a story. All about everything you gotta know about me. Once there was this Captain Morphis: 300-pound slob who couldn't write his name. He had this crew of 16 or 17 guards and cons. Prison group. Crews. They'd go into cells, grab young guys, up to hydrotherapy in the mental wing. Gang bang. Guy puts up a struggle? Beat him half to death. Ends up in the funny farm. Word comes down it's my turn tonight. And I know I am going the route... ... like that. 'Cause nothing means nothing anyway, including myself. If I can get hit on whenever some other guy decides. So fuck it, man. Fuck me. I am dead. 11:30 or 12:00, lights come on. I got this iron pipe from the plumbing. First guard I get his knees. I go through a convict, another convict, a guard, I get Captain Morphis. I nail Morphis right across the head. Twice.
FRANK=>Then they jump all over me and do a lot of things. I'm in hospital section, six months. Morphis is also fucked up real good. good. Cerebral hematoma. They pension him out, he can't walk straight and dies two years later. A real loss to the planet Earth. Meanwhile I'm to go back into the mainstream population. I know the minute I hit the yard I am a dead man from friends, other guards. I hit the yard. Everyone watches me. Guards. Convicts, bosses. You know what happens? Nothing happens. Nothing. Cause I mean nothing to myself. I don't care about me or anything else. And from that day I know ... I survive. Cause I achieved that mental attitude.
FRANK=>Later, I worked this all out...
JESSIE=>What is this?
FRANK=>...in that stone cell. This is what my life will be. No one can stop me from making this happen. 'Cause if it don't... That would be you...
JESSIE=>...who's this old man?
FRANK=>David Okla Bertinneau. A Master Thief. He taught me everything I know about what I do. And I told him about you.
JESSIE=>These are cut out from magazines?
FRANK=>Newspapers. Whatever.
JESSIE=>April?
FRANK=>She's with me. Vi was a flake. She's gone.
JESSIE=>Why the dead people?
FRANK=>Inside you are on ice from time. You can't even die right. Out here: people grow. Get old. Die. Children come after.
JESSIE=>I don't know...
FRANK=>Yes you do...
FRANK=>Look: I lost 11 years. I can't work hard enough to catch up. I can't run fast enough. The only thing that catches me up is doing my Magic Act.
JESSIE=>You'd never know one day to the next whether you're busted, dead or coming home.
FRANK=>Yeah. But it does not go on for forever. It ends right here. When I got this. When I got this here. It ends. I am done.
FRANK=>What you said about 'arrogance'? I cop to it. You know? It's that I got no time. I lost my time. You understand? So I am asking... you: Be with me.
JESSIE=>I can't have children. I don't fit, Frank...
FRANK=>So we adopt... What's the difference? April and another. One to follow each of us. I got to go away. From when I come back, from that point on...
JESSIE=>Frank... I'm not ready... I have my life so...
FRANK=>'...there's nothing in it you can't walk from in ten seconds flat.' What is so terrific about your life. My life's been a mess. Maybe between the two of us we can put something together. That means something. I want you with me and make this happen. So I am asking: Be with me. Be my woman. I will be your man. I got a way... I could make it happen faster, much faster. I'm asking... ...You know?
LEO=>Yeah?
FRANK=>You are on. They gotta be big scores. They gotta be fast. We're talking one or two. Tops.
LEO=>That's it.
FRANK=>Where?
LEO=>Top floor, this side...
FRANK=>Protection?
LEO=>Six independent systems. Five silent ringers into a company over phone lines are infrared pots, magnetics on door and windows, sonic alarm, a pedal hold-up alarm and the vault door's bugged.
FRANK=>What's this?
BARRY=>Top floor. Top of the elevator shafts.
FRANK=>Floors five through ten's phone lines conduit through the elevator shafts.
FRANK=>We chop through the roof and get their lines. Assume we beat the alarms. What's the box?
LEO=>Richmond-Lackett.
FRANK=>Oh that's terrific. It's a burn job.
LEO=>No way to drill?
FRANK=>Drill where? They're custom. No two got the lock box in the door in same spot. We either cut ourselves our own door or forget it. You can beat on that box all day, nothing's gonna happen. And I am exposed. A lot. 14 to 16 hours inside there...
LEO=>Your end covers the risk: $830,000. Four million at wholesale in unmounted stones.
FRANK=>What's the sixth alarm?
LEO=>We cannot run it down.
FRANK=>Why?
LEO=>'Cause it does not go out over phone company lines. But we know it is there... How long?
FRANK=>Four to eight weeks. If I find the alarm and what to cut the box with.
LEO=>I got a couple scores you can put down in the meantime... One's in Miami.
FRANK=>Then I need licenses and a new fleet of work cars. I'll drive down.
LEO=>I'll set it up.
FRANK=>You'll stay here. Get the color codes and make out what the number six is... ... Let's go.
FRANK=>You like it? You think this will do? You sure it's okay?
JESSIE=>Frank: I love it. It's terrific!
JESSIE=>It's super. What are you looking at?
FRANK=>You...that's all.
GROSSMAN=>How ya doin'?
FRANK=>Golden and glowing and scoring like a champ. I need a favor.
GROSSMAN=>How's Okla?
FRANK=>Angina. I'm making moves to get him out of there. I got a hearing fixed up. Who's the guy inna white coat?
GROSSMAN=>Metallurgist. To analyze the scrap metal scientifically. Son-in-law's idea. I bet this putz 100 dollars I come within two percent of what he does with his computer... a load of tubing comes in. I taste it, I chew it, I smell it. I spit it out. 'Hey, scientist cocksucker! 18 percent zinc! 43 percent copper! 38 percent tin! And one percent I dunno!' I'm taking 200 dollars a week from this schmuck. A white coat. Around here he wears a white coat. What's he? Gonna discover penicillin? You gotta be a real putz to wear a white coat around here.
GROSSMAN=>What kind of steel?
FRANK=>Swedish cold-rolled. 247 here, here, here and here in one-inch plates.
GROSSMAN=>Copper to bind drills. Titanium alloy here. This is a well-made and expensive, very special vault... English? Richmond and Lackett?
FRANK=>And I need a very special piece of equipment.
GROSSMAN=>Cut a hole in the lock box?
FRANK=>Each is different. No way to know where to drill. I want to cut me a whole new door and walk in.
GROSSMAN=>Seven. Eight thousand degrees. Portable equipment... ... There's no other way to do it?
FRANK=>No.
GROSSMAN=>Sonny. If I can make something... ... It's gonna be a son-of-a- bitch to use. Okay? So is it worth it?
FRANK=>It's worth it.
FRANK=>You sweep this phone?
GROSSMAN=>Weekly... it's clean.
