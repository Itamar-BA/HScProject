DENBY=>Hello again! This is Chad Denby--remember?--h'mm --Your Master of Ceremonies--coming to you with another program in mid-atlantic--for the benefit of you folks who just tuned in I want to say that the passengers are all comfortably seated--I wish you listeners back there in the small towns and villages could see the life and glamour on this floating palace--We're having oceans of fun--Am I hot tonight!
MARY=>Oh-h, Mister Den-n-by--
DENBY=>Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
MARY=>I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
DENBY=>But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
MARY=>Somebody's got to do it--
DENBY=>Well, let's hear the poem--
MARY=>Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
DENBY=>Very good, Mary--
MARY=>But I'm not finished yet-- --And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you -- --how I love you--
DENBY=>What's the matter, Mary?
MARY=>I'm getting seasick--
DENBY=>H'mm--Dear Atlantic--
MARY=>Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
DENBY=>Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
DENBY=>You are listening to the golden voices of Jean Sargent
MARY=>Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
DENBY=>Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
MARY=>I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
DENBY=>All right. When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
MARY=>When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
DENBY=>Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
DENBY=>Listen to that applause--what other steamship line gives you this entertainment on the high seas? Where is it coming from?--you said it! the Transatlantic Merry- go-round of 1934--What a boat!--A snappy deck-- three hot funnels--a hundred galloping portholes-- and all nice people! Try a trip on our boat for what ails you. Well, this concludes the performance of the At- lantic Follies--Chad Denby signing off until tomorrow night--Good night, folks! DISSOLVE TO:
LOTHER=>Good night, Captain.
CAPTAIN=>Good night, Mr. Lother.
FIRST NAVIGATION OFFICER=>Have you taken the soundings?
SECOND NAVIGATION OFFICER=>Yes, Sir--here's our position now.
SECOND NAVIGATION OFFICER=>We're off the southeastern point of Newfoundland--
NEWSBOY=>Paper!--Extra!--Ballinger breaks jail!
PORTER=>Name and reservation, sir?
LOTHER=>Lee Lother--4C.
MAN=>Escaped again!--More bank robberies!--More hold- ups!--What we need is a police force!
PORTER=>They'll be a lot of shooting before they get that guy again--slippery as an eel.
ANYA=>Wait a minute, porter--my husband's not going aboard.
ANYA=>Going to miss me?
ANYA=>It's all happened so suddenly--I can hardly believe I'm going--
ANYA=>Too bad you couldn't come, too, Herbert.
ROSSON=>As long as we can indulge your whims--somebody in the family has to work. Good-bye, my dear. If I keep those Duluth people waiting another minute, I'll lose the deal.
ANYA=>Don't let me go without the jewel case. The American Express cheques are in there, aren't they?
ROSSON=>You can pick up your letter of credit at Cook's in Cherbourg. Goodbye.
ROSSON=>Get my baggage out of the check room and put it aboard this ship.
PORTER=>Yes, sir--where's your reservation?
ROSSON=>Cabin 108--Second Class--I'll see you aboard.
SALLY=>Take these things to 51C and the other trunk has my name on it just like this.
PORTER=>You get aboard, Miss--I'll take care of it.
SALLY=>It's very important--it has our costumes in it.
VOICE=>Hey, Sally.
DENBY=>The big star of Chad Denby's big seagoing show. We'll have your name up in lighthouses from here to England.
SALLY=>Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
DENBY=>Are you happy?
SALLY=>Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
NED=>I thought I had our sailing covered up--
SALLY=>Do you think Lother could have seen it?
DENBY=>You'd better get on board. I'll take care of the trunks. Hey, porter!
FIRST VAUDEVILLIAN=>Just read in Variety you were sailing. Picked up some of the boys and girls to come down and give you a cheer.
FIRST VAUDEVILLIAN=>Say, these steamship companies are going into the show business in a big way.
SECOND VAUDEVILLIAN=>I should say so--this transatlantic showboat idea is a novelty.
THIRD VAUDEVILLIAN=>I think it's a conspiracy--They want to take all the vaudeville acts out to the middle of the Atlantic and dump them overboard.
FOURTH VAUDEVILLIAN=>Ha! Ha! That's a dirty trick to play on the fish!
FIFTH VAUDEVILLIAN=>Do they pay any kind of money on these big ships?
FIRST VAUDEVILLIAN=>Sixty-two fifty for teams and a hundred and a quarter for quartets.
FIFTH VAUDEVILLIAN=>I wouldn't sing on a rowboat for that kind of dough!
PHOTO JAMES BRETT=>New York Age: 28 Single Occupation: Architect
BRETT=>Thanks.
SHORTIE=>Now listen, Jimmy--!
BRETT=>Not here--follow me around the shed.
BRETT=>Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
SHORTIE=>Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
BRETT=>I thought you were a smart guy.
SHORTIE=>If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on
BRETT=>We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
SHORTIE=>We coulda got two third-class!
BRETT=>No bank roll there, boy. Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
SHORTIE=>Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
BRETT=>It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
SHORTIE=>A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
BRETT=>No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
SHORTIE=>I'll give you half of it. Here's seventy cents.
BRETT=>Nix, the law!
SHORTIE=>Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
BRETT=>He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
SHORTIE=>I'll watch for him, sir.
BRETT=>Thank you, and here's seventy cents for your trouble.
COP=>Just a minute!
SHORTIE=>You speaking to me, sir?
COP=>Can't you read?
FIRST COP=>You ought to know better than that.
BRETT=>Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
SHORTIE=>Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
SHORTIE=>Nix--here comes my boss.
BRETT=>Don't forget that $l.70 change.
SHORTIE=>You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
BRETT=>Shortie, look!
FIRST DETECTIVE=>Well, pleasant trip, Inspector.
INSPECTOR=>Thanks. I've been waiting fifteen years for this vacation. What are you boys doing here?
BRETT=>McKinney!--The smartest dick in Manhattan.
SHORTIE=>You don't think--?
BRETT=>Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked
SHORTIE=>Jimmy, don't!
FIRST DETECTIVE=>We got a tip Ballinger might jump this boat.
MCKINNEY=>Not interested, boys. When I left headquarters this morning--I cut the words "police" and "criminals" right out of my vocabulary.
SECOND DETECTIVE=>Don't blame you, sir--you've earned a rest.
BRETT=>Pardon me, gentlemen--have you noticed a colored man in chauffeur's uniform, carrying a l-a-r-g-e basket of-- fruit?
MCKINNEY=>No, I haven't.
SALLY=>You're darlings to see me off--I'll write you as soon as I get there.
VAUDEVILLIAN=>Coming back on the same boat?
SALLY=>Guess not--we're going to try and line up some kind of bookings over there.
VAUDEVILLIAN=>Well, good-by, beautiful--I've wanted an excuse to do this for a long time.
ANOTHER VAUDEVILLIAN=>Line up, boys!
BRETT=>That was sweet of you.
SALLY=>I'm so sorry!
BRETT=>Want to take it back?
SALLY=>I thought you were one of my friends.
BRETT=>I'd like to be. Sailing on the Progress?
SALLY=>Yes--are you?
BRETT=>I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
SALLY=>She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
BRETT=>I'll say she is!
SALLY=>Nice lines--
BRETT=>Yes--
SALLY=>Like her paint job?
BRETT=>Very much--
SALLY=>You've got lipstick all over you.
BRETT=>I could stand some more--
SALLY=>--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you-- --let me wipe it off.
BRETT=>No! Don't touch it! I want the world to see my shame.
NED=>Come on, Sally.
BRETT=>Who are those flowers for?
MESSENGER BOY=>Mrs. Armitich.
BRETT=>Glad I caught you in time--Mrs. Armitich is not sailing --so give them to my sister--that lady with the beautiful red hair going up the gangplank.
MESSENGER BOY=>But I'm supposed to--
BRETT=>--don't argue or I'll close my account!
BRETT=>--With the red hair--Hurry!
DAN=>Come in, my dear fellow--pull up a chair--delighted to meet you! My name's Campbell.
DRIVER=>Come on--get out of there!
DAN=>Gentlemen--a toast! Here's to--
DRIVER=>He's got a ticket for England--some guy loaded him into my cab.
DENBY=>Mary--I've got a great show for this trip--and with my dry wit and humor--h'mm--a few more trips and
MARY=>With your dry wit and humor--
DENBY=>Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
MARY=>Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
DENBY=>What's he got that I haven't got?
MARY=>Well, he has a straw hat--
DENBY=>So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
MARY=>--And he has sex appeal.
DENBY=>So what?
MARY=>Get that out of your trunk.
DENBY=>All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
MARY=>Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
DENBY=>Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
MARY=>Is that one of the Who's Who?
DENBY=>No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."
DAN=>I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
DENBY=>Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
DAN=>Pretty good--thirty miles an hour--
DENBY=>No. Knots!
DAN=>What?
DENBY=>Knots!
DAN=>I can see you're no gentleman--
MARY=>He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
DAN=>Denby!--Are you Chad Denby?
DENBY=>That's me!
DAN=>Not the real Chad Denby?--
DENBY=>Yes--Me--in person!
DAN=>So what?
MARY=>Where's your dry humor now, Chad?
DENBY=>Be careful--come on--I better pour you on the boat--
DAN=>Nuts to you too!
CAMPBELL=>Steady, old boy--I've got you.
DENBY=>Thanks--I appreciate it.
FIRST POLICEMAN=>He's not there, Inspector--we've searched every inch of the boat.
INSPECTOR=>Okay--Report back to the desk.
BRETT=>Took your time getting here.
SHORTIE=>Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
BRETT=>Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
SHORTIE=>Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
BRETT=>How're the tips?
SHORTIE=>A dollar forty.
BRETT=>I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
SHORTIE=>Not a chance.
BRETT=>Come on-- I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
SHORTIE=>Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
BRETT=>Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
SHORTIE=>Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
BRETT=>Oh, Shortie!-- --there's a girl on this ship--
SHORTIE=>--there's thousands of 'em!
BRETT=>A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
SHORTIE=>This is a business trip!
BRETT=>She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it. Funny--her name's not on the passenger list.
SHORTIE=>Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
BRETT=>Why didn't I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
STEWARD=>Everything in order, sir? What are you doing here, my lad?
SHORTIE=>Telegrams.
STEWARD=>Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
BRETT=>Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
SHORTIE=>No, sir?
BRETT=>My change.
SHORTIE=>Change?
BRETT=>A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
SHORTIE'S VOICE=>Not bad--I'll use these to get even.
BRETT=>Shortie!--you know my motto?
SHORTIE=>Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
BRETT=>Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
SHORTIE=>Now you're talkin'!
LADY=>Boy!
SHORTIE=>Yes, ma'am.
LADY=>Will you come in and fix my porthole?
SALLY=>I'm looking for 48.
SHORTIE=>Right down there, Miss.
DENBY=>Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one-- Oh--you don't like it, eh?
NED=>Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
DENBY=>Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
NED=>No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
SALLY=>Am I a member of this club?
DENBY=>You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
SALLY=>Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo-- Get out of here.
DENBY=>Everything O.K.?
SALLY=>Just what the doctor ordered.
SALLY=>Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
DENBY=>Like it?
SALLY=>Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
DENBY=>Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
SALLY=>And you've put it over--haven't you?
DENBY=>Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all Nice people--
SALLY=>You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
DENBY=>No--not much--excepting--
SALLY=>Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
DENBY=>No--Inexperienced-- A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
SALLY=>I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
DENBY=>Do what--
SALLY=>You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
SALLY=>It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
DENBY=>I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
SALLY=>I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me. I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care-- --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
DENBY=>I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
SALLY=>Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
DENBY=>Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
SALLY=>Chad Denby broadcasting-- --the nicest man I ever knew--
DENBY=>But not nice enough to marry--eh?
SALLY=>Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
DENBY=>I'll never love anybody else.
SALLY=>Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up
DENBY=>Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
BRETT=>Can you give me names of the people in the show?
CLERK=>Well, sir--there's--
BRETT=>--don't bother.
BRETT=>Sally Marsh is the lady I'm looking for--where's her cabin?
CLERK=>51C--around to the left--second tier.
LOTHER=>What stateroom has Miss Marsh?
CLERK=>Miss Sally Marsh?--51C.
LOTHER=>Where would that be?
CLERK=>Around to the left, sir--second tier.
ANYA=>Looking for me?
LOTHER=>Anya!
ANYA=>Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do. We can't stand here.
LOTHER=>Well ... guess we'd better have a drink on it.
STEWARDESS=>The lady is not in her cabin, sir.
ANYA=>You're still surprised, aren't you?
LOTHER=>Anya, I think you're crazy.
ANYA=>Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
LOTHER=>I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
ANYA=>Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
LOTHER=>Do you want the truth, Anya?
ANYA=>It would be a nice change from you.
LOTHER=>I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
ANYA=>You're a charming liar. You know, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
LOTHER=>How'd you ever get away with it?
ANYA=>When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
LOTHER=>Sure!
ANYA=>I never want to go back....
ANYA=>Here's to Europe! Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
LOTHER=>Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
ANYA=>That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
BRETT=>I beg your pardon.
MCKINNEY=>Hello, young fellow. Did you find that basket of flowers?
BRETT=>Fruit!
SUMMERS=>How are you, Mr. Lother?
LOTHER=>This is Jack Summers--Mrs. Rosson.
SUMMERS=>A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
ANYA=>Montana?
SUMMERS=>Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance-- --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
LOTHER=>You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
SUMMERS=>Eh?... Oh.
LOTHER=>He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
SUMMERS=>There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly. I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
ANYA=>Keep your voice down--that blonde boy is looking straight over here.
SUMMERS=>That's him! That's the sucker!!
LOTHER=>Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
PASSENGER=>Something about an ocean voyage that makes everybody happy!
ROSSON=>Not necessarily.
PASSENGER=>Oh! Going over on business, eh?
ROSSON=>--Er--Yes--you might call it that--
AND SUMMERS=>BRETT has Anya's hand, and is looking at her bracelet.
ANYA=>We'll have cocktails and then a few rubbers of bridge.
BRETT=>I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
ANYA=>I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
92-A MEDIUM SHOT=>Suddenly Brett stares--he has seen Sally and for a moment struggles between courtesy and desire.
BRETT=>Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
LOTHER=>We'll be expecting you.
BRETT=>Where have you been hiding?
SALLY=>Oh--hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
BRETT=>Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
SALLY=>So you washed it off!
SALLY=>Good-by.
BRETT=>Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
SALLY=>Good-by!
BRETT=>There's soft music--
SALLY=>--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
BRETT=>Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
DAN=>Hello, Denby!
DENBY=>I thought I put you to bed.
DAN=>Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
DENBY=>Well, did you find me?
DAN=>Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
DENBY=>This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
DAN=>That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
DENBY=>Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank. Where is your wife?
DAN=>She's in New York.
SHORTIE=>Here you are, sir.
DAN=>What'll I say?
DENBY=>Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
DAN=>That's fine.
DAN'S VOICE=>How much will that be?
SHORTIE=>Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
DAN=>How?
SHORTIE=>Where do you live?
SHORTIE=>Your wife knows that, don't she?
DAN=>Sure.
SHORTIE=>Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
SHORTIE=>"Will be back in four weeks"-- --that saves you eighty cents right there!
DAN=>That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
SHORTIE=>Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
DAN=>How?
SHORTIE=>"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
DAN=>That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
SHORTIE=>Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out. "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
DAN=>Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
SHORTIE=>Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where is "Back"?
DAN=>Back is in New York.
SHORTIE=>Your wife knows that, don't she?
DAN=>Sure.
SHORTIE=>Cut it out.
SHORTIE=>Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
DAN=>Send that.
SHORTIE=>Wait a minute--What is next month?
DAN=>Next month is June.
SHORTIE=>Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
DAN=>June? That's my wife's name.
SHORTIE=>That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
DAN=>O.K.! Send that!
SHORTIE=>Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
DAN=>Sure.
SHORTIE=>Well, there's no use in sending it. See that--I saved you seven twenty!
DAN=>Well. I'd rather see you get it than the company.
BRETT=>This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
SALLY=>You're not very ambitious, are you?
BRETT=>Oh, yes, I am, because afterwards--up here in the moonlight.
SALLY=>You work too fast for me, young man.
BRETT=>Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
SALLY=>Never eat before the show.
BRETT=>Well--breakfast? Lunch?
SALLY'S VOICE=>Sorry I'm late.
DENBY=>I was just about to start a game with this gentleman.
MCKINNEY=>McKinney's the name.
SALLY=>This is Mr.--er--
BRETT=>Brett is the name.
SALLY=>Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
MCKINNEY=>I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
BRETT=>Oh, yes. On the pier.
MCKINNEY=>Before that. Your face is very familiar.
BRETT=>Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
MCKINNEY=>No--not quite.
DENBY=>Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
BRETT=>Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
AD-LIB=>Fine! ... O.K.!
BRETT=>Miss Marsh and I will play against you two.
DENBY=>No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
BRETT=>Tell you what I'll do. I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
DENBY=>O.K. Heads you win.
DENBY=>That's too bad.
BRETT=>I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
DENBY=>I'm sorry to hear that.
SALLY=>I think you're very unkind.
YOUNG FELLOW=>I'm awfully sorry.
DENBY=>That's perfectly all right. Don't mention it.
DENBY=>What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
SALLY=>I don't get the humor of that remark.
DENBY=>He does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
BRETT=>Is there a bump on my head?
SALLY=>Don't feel any--yes, I do!--Oh--that's a shame.
BRETT=>Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
SALLY=>You are a lunatic!
BRETT=>Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
BRETT=>You know, you're not a bad-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
SALLY=>Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
BRETT=>Married?
SALLY=>Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
BRETT=>I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
SALLY=>What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
BRETT=>Tell me.
SALLY=>A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
BRETT=>--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
DENBY=>Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket-- What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
MCKINNEY=>Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
DENBY=>Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game. Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
MCKINNEY'S VOICE=>Nice shot!
MCKINNEY=>You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
DENBY=>Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
ANYA=>Feeling a little better, I see.
BRETT=>Yes, yes--the air-- --I'm getting plenty of air. Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
SALLY=>How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache. --and it's so noisy up here.
ANYA=>Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise. Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
BRETT=>Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
ANYA=>Sooner--if you like. See you again, I hope.
BRETT=>Isn't she attractive?
SALLY=>Very--your mother?
BRETT=>Don't be a c-a-t.
SALLY=>You asked me to dine with you tonight.
BRETT=>Yes?
SALLY=>Well, I can't.
BRETT=>Don't rub it in.
SALLY=>But I'll have cocktails with you.
BRETT=>When?
SALLY=>At seven-thirty?
BRETT=>Sooner it you like.
SALLY=>Okay.
BRETT=>Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
SALLY=>Wrong again-- But I dislike possessive women.
MCKINNEY=>No! no! You trimmed us. The drinks are on me. That's funny, I must have left my wallet in the cabin.
DENBY=>That's all right. I'll attend to this.
BRETT=>Wait a minute--let's match for it.
DENBY=>Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
SALLY=>Well--thanks for the game and the drinks, and now if you'll excuse me--
BRETT=>See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
SALLY=>I'll be there--Good-by.
MCKINNEY=>Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
DENBY=>It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
MCKINNEY=>He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
DENBY=>It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
MCKINNEY=>Oh no--I don't want to impose on you-- It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it-
FIFTY-DOLLAR BILL=>PULL CAMERA BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT. Brett is in his cabin in Tuxedo trousers and dress shirt. He hands the bill to Shortie who looks slightly surprised.
SHORTIE=>Where'd you get the dough?
BRETT=>Inspector McKinney.
SHORTIE=>Are you screwy?
BRETT=>I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
SHORTIE=>You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
BRETT=>Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
SHORTIE=>You take some awful chances.
BRETT=>Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
MCKINNEY=>Will you cash a fifty-dollar American Express check for me?
SHORTIE=>And will you please give me thirty one's and two ten's for this?
PURSER=>There you are, sir.
MCKINNEY=>Thank you.
PURSER=>Thirty one's and two ten's?
SHORTIE=>Yes, sir.
LOTHER=>Can you read 'em Jack?
SUMMERS=>They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--
LOTHER=>The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
SUMMERS=>The country boy's about due.
LOTHER=>Better unlock the door. Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
SHORTIE=>Here y'are. Now don't take too many chances on that card game.
BRETT=>They won't squawk--they're professionals.
SHORTIE=>Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
BRETT=>That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
LOTHER=>And don't forget--you won't play cards because you've got a headache. After the three of us get started you can scram. Give him the come-on--let him win the first few hands. When I give you the office --Start taking him.
SUMMERS=>--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
ANYA=>Isn't that interesting?
SUMMERS=>Come in!
BRETT=>Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
BRETT=>Oh, boy--
BRETT=>Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
SHORTIE=>Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
ANYA=>Good afternoon--
BRETT=>Glad to see you again.
ANYA=>Do you mind if I don't play? I've a beastly headache.
LOTHER=>But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
ANYA=>I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something. Shall I see you tomorrow?
BRETT=>I hope so.
ANYA=>That's a date.
ANYA=>You'll excuse me.
SUMMERS=>Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
BRETT=>If you gentlemen play a heavy game, perhaps you'd better count me out.
BRETT=>I never play higher than--say a $200 limit.
LOTHER=>We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
BRETT=>Not at all.
BRETT=>I'll bet a couple of hundred-- I wonder what's keeping that boy.
SUMMERS=>Don't worry about that. We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
BRETT=>Three Jacks.
SUMMERS=>That beats two Pairs. I'm glad I didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
BRETT=>Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
LOTHER=>If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
SUMMERS=>Well, as I said before, I don't like to win the first pot. Out my way in Montana we're very superstitious--we always say a good beginning is a bad ending. I hope that won't apply to you.
SHORTIE=>Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
BRETT=>Thank you. I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
SHORTIE=>Thank you, sir.
BRETT=>I'll take one.
SUMMERS=>One will be enough for me.
LOTHER=>I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.
BRETT=>I'll bet a couple of hundred.
SUMMERS=>Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.
LOTHER=>Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
BRETT=>Aces full.
LOTHER=>And me coming in with two pair--
SUMMERS=>I thought my straight was O.K., but--
SUMMERS=>It's your deal.
BRETT=>It's a pleasure.
LOTHER=>Come in!
SHORTIE=>Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
BRETT=>What is it?
SHORTIE=>Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
BRETT=>Oh, is she? What a shame! You'll pardon me?
LOTHER=>You're coming back--
BRETT=>That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
LOTHER=>How much did you lose?
SUMMERS=>About twelve hundred.
LOTHER=>I went for four.
SUMMERS=>It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
SHORTIE=>What did you win?
BRETT=>About sixteen hundred.
BRETT=>Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella-- Here's that twenty-five hundred.
BRETT=>See that Miss Sally Marsh gets that bouquet with my card immediately.
BRETT=>If there's any change, keep it.
FLORIST=>Thank you. I'll attend to it right away.
SALLY=>Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
NED=>(turns and pats her hand affectionately--he smiles to
SALLY=>Aren't the roses beautiful?
SALLY=>Hello! ... Yes, it is. ...
SUMMERS=>This is the ship's photographer speaking--could I get a couple of pictures of you for the Radio News? ... Thanks very much ... Cabin 4C ... Right away? ... Thanks.
SUMMERS=>She's comin'.
LOTHER=>Beat it.
DAN=>Don't you hate a pest?
BRETT=>I certainly do--
DAN=>So do I. There are times when a fellow likes to be alone.
BRETT=>I'd like to be alone right now.
DAN=>So would I. Let's sit down and talk it over.
BRETT=>Will you try and locate Miss Marsh, please?
STEWARD=>Yes, sir.
LOTHER=>Well--aren't you going to say something? I've gone to a lot of trouble to give you this little surprise. Don't let's behave like children. Sit down, Sally. Let's face the situation.
SALLY=>All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
LOTHER=>You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
SALLY=>I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
LOTHER=>It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
SALLY=>Why don't you leave me alone?
LOTHER=>Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place. I want you more now than I did that first night-- You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
SALLY=>I wish I could.
LOTHER=>Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
SALLY=>You get wise to yourself! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
LOTHER=>That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire. How about Ned?
SALLY=>He's all right.
LOTHER=>Thanks to me.
SALLY=>You leave the kid alone.
LOTHER=>A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
SALLY=>--you'd go with him!
LOTHER=>Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
LOTHER'S VOICE=>Why do you think he's aboard?
LOTHER=>Of course not-- --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
SALLY=>You can't bluff me any more.
BRETT=>I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell, but I'm waiting for someone. I'd appreciate it if you'd--
MARY=>Oh, there you are--
DAN=>That's right--you're the one I was looking for. You'll excuse me. How about you and I being alone?
MARY=>Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
DAN=>Let me see now--Don't tell me-- You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
MARY=>Never mind.
DENBY=>H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
MARY=>Oh, all right-- See you later, Toots.
DAN=>Nobody is any help to me at ail.
BRETT=>Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
DENBY=>No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
BRETT=>She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
DENBY=>I would--but our rehearsal starts right away. Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
126A MEDIUM SHOT--CORRIDOR=>Denby meets Ned, on way to rehearsal room.
DENBY=>Seen Sally?
NED=>She went over to the ship's photographers.
SALLY=>I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it. What do you want me to do?
LOTHER=>Just smile again and be reasonable. I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
SALLY=>--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
LOTHER=>That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
SALLY=>Don't, Lee--that's dead.
LOTHER=>Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
LOTHER=>So it's as cold as that, is it?
ANYA=>Hope we're not intruding.
LOTHER=>This is Miss Marsh.
ANYA=>Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances. What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
ANYA=>Well--shall we go into dinner?
LOTHER=>I'll join you later.
ANYA=>And do bring Miss Marsh-- --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
SALLY=>You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
ANYA=>Sorry I can't return the compliment.
SALLY=>You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening-- --and he was gentleman enough to boast why you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
ANYA=>I don't understand.
SALLY=>I think you do.
SALLY=>I was jealous of you then--I'm sorry for you now.
ANYA=>So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York. Oh--there's no accounting for tastes-- Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
LOTHER=>I can explain--
ANYA=>Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
SUMMERS=>Will you pardon me?
ANYA=>Gladly.
LOTHER=>Scram!
ANYA=>Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette. What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
LOTHER=>Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
ANYA=>Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
LOTHER=>You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
ANYA=>Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
LOTHER=>I didn't ask you to come away with me--
ANYA=>Oh--a hundred times--
ANYA=>And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert. Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you. You're such a swine!
LOTHER=>Will you leave me alone?
ANYA=>I like touching you--poison ivy. You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
LOTHER=>Baloney!
ANYA=>No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
ANYA=>Let me wipe it off for you. I adore you--you gorilla!
LOTHER=>And I'm nuts about you-- --beautiful!
ANYA=>I couldn't live without you!
MARY=>Why don't you answer my question?
BRETT=>I didn't even hear it.
MARY=>Then I'll repeat it.
MARY=>If spinach makes iron, what makes a boat rock?
BRETT=>Who cares?
MARY=>I'll have to tell that to Denby. He'll use it on the radio.
DENBY=>I don't know what it is, but I won't use it. Is she entertaining you?
BRETT=>I should say not.
DENBY=>Good! At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
STEWARD=>No, sir--she's not on the upper deck either.
BRETT=>Thank you. You'll excuse me, please--
BRETT=>Oh, Sally!
SALLY=>I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
BRETT=>You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
SALLY=>I must say you're persistent-- --it's kind of flattering.
BRETT=>You're unhappy about something, aren't you?
SALLY=>A little.
BRETT=>Sorry.
SALLY=>Thanks.
BRETT=>Anything I can do? I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
SALLY=>Mighty decent of you, pal.
BRETT=>Decent? I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
SALLY=>What are you thinking?
BRETT=>A lot of things I'd like to forget.
SALLY=>That's funny--so was I. Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
BRETT=>I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
SALLY=>You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
BRETT=>Can you keep a secret? You're the first girl I ever met I wanted to build a fence around.
SALLY=>Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
BRETT=>For once I'm dead on the level-- --crazy about you!
SALLY=>Will you take some advice? If you're looking for romance--count me out-- --if you know what's good for you.
BRETT=>But--
SALLY=>--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon. Guess I'll be going.
BRETT=>Sally--!
SALLY=>Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
BRETT=>You mean that?
SALLY=>Don't let's talk about it.
BRETT=>You said it! How about a little action?
VOICE=>Sandwiches?
SUMMERS=>There's the chump--over there--
LOTHER=>I wonder!
SUMMERS=>How's your mother feeling?
BRETT=>Much better--thank you--
LOTHER=>How about a little game later?
BRETT=>Fine--I'll be glad to.
BRETT=>Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
ANYA=>We'll save you a place at our table.
BRETT=>Thanks.
SHORTIE=>What's up?
BRETT=>The ice is in the storage.
BRETT=>Keep a lookout, Shortie--
MCKINNEY=>Oh, boy!
SHORTIE=>Yes, sir.
MCKINNEY=>Can you tie a bow tie?
SHORTIE=>Yes, sir--
MCKINNEY=>What's your hurry, young feller?
BRETT=>I'm going to the show--
MCKINNEY=>I'll go with you--
DENBY'S VOICE=>Wait a minute--
DENBY=>That's enough, boys-- That was fine, Frank--you've already sung a verse and chorus, and everybody enjoyed it--I hope--Now I have a good idea--sit down, Frank, Mary, Jean.
DENBY=>Here's the idea--we're going to reverse things around here--you've entertained the audience, and now for a change they're going to entertain you-- aren't we?--I'll sing the chorus up until I get to the words, "Oh, Leo," then I'll put the spotlight on some lady or gentleman, and whoever the lucky one might be, he or she will then sing the words, "Oh, Leo--Oh Leo-- Oh Leo--Oh--"
DENBY=>We'll try it once-- Play, boys!
SARGENT=>They are applauding the audience.
DENBY=>That was fine, folks--now we'll try it again.
MARY=>Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
DENBY=>Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
DENBY=>The next act will be Sally Marsh and her troupe of trained adagio dancers.
NED=>No--but I'm going to tell her as soon as the act's finished.
BRETT=>Isn't she lovely?
ANYA=>Yes--and very popular--
NED=>What's the matter, Sally?--you're shaking.
SALLY=>I'm all right.
NED=>You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
SALLY=>I was in his cabin--
NED=>What!--are you crazy?
SALLY=>I'll explain later--
NED=>If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
SUMMERS=>Now that the entertainment is over, how about a little game of cards?
BRETT=>Care to join us?
MCKINNEY=>No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
SUMMERS=>You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
ANYA=>I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
LOTHER=>Excuse me, gentlemen--I'll see you at the card game--
SECOND PASSENGER=>And, gentlemen--I'm going home, because my wife is going to have a baby.
THIRD PASSENGER=>I'm on my honeymoon--
FIRST PASSENGER=>How about you--why are you on the boat?
ROSSON=>I'm going to kill a man.
FIRST PASSENGER=>Was he kidding us?
ANYA=>A very valuable bracelet of mine's been stolen!
PURSER=>Where did you have it last?
ANYA=>In my cabin. I didn't wear it this evening--when I went downstairs just now, I found the lock of my jewel box broken open.
ANYA=>A bracelet's been stolen from my cabin!
MCKINNEY=>Where is your cabin?
WAITER=>This is my job--you've got no business in here--
BRETT=>This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
MCKINNEY=>Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
BRETT=>It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
MCKINNEY=>Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
BRETT=>If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing-- Bet I could find that bracelet--
MCKINNEY=>I wouldn't be surprised--
PURSER=>Mrs. Rosson, was the bracelet insured?
ANYA=>Yes--for $10,000--
PURSER=>If you'll give me the details in the morning, we'll notify the insurance company--and rest assured if it's on the boat we'll locate it--
BRETT=>I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up-- How about a nightcap, Inspector?
MCKINNEY=>No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
BRETT=>Good night!
ANYA=>He's a nice boy--
MCKINNEY=>Yes--he's very naïve--
SUMMERS=>Did you find it?
ANYA=>No!--Did you take that bracelet?
SUMMERS=>No-o!
ANYA=>Where's Lother?
SALLY=>Do you mind getting out of here now--I want to change--
LOTHER=>Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
SALLY=>I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
LOTHER=>Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
SALLY=>Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
LOTHER=>I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
BRETT=>Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
SALLY=>Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
SALLY=>This time I'm really glad you showed up.
BRETT=>Lonesome?
SALLY=>We'll let it go at that--
DRESSING ROOM=>Ned meets Lother coming out of Sally's cabin-- he stops momentarily--then rushes into Sally's cabin--he sees that Sally is not there--he comes out quickly--
NED=>What are you doing around here?
LOTHER=>Take it easy--you'll last longer--
NED=>Why don't you leave Sally alone--you dirty--
DENBY=>What happened to you?
NED=>You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
DENBY=>What for?
NED=>Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
DENBY=>Easy kid--easy.... Come on--I want to talk to you.
BRETT=>That's a beautiful moon, Sally?
SALLY=>What, again?
BRETT=>Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
SALLY=>What?--
BRETT=>I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
SALLY=>I didn't know we were going to be married.
BRETT=>You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
SALLY=>You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
BRETT=>I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
SALLY=>I think we ought to walk.
180A CLOSE-UP--SHORTIE=>In companionway--He sees McKinney go into Brett's room.
BRETT=>Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
SALLY=>It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
MCKINNEY=>Good night!
BRETT=>Good night, Mrs. Brett!
SALLY=>Good night, idiot!
MCKINNEY=>How about you?
BRETT=>No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
MCKINNEY=>You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
BRETT=>Why?
MCKINNEY=>Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
BRETT=>Sure, I'll go.
MCKINNEY=>I'll go with you.
BRETT=>Swell!
PURSER=>Well, you insist--
BRETT=>How about trying your fine Italian hand?
MCKINNEY=>This has nothing to do with me-- But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this-- --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--here--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
BRETT=>Hey!--you're tickling me.
MCKINNEY=>Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string. See what I mean, Purser?
PURSER=>Very interesting.
BRETT=>Well, I guess that's all--good night!
PURSER=>He's certainly good-natured.
MCKINNEY=>"Smooth's" the word.
PURSER=>I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
MCKINNEY=>It all depends on what you're used to.
MCKINNEY=>Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
PURSER=>What's the matter?
MCKINNEY=>Nothin-- --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
SHORTIE=>This is the first chance I've had to get away to tell you --McKinney was snooping around in this cabin last night.
BRETT=>It's O.K., Shortie--it's still there. Better bring it in.
SHORTIE=>What're you goin' to do with it?
BRETT=>You keep it--
SHORTIE=>Me!
BRETT=>Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
BRETT=>See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
BRETT=>Large package of Luckies--Good morning, Inspector!
MCKINNEY=>Hello, young fellow!
BRETT=>Coming to the pool for a swim?
MCKINNEY=>Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading. I'll take this one.
190A CORRIDOR=>McKinney exits from cigar stand to where Chad Denby has been watching. Denby greets him with--
DENBY=>Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
MCKINNEY=>Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
DENBY=>I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
MCKINNEY=>Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
DENBY=>Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
MCKINNEY=>Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
DENBY=>Maybe he just travels in bad company.
MCKINNEY=>Yeah--
BRETT=>Tell me--did you find your bracelet?
ANYA=>No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
BRETT=>Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
BRETT=>Strike out harder with your feet--now exhale as your arms go back.
BRETT=>I thought you were never coming--
SALLY=>I could see you were pining away--
BRETT=>Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
SALLY=>Yes--I remember--
SALLY=>How well do you know her?
BRETT=>Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
SALLY=>Who with?
BRETT=>A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
SALLY=>Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
BRETT=>Lose?--I won a little--
SALLY=>That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
BRETT=>What do you know about them?
SALLY=>Too much--Remember--I warned you about me-- I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
BRETT=>You can live that down, can't you?
SALLY=>He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him! Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
BRETT=>You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
SALLY=>I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
BRETT=>Come on--let's take a swim.
STEWARD=>Blime!--wot's that yer got?
SHORTIE=>Nothin'.
STEWARD=>Let me look at it.
SHORTIE=>Ain't got time.
STEWARD=>Hey--you! Where you going?
STEWARD=>Stop him! Stop him! He's got the bracelet!
SHORTIE=>I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
STEWARD=>I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
SHORTIE=>Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
STEWARD=>Then why did you run away?
SHORTIE=>Because you ran after me.
DENBY=>Take your places, folks. The winner of this horse race will be presented with a handsome autographed ocean wave.
SALLY=>I want a new horse. His front legs are full of rubber.
DENBY=>Come on, get up. That horse is carrying too much of a load.
DAN=>Who won?
DENBY=>Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
DAN=>I was never stiffer in my life.
DENBY=>All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the
DENBY=>I forgot my gun. I'll drop this handkerchief instead-- Get ready--One!--Two!--Three!
BRETT=>Come on, Sally. Bet you a hundred dollars she wins!
MCKINNEY=>Wouldn't bet against her. Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France. Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
BRETT=>It's a bet--come on, Sally!
DENBY=>The winner, Sally Marsh! And-- --Dan Campbell-- --wins by a sliver!
MCKINNEY=>Nice girl, that-- I'd hate to see her get a raw deal. You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're too smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
BRETT=>Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
LOTHER=>Could I see you a minute?
BRETT=>Sure! Excuse me.
MCKINNEY=>Congratulations.
SALLY=>Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
MCKINNEY=>He'll be back. What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
SALLY=>Say, "Thanks very much!"
MCKINNEY=>I mean if you knew it were stolen.
MCKINNEY=>And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
SALLY=>Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
MCKINNEY=>Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
LOTHER=>Well--when are we going to have our little poker game?
BRETT=>Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
SUMMERS=>Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
BRETT=>Why isn't that a good time to quit?
LOTHER=>No gentleman would do that.
BRETT=>I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would-- --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
SUMMERS=>I thought you were a sucker--
BRETT=>Think again--
LOTHER=>In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
BRETT=>Oh, no--I played with your cards--in your cabin--at your suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
LOTHER=>I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a rough voyage.
SUMMERS=>That goes two ways.
BRETT=>Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
LOTHER=>And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
BRETT=>I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh. --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
BARBER=>Quite a growth, sir--been seasick?
BALLINGER=>Yes--leave the moustache on--
MCKINNEY=>Boy--let me have that radiogram blank--
STEWARD=>Pardon me, sir--that table's reserved--
BALLINGER=>I've been in my cabin--ill--this is the first time I've come to the dining room.
STEWARD=>You can sit over here tonight, sir--I'll have the Chief Steward allot you a table tomorrow--
CAMPBELL=>I tell you--my dress clothes have been stolen!--
STEWARD=>--but I laid 'em out on that bed for you, sir!
CAMPBELL=>I know you did! I went to take a shower and when I came back they'd gone--even the shoes.
DENBY=>Serious?
SALLY=>Yes.
DENBY=>Very serious?
SALLY=>Very--
SALLY=>Why--don't you like him?
DENBY=>Of course--but-- There's your cue--hurry up--
LOTHER=>Say, Denby--how soon before Sally'll be through? I've got a date with her.
DENBY=>I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
LOTHER=>What do you mean?
DENBY=>Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
LOTHER=>Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
DENBY=>I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
LOTHER=>Meaning what?
DENBY=>You don't shoot squirrels.
228-A BACKSTAGE=>The music comes to a finish. Denby exits out of scene applauding à la master of ceremonies, to
LOTHER=>Oh, Sally!
LOTHER=>Are you going to meet the blonde?
SALLY=>That's my affair.
LOTHER=>I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
SALLY=>Not a chance--I'm through.
230-A MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT=>Brett as Sally enters to him.
SALLY=>I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
BRETT=>Make it five.
SALLY=>Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
CLOSE SHOT--OFFICER'S HAND--=>Still pointing to New York. Slowly he retraces the course.
FIRST NAVIGATION OFFICER'S VOICE=>... dead on time as we passed the point light-- --twenty-four hours ago--38€, 41€-- --and here we are off the southeastern point of Newfoundland--fifty-eight hours out--
CAPTAIN=>Open the door!
CAPTAIN=>What happened?
SALLY=>He followed me into my cabin, locked the door and as he started to come toward me I heard two shots--That's all I know--
CAPTAIN=>Inspector, for the first time in the history of this line a passenger has been murdered. Won't you please take charge?
239-A OUTSIDE BAR=>Dan just coming out as McKinney runs by. Dan turns and goes back into bar.
MCKINNEY=>All right, Joe. Get up out of there.
MCKINNEY=>Where'd you get it?
BALLINGER=>Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
MCKINNEY=>What did you want a gun for?
BALLINGER=>Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
MCKINNEY=>Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
BALLINGER=>Guess again, copper.
MCKINNEY=>Get moving--
243-A OUTSIDE BAR=>Dan is just coming out of the bar again as McKinney, holding his gun toward Ballinger passes. Dan turns and staggers back into the bar.
MCKINNEY=>All right, spill it!
BALLINGER=>I didn't do it.
CAPTAIN=>Who is he?
MCKINNEY=>A rat with a long tail. Take him below--I'll get back to him later. I'll have to ask you all to leave.
MCKINNEY=>Captain, I want you to get the following passengers in your office--
THE PURSER'S OFFICE=>The lights of the cabin are burning. The ship has run into a dense fog. Throughout the following scene the screaming of the siren is heard intermittently. Sally is seated facing McKinney, her face drawn after a sleepless night. McKinney also looks tired. He has undone his tie and loosened his collar. Now that he is back in harness he doesn't spare himself.
SALLY=>That's the truth--every single word!
MCKINNEY=>I sincerely hope so--
SALLY=>Why should I kill him?
MCKINNEY=>For a very excellent reason from your own admission-- --I'm not saying you did--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
BRETT=>Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you--
MCKINNEY=>Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
MCKINNEY=>Where were you when the murder happened?
SUMMERS=>In my cabin playing solitaire.
MCKINNEY=>Oh, you couldn't get a friendly little poker game together, eh? Still sticking to the same story, Marsh?
NED=>Yes, Yes!
MCKINNEY=>You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
NED=>No!
MCKINNEY=>S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
NED=>I wouldn't say that-- I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
MCKINNEY=>Why?
NED=>Because I was yellow, I guess--
BRETT=>Don't get yourself all worked up--
NED=>I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
MCKINNEY=>This is interesting-- Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
DENBY=>I didn't--
MCKINNEY=>He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
DENBY=>Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
MCKINNEY=>Is this your gun?
DENBY=>Yes!
MCKINNEY=>Mmmmmmmmmhm.... Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
BRETT=>Why, I--
DENBY=>Just before the shots! Why, he was with me--backstage --we ran down together when we heard them.
STEWARD=>The lady in cabin--has been killed!
MCKINNEY=>Are you sure?--
VOICE=>That's right, Inspector!--
ROSSON=>She's dead!--I killed Lother too!
251-A CLOSE SHOT--DENBY--NED--SALLY=>Denby enters scene where Ned is standing with his arm around Sally.
DENBY=>Take her to her cabin--she's all in.
BRETT=>Thanks for establishing an alibi for me. If that guy hadn't confessed I would have been on the grill plenty, and I don't think I could have weathered it. Get me? Any time I can do you a favor don't hesitate to ask for it.
DENBY=>I won't--I'll ask for one right now. Sally tells me she's in love with you.
BRETT=>She did?
BRETT=>Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
DENBY=>O.K., kid-- I'm only sorry for one thing.
BRETT=>What's that?
DENBY=>If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--
SHORTIE=>Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
BRETT=>Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
SHORTIE=>Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
BRETT=>Where did you hide it?
SHORTIE=>On the drunk.
BRETT=>Get it!
CAPTAIN=>Well, Inspector--now that that's over--you can go back to your vacation.
MCKINNEY=>Not quite yet. There's still a loose bracelet floating around here somewhere.
BRETT=>There comes a time in every guy's life when he has to stand off and take a look at himself. I've been doing that tonight--and what I saw is pretty phony.
BRETT=>Now you know. If you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you.
MCKINNEY'S VOICE=>Sorry to intrude.
MCKINNEY=>Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
SALLY=>I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
MCKINNEY=>I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
BRETT=>I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
SALLY=>Jimmy!
BRETT=>Well, I'll be--!!!
SALLY=>What's the matter?
BRETT'S VOICE=>Hey--wait a minute!
BRETT=>Here's your fifty.
MCKINNEY=>Thanks. That makes us square.
MCKINNEY=>Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
SALLY=>He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
DENBY=>This is the Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round program signing off--station W-A-V-E--Chad Denby speaking.
MARY=>Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
DENBY=>Good-night, folks.
