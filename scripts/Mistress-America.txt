TRACY=>Um, I have trouble with procrastinating.
TRACY=>That was really nice of you... waking me up.
TONY=>I was going go get frozen yogurt, want to come?
BROOKE CARDINAS=>She quickly presses that name...
BROOKE=>I’m an autodidact. Do you know what that means? TRACY
TRACY=>I’ll look here.
BROOKE=>You got a honey? TRACY
TRACY=>That’s clever. BROOKE
TRACY=>It’s so stylish. BROOKE
TRACY=>Oh my God, yeah. BROOKE
TO WATCH?=>Are you still there?
TRACY=>I didn’t mean - I know people will come to yours. It’s so weird to think that every restaurant I see is the result of some person going “I think I want to start a restaurant.”
TRACY=>Yeah, it was... The best of my life.
RUTH=>Shut up please.
BROOKE=>Hey Baby Tracy!
EVERYTHING AM I RIGHT?!=>I know not enough people have told you that you’re amazing. I know that that’s true.
BROOKE=>
TRACY=>That’s so nice. BROOKE
AWFUL.=>I used to run around with her. Well, she was older, is older.
BROOKE=>You’re welcome.
MOTHER FUCKING SHIT.=>She kicks the door and screams.
RUTH=>My uncle died.
PSYCHIC=>OK, Brooke, I’m ready...
PSYCHIC=>I am seeing this, yes. I am seeing... trees...
BROOKE=>It’s win win. Because I’m sure he still loves me.
TONY=>I’m not rich.
TONY=>Nicolette! You SCARED THE FUCKING SHIT OUT OF ME!
BROOKE=>Well, I kind of stalked them once. I was so pissed.
40’S MAN=>This is the house.
TRACY=>Hi, I’m Tracy.
TONY=>Tony - and wait, no don’t tell me - Mamie-Claire?
NICOLETTE=>Goats are more sustainable. They’re smaller.
LIVING ROOM=>Nicolette and Tony are looking at a chess set. Pregnant women are leaving. Mamie-Claire is seeing her guests out.
KITCHEN=>Mamie-Claire comes back into the kitchen cleaning up.
DAD=>Are you okay?
DAD=>Who’s Tracy?
DYLAN=>Do you have to put your face so close to mine?
DYLAN=>Let me make you a drink. What’s the opportunity?
BROOKE=>It’s a good one.
MAMIE-CLAIRE=>Because we “owe” her!
NICOLETTE=>You brought me a Chipwich?
KITCHEN=>Brooke finds herself standing next to Karen.
BROOKE=>That’s awesome for you. I never went to college.
LIVING ROOM=>Dylan, Mamie-Claire, Tony, Karen and Tracy sit on the couch in front of an elevated stage which is usually used to project movies. Brooke stands behind a curtain. Tracy presses a button and the curtain slowly opens. Brooke appears before them. Brooke backs up and kind of gets a little presentational about the whole thing.
LIVING ROOM=>Tony is working on the apple bong with his all-purpose tool, Tracy watches him.
KITCHEN=>Brooke has followed Dylan into the kitchen, he’s fixing a drink.
BROOKE=>He’s right. I think I even feel a little relieved.
HAROLD=>What IS it about this house? Everyone screams.
DYLAN=>Ladies, ladies. KAREN
MAMIE-CLAIRE=>Is that a real thing?
DYLAN=>Who wouldn’t want to write a story about Brooke?
PLEASE! PLEASE FRIENDS! SOMEONE=>DEFEND ME AGAINST THIS MONSTER!
MAMIE-CLAIRE=>And I want you to answer these questions, not for our satisfaction, but for your own. One: Do you believe in the women’s right to choose?
MAMIE-CLAIRE=>To your own feelings.
KAREN=>No, sweetheart.
MOM=>Oh, honey, don’t cry, you can still be friends...
KAREEM=>She’s upstairs.
TRACY=>You’re leaving?
BROOKE=>This won’t even be your big “college story.”
TRACY=>But what she couldn't see most of all, more than she couldn't see that she was never going to get the restaurant, was that those people were nothing compared to her. They were matches to her bonfire. She was the last cowboy - all romance and failure. The world was changing and her kind didn’t have anywhere to go. Being a beacon of hope for lesser people is a lonely business.
