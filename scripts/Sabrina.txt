DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID:=>SABRINA:
DAVID:=>Gretchen? What do you call this, mixed singles? GRETCHEN: Oh no, don't... no. Whatever you do, you have to stay on your side of the net.
DAVID:=>GRETCHEN: Now, David, you know the rules of the game. DAVI
FAIRCHILD: SABRINA: FAIRCHILD: SABRINA: FAIRCHILD:=>to go to Paris.
SABRINA: FAIRCHILD:=>If your mother were alive, she'd be very happy to know
SABRINA: FAIRCHILD:=>cook, did it, Sabrina? I'll wake you at seven. The boat goes at noon. Good night. SABRINA:
LINUS:=>Come on, out of there.
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA:=>missing. I wanted to find out which one it was.
LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>father know about this?
SABRINA:=>LINUS:
LINUS:=>Now, deeper. SABRINA:
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>of carbon monoxide? It kills people. SABRINA:
LINUS:=>I hadn't come along? I'd have died.
SABRINA: LINUS:=>And fast. Eight cars! One would have done it. It's a good thing Mrs. Van Horn asked me to drive her home.
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>garage doors open. You understand? A chauffeur's daughter should know better. SABRINA:
CHEF:=>Yesterday we have learned the correct way, how to boil water. Today we will learn the correct way, how to crack an egg. Voila, an egg!
ERNEST:=>It's Mr. Linus, Tom. He is ready to go into town. MARGARET: What about David? What's she say about David?
FAIRCHILD: BUTLER: FAIRCHILD:=>of David very much any more."
JENNY: FAIRCHILD: BUTLER: FAIRCHILD:=>David's picture." That's good.
ERNEST: FAIRCHILD:=>"Could you please airmail me some Scotch tape." MARGARET: That's bad.
LINUS: FAIRCHILD: LINUS:=>FAIRCHIL
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>DAVI
LINUS:=>Dear David, this is to remind you that you are a junior partner of Larrabee Industries. Our building is located at 30 Broad Street, New York City. Your office is on the 22nd floor.
LINUS: FAIRCHILD: LINUS: FAIRCHILD:=>But she'll get over it.
CHEF:=>you have learned the lesson of the soufflé. The soufflé, it must be gay. Gay, uh, like two butterflies dancing the waltz in the summer breeze. Tra-la-la-la...
CHEF:=>Three seconds. Two seconds. One second. To the ovens!
CHEF:=>You are exaggerating. Fair. So-so. Sloppy. Mmm! Superb! My dear Baron, you have not lost your touch.
CHEF: SABRINA: BARON:=>the oven.
SABRINA:=>Oh! I have been watching you for a long time, Mademoiselle. BARON:
SABRINA:=>Does it show?
BARON:=>Very clearly. A woman happily in love, she burns the soufflé. A woman unhappily in love, she forgets to turn on the oven. Am I correct?
SABRINA: BARON:=>a bad cough.
SABRINA:=>reaching for the moon. That's quite a moon. Oh, you young people. You are
BARON:=>so old-fashioned! Have you not heard? We are building rockets to reach the moon. To begin with, you must stop looking like a horse.
SABRINA:=>Horse?
FAIRCHILD:=>here for a refresher course in soufflés and liked me so much he decided to stay on for the fish."
MARGARET: BUTLER:=>FAIRCHIL
SERVANTS: DAVID: BUTLER: DAVID:=>MARGARET: Wouldn't you like to read it, Mister David? There's something about you in it.
FAIRCHILD: BUTLER: JENNY:=>with him. He is?
FAIRCHILD: JENNY:=>Mmm-hmm. Number four. MARGARET: Who says so?
JENNY:=>society columns?
DAVID:=>McCARDLE:
DAVID:=>McCARDLE:
DAVID:=>McCARDLE: lawyers on the plastics deal.
DAVID:=>I'll break that door down using you as a battering ram! McCARDLE: DAVI
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>I'm really steamed. LINUS:
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>The girl is Elizabeth Tyson of the Oyster Bay Tysons."
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>Elizabeth Tyson. You like her, don't you?
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>LINUS:
DAVID: LINUS:=>a scratch on it. Say, I wonder how this would stand up against a bazooka. Miss McCardle, ask General Stanton on Governors Island and ask if we can borrow a bazooka. McCARDLE:
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>marrying Elizabeth Tyson!
LINUS:=>that!
DAVID:=>I've had it three times.
LINUS:=>because for once you're gonna settle down and do something constructive. Taste it.
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>to do with the fact the Tysons own the largest holdings of sugar cane in Puerto Rico, would it?! LINUS:
LINUS:=>You make it sound so vulgar, David. As if the son of the hot-dog dynasty were being offered in marriage to the daughter of the mustard king. Surely, surely you don't object to Elizabeth just because her father happens to have 20 million dollars? That's very narrow-minded of you, David.
DAVID:=>and she hasn't accepted. Oh, don't worry. I proposed, and Mr. Tyson accepted.
LINUS:=>Did you kiss him?
DAVID: LINUS:=>Now look, David. Elizabeth is one of the loveliest girls around. Sooner or later you're gonna propose to her anyway. I'm only trying to help you make up your mind.
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>married, I'd have to take a Dictaphone, two secretaries and four corporation counselors along on the honeymoon. I'd be unfaithful to my wife every night of my married life with vice presidents, boards of directors, slide-rule accountants... This... this is my home. No wife would ever understand it.
DAVID:=>world.
LINUS:=>were all there was to business, it'd hardly be worth while going to the office. Money is a by-product.
DAVID:=>Well, what's the main objective? Power? Ah! That's become a dirty word.
LINUS: DAVID:=>Well, then, what's the urge? You're going into plastics now. What will that prove?
LINUS:=>something of use to the world. A new industry moves into an undeveloped area. Factories go up. Machines are brought in. A harbor is dug, and you're in business. It's purely coincidental, of course, that people who've never seen a dime before, suddenly have a dollar. And barefooted kids wear shoes and have their teeth fixed and their faces washed. What's wrong with a kind of an urge that gives people libraries, hospitals, baseball diamonds and, uh, movies on a Saturday night? Miss McCardle, will you send in the secretaries? McCARDLE:
DAVID:=>Elizabeth, some kid's gonna be running around Puerto Rico barefoot with cavities in his teeth.
LINUS:=>of it. You'll wear a suit made of it and before we're through with it, you'll probably be able to eat it. We're organizing Larrabee Plastics. Larrabee Construction is ready with the blueprints. Larrabee Shipping bought nine more freighters to handle the traffic.
DAVID:=>LINUS:
LINUS:=>Mr. David, please?
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>ladies.
LINUS:=>so we can get in on this year's sugar crop.
DAVID:=>LINUS:
SABRINA:=>Dearest Father, we shall be graduating next week and I shall be getting my diploma. I want to thank you now for the two most wonderful years of my life. I shall always love you for sending me here.
SABRINA:=>La Vie en Rose. It is the French way of saying, "I am looking at the world through rose-colored glasses" and it says everything I feel. I have learned so many things, Father. Not just how to make vichyssoise or calf's head with sauce vinaigrette, but a much more important recipe.
DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID:=>who are you? Who am l?
SABRINA: DAVID:=>Am I supposed to know? Come to think of it, no, you're not supposed to know.
SABRINA: DAVID:=>Are you stranded? SABRINA: My father was supposed to pick me up, but something must have happened. DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID:=>I believe in, it's "Love thy neighbor."
SABRINA:=>Come on, David. DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID:=>SABRINA:
DAVID:=>SABRINA:
DAVID:=>lived here?
SABRINA: DAVID:=>Shore.
SABRINA: DAVID:=>Let me see your profile again. I know I know you. I have a feeling I've seen you ... with your father. Wait a minute. Is your father Admiral Starratt?
SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID:=>companies?
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>drive into town together. DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID:=>SABRINA:
SABRINA: DAVID:=>"Haven't we met somewhere before?" We have met some ...
DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID:=>SABRINA:
JENNY: BUTLER: MARGARET: SABRINA:=>MARGARET: Look at you! You're such a lady. You've come home such a beautiful lady!
BUTLER: SABRINA:=>There's nothing to cry about. I brought you a hat, Margaret. A real Paris hat for you to wear to church on Sundays. And Jenny, I've got something for you.
SABRINA: FAIRCHILD:=>Larrabee to the hairdresser.
SABRINA: FAIRCHILD: SABRINA: DAVID: MARGARET:=>Sabrina? SABRINA:
FAIRCHILD:=>them upstairs.
DAVID:=>us should have a reunion.
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID:=>El Morocco, we'll mosey on down to the Village. You like Dixieland bands?
SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>DAVI
FAIRCHILD:=>SABRINA:
DAVID: SABRINA:=>I'll get the dress out and press it. See you tonight.
SABRINA: DAVID:=>recognized her? That scrawny kid who used to whip around corners every time she saw us coming. Her knees always painted with Mercurochrome. How do you like those legs now?
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>the family 25,000 dollars.
SABRINA: FAIRCHILD:=>letter ...
SABRINA: FAIRCHILD: SABRINA:=>FAIRCHIL
SABRINA:=>Real Napoleon Brandy. And this is for you to wear on your day off.
FAIRCHILD: SABRINA: FAIRCHILD: SABRINA: FAIRCHILD:=>And you're still the chauffeur's daughter. And you're still reaching for the moon. SABRINA:
DAVID:=>ELIZABETH: Ten more days. It'll seem more like ten years.
DAVID: ELIZABETH:=>the reception, but I said definitely not. I certainly don't want to spend the first 18 hours of my honeymoon in a plane, sitting up. Do you?
DAVID:=>ELIZABETH: David!
DAVID:=>ELIZABETH: Aren't you interested? DAVI
OLIVER:=>the evening. They look like barbers.
DAVID:=>Hmm? ELIZABETH: I think I ought to have a talk with your chauffeur.
DAVID:=>ELIZABETH: Father wants to give me either a Bentley or a Mercedes as a present, and I thought your chauffeur'd be able to tell me which ...
DAVID: ELIZABETH: DAVID:=>Elizabeth. Don't bother. ELIZABETH: All right, darling. I know you'll take care of everything.
ELIZABETH: DAVID:=>ELIZABETH: No, thank you, darling. DAVI
DAVID:=>Uh, will it wash out, Elizabeth? ELIZABETH: Oh, yes. It isn't bad.
DAVID:=>LADY GUEST: Come on, Elizabeth. I'll help you. ELIZABETH: All right.
DAVID:=>SABRINA:
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID:=>SABRINA:
MAUDE:=>MRS. TYSON: I wonder what happened to Elizabeth.
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>to all your parties.
DAVID: SABRINA:=>DAVI
DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID:=>What a fool I was!
SABRINA: DAVID:=>SABRINA:
FAIRCHILD: JENNY: BUTLER:=>see how she can breathe. And the way they look into each other's eyes ...
FAIRCHILD:=>MARGARET: Oh, Tom, you ought to be happy for her. This is what she wanted. This is where she belongs.
FAIRCHILD:=>the chauffeur on the Harrington estate? His daughter fell in love with the son of the house. And the first thing he knew, he was driving the family to the church, changing his uniform and walking down the aisle to give the bride away. That's not for me. I don't like it.
MAUDE: DAVID. MAUDE: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID: MAUDE: SABRINA: MAUDE: DAVID: SABRINA:=>Have I really changed?
MAUDE:=>You certainly have. You look lovely, Sabrina.
DAVID:=>Doesn't she, though? I thought it would be fun to ask her to the party as a welcome home. Ya... You know, kind of a welcome home.
SABRINA:=>the station. MAUDE: Did he? How nice of him. DAVI
SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA:=>just watching from that tree.
DAVID:=>let you go away again.
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID:=>SABRINA: Yes. A nice, steady kiss. Not on roller skates this time.
DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>because you were teaching me to skate backwards. Suddenly, you kissed me. I've never forgotten.
DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID:=>meet you at ...
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>Romantic?"?
DAVID:=>Naturally.
ELIZABETH: LINUS:=>out of circulating. Thank you.
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>DAVI
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>DAVI
OLIVER:=>of the family! What have I done now, Father?
DAVID: OLIVER:=>Now, I'm not saying that all Larrabees have been saints. There was a Thomas Larrabee who was hung for piracy, and there was a Benjamin Larrabee who was a slave trader, and there was my great-great-uncle Joshua Larrabee who was shot in Indiana while attempting to rob a train. But there never was a Larrabee who behaved as David Larrabee has behaved here tonight!
DAVID: OLIVER: LINUS:=>OLIVER: No gentleman makes love to a servant in your mother's house!
DAVID:=>She is not a servant.
OLIVER:=>She's a servant's daughter. And in behaving as you have, you've embarrassed not only your mother but also our chauffeur. I have too much respect for Fairchild never to intrude on his personal life, and I expect you to have the same respect for his daughter.
DAVID:=>her to the party.
OLIVER:=>I love her!
DAVID: OLIVER:=>He loves her! Next thing we know, he'll lean a ladder up against the garage wall and elope with the girl in the middle of the night!
DAVID: OLIVER:=>engaged man and merely remind you of your marital record to date. I know, Father. I've made three mistakes.
DAVID: OLIVER:=>First, that Hungarian countess who only married you to bring her family over. A mother, a father and five brothers. All of them badly in need of costly dental repairs.
DAVID: OLIVER:=>Register, and she has the audacity to wear on her wedding dress not a corsage bu, bu, but a Stevenson button!
LINUS:=>OLIVER: Th, Th, then that great actress! Turns out all she does is commercials on television for an underarm deodorant. Poof, poof, poof, poof. And now, our chauffeur's daughter.
DAVID:=>waiting.
OLIVER:=>to say.
LINUS:=>them, Father. I think you're being a little unfair to David.
OLIVER: LINUS:=>if he decides Sabrina's the girl for him ...
OLIVER: DAVID: LINUS:=>DAVI
LINUS:=>love her, take her. This is the 20th century.
OLIVER:=>blindfolded and get a better one! You'll get rid of that girl immediately, do you understand? And apologize to your fiancé!
LINUS:=>civilized people. Sit down, David. DAVI
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>understands me.
DAVID: OLIVER: DAVID: OLIVER:=>DAVI
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>I serve it up there or will you come down? Up there? All right.
SABRINA: LINUS:=>Sabrina. Either you're under eight cars looking for a missing spark plug or you're perched up here umpiring a tennis match between two players who aren't there. Oh, you look lovely, Sabrina, and very grown up. I'd better get back to the party.
SABRINA:=>And leave me here alone?
LINUS:=>What did David say?
SABRINA: LINUS:=>I don't know what you did to him, but I haven't seen him in such a state since he was kicked in the head by a polo pony at Old Westburry.
SABRINA: LINUS:=>forgotten he's engaged. He wants you.
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>thrown open and a lovely breeze swept through this stuffy old house. How could I object?
SABRINA:=>of the garage? LINUS:
LINUS: SABRINA:=>"10,000?" "No." LINUS: 15,000 kronen? SABRINA: No. LINUS: 25,000 kronen? SABRINA: No. LINUS: 25,000 dollars? SABRINA: No. How did dollars get into this? LINUS: 25,000 dollars after taxes, that's a lot of money, Sabrina. SABRINA: What are you trying to say? LINUS: I'm just trying to make it worthwhile. What's a krone these days? No self-respecting Prime Minister would offer kronen.
SABRINA:=>LINUS:
LINUS: SABRINA:=>zeppelin with everybody singing like mad.
LINUS:=>SABRINA:
LINUS:=>There it is. The song they were playing the night
SABRINA:=>before I went away. David was right here dancing it with somebody else. Tonight I wanted it to be me. LINUS:
OLIVER:=>have been removed?
DOCTOR:=>glasses.
DAVID:=>Owe!
DOCTOR:=>Now I cannot possibly be hurting you. The area has been anesthetized. DAVI
LINUS: SABRINA:=>wouldn't you?
SABRINA:=>LINUS:
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>LINUS:
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>Sabrina mad because I didn't show up?
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>stood up like a man.
DAVID: LINUS:=>DAVI
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>ran it off at the factory this morning.
DAVID: LINUS:=>plant.
DAVID: LINUS:=>On your feet.
DAVID:=>I live. What do you think of Sabrina?
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>to her, but I, I can't seem to finish it. What rhymes with 'glass'?
LINUS: DAVID:=>LINUS:
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>her up in a dumbwaiter?
LINUS: DAVID:=>to spoil it, would we?
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>keeping an eye on Sabrina for me?
LINUS:=>I'm taking her sailing this afternoon.
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID:=>LINUS:
DAVID:=>us the moment Dr. Calloway takes the stitches out. Well, then, you've already made up your mind?
LINUS:=>Absolutely. This is it.
DAVID: LINUS:=>Yes. Well, I, I just wanted to make sure because this has been it three times before.
DAVID:=>we were kids. I just couldn't see her for the tree.
LINUS: DAVID:=>she'll buy three new hats. Mother will go to bed with a severe headache and the latest Mickey Spillane. And Father will take to the bottle openly and smoke six Corona-Coronas and then threaten to exile me to Larrabee Copper in Butte, Montana. And that's where you come in, Linus.
LINUS: DAVID:=>help me, aren't you?
LINUS:=>DAVI
DAVID: LINUS:=>to play. ELIZABETH: I still don't understand what those glasses were doing in your pocket?
DAVID:=>somebody waiting. Er, there was a game going on. ELIZABETH: In the dark? In the middle of the night?
LINUS:=>DAVI
DAVID:=>ELIZABETH: Shall we play three-handed?
LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>are out.
DAVID: LINUS:=>So long, Elizabeth. So long, Scarface.
LINUS: OLIVER: LINUS:=>clothes closet.
OLIVER:=>that girl over the garage?
LINUS: OLIVER: LINUS:=>I just don't want him to run off with the plastics merger.
OLIVER: LINUS: OLIVER:=>tell her to forget about David.
LINUS: OLIVER: LINUS: OLIVER:=>she be in love with someone else?
LINUS: OLIVER:=>LINUS:
OLIVER: LINUS: OLIVER: LINUS:=>OLIVER: Oh, no! LINUS: What's the matter? OLIVER: Not you, Linus! LINUS: Hey, look, do you think this is any fun for me? I've got a whole desk full of work I was planning to clean up over the weekend, and I'm supposed to be in Texas on the sulphur deal. The whole Puerto Rican operation has to be set in motion in the next 48 hours.
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>SABRINA: Yes, we have no bananas, we have no bananas today. How did they think of those words? LINUS:
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>better, thank you. Now he's flat on his back.
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>SABRINA: Certain songs bring back certain memories to me, too. Did you love her?
LINUS:=>SABRINA: I'm sorry.
LINUS: SABRINA:=>woman. I always thought you walked alone.
LINUS: SABRINA:=>the garage. Coming and going, always wearing your black homburg, carrying a briefcase and an umbrella. I thought you could never belong to anyone, never care for anyone.
LINUS:=>suite. No emotion, just ice water in his veins, and ticker tape coming from his heart. And yet one day, that same cold businessman, high up in a skyscraper, opens the window, steps out on a ledge, stands there for three hours, wondering if he should jump.
SABRINA: LINUS:=>hard to believe someone might want to blot out everything, for sentimental reasons?
SABRINA:=>of sentimental reasons? I... I went to Paris to blot it out. Maybe you should go to Paris, Linus.
LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA:=>changing your outlook. For throwing open the windows and letting in ... letting in la vie en rose.
LINUS:=>35 minutes.
LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>to be on it. SABRINA:
LINUS:=>secretaries, sick of this office. I'm breaking out, Sabrina. I'm running away.
SABRINA: SABRINA:=>it. It's all your fault, Sabrina.
SABRINA:=>double your money back. Oh, Linus, I'm so glad you're going. Or am l?
LINUS: SABRINA:=>McCARDLE: The Colony. I got you the darkest corner. I'm sorry, Mr. Larrabee.
LINUS: SABRINA:=>something. LINUS: Oh, never resist an impulse, Sabrina, especially if it's terrible. SABRINA: I'm going to do it.
LINUS:=>like you? Who'll be there to help me with my French? To turn down the brim of my hat?
SABRINA:=>A perfect stranger.
LINUS:=>I have a better suppose, Sabrina. Suppose I were ten years younger. Suppose you weren't in love with David.
DAVID:=>but not in my car.
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA: DAVID: LINUS:=>Room. DAVI
SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA: LINUS:=>DAVI
LINUS: DAVID:=>LINUS:
DAVID: LINUS: DAVID: LINUS:=>like to see the stock exchange and our plant in Jersey.
SABRINA: LINUS:=>DAVI
SABRINA: DAVID: SABRINA:=>DAVI
SABRINA:=>DAVI
LINUS: ELIZABETH:=>indoor pool to make room for presents.
MR. TYSON:=>capital to controlling interest? LINUS: Page 62 paragraph six, uh, subdivision B. ELIZABETH: Father, where's the list? MR. TYSON: Here you are, darling. ELIZABETH: Would you like to see the invitation list?
LINUS: MR. TYSON:=>of each other.
LINUS:=>ELIZABETH: Come on, Father. Oh, Linus, you won't forget the gardenias now, will you?
LINUS: ELIZABETH:=>over the chapel and throw rice at us from his plane. MR. TYSON: With David the bridegroom, maybe he'd better use wild rice.
OLIVER:=>I never can remember that garage girl's name.
LINUS: OLIVER:=>"Sabrina"?
LINUS: OLIVER:=>that situation in hand?
LINUS:=>export deal. And next Miss McCardle, I want two accommodations on the Liberté. One in the name of Sabrina Fairchild, one in my name.
OLIVER:=>on a boat together? Have I spawned two idiot sons?
LINUS:=>I am going, but I'm not really going. Is that clear? It is not!
OLIVER: LINUS:=>I'm going to tell Sabrina that I'll meet her on the boat. When the boat is ten miles out at sea, she'll find out that I'm not on the boat.
OLIVER: LINUS:=>few presents to soften the blow.
OLIVER: LINUS:=>Miss McCardle, I want flowers in Miss Fairchild's cabin. Candy, fruit and the usual what- have-yous. Next, cable Miss Show to get her a car in Paris, also an apartment. Next, a letter of credit on our Paris bank. She can draw up to 50,000.
OLIVER: LINUS:=>Larrabee Common. 1,000 shares?!
OLIVER:=>Make it 1,500 shares, Larrabee Preferred.
LINUS: OLIVER:=>Seems to me there ought to be a less extravagant way of getting a chauffeur's daughter out of one's hair.
LINUS:=>olive out of a jar.
LINUS:=>McCARDLE:
LINUS:=>McCARDLE:
LINUS:=>eight.
SABRINA:=>I should have called you earlier. I can't see you tonight. I'm very sorry I just can't make it. I tried but I'm all tied up. No, I'm not in Long Island. I'm in New York. Oh, downtown in a phone booth in a building. What difference does it make, what building, Linus? I, I can't see you tonight. Oh, all right, it's, it's the Larrabee Building, but I'm not coming up.
LINUS:=>on your mind, slowly and clearly? You talk and I'll listen.
SABRINA:=>what I mean, don't you, Linus? Linus? Hello, Linus? Where are you, Linus? Your three minutes are up.
LINUS: SABRINA:=>Oh, hello. This is silly, I was talking to myself.
LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA:=>you tonight. LINUS: Not here, Sabrina.
SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA:=>LINUS: Would you like a drink?
SABRINA:=>LINUS:
LINUS:=>Why don't you sit down? SABRINA: I can only stay a minute.
LINUS:=>SABRINA: If you want. LINUS:
SABRINA:=>LINUS:
LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>for 21 tonight. I've spoiled your evening, Haven't I?
SABRINA:=>No, you haven't. We can have dinner right here.
LINUS:=>Let's see what Miss McCardle is hoarding. Probably maraschino cherries and stale crackers.
LINUS:=>tomato juice, tomato juice.
SABRINA: LINUS:=>SABRINA: I suppose so. I'm a graduate cook, you know. I have a diploma. LINUS:
LINUS:=>Pots. Pans. Can opener. Stove. All the comforts of home. You know, Miss McCardle once cooked dinner here for the board of directors. After the first course, there was a move to adjourn. It was passed unanimously. What do we start with?
SABRINA:=>I haven't decided yet.
LINUS: SABRINA:=>LINUS:
SABRINA:=>And I've been in love with David all my life. I can't understand what's the matter with me. I went away to grow up and I thought I had grown up, but I guess I haven't really. I just got myself a new hairdo, that's all. Please say something.
LINUS:=>SABRINA: I don't know. Tell me I'm imagining things. Tell me you never even thought of taking me on the boat to Paris with you. Tell me to put on my coat and go home before I make a complete fool of myself. But don't let me go home. I couldn't bear it. This is the last time we'll see each other. I'll behave, Linus. I'm all right now.
LINUS:=>SABRINA: I just remembered I didn't have any lunch today. LINUS:
SABRINA:=>LINUS: That may account for a lot of things. SABRINA: Would you like a soufflé for dessert? LINUS: Out of tomato juice? SABRINA: Out of crackers, of course. LINUS: Not too soggy, huh? SABRINA: You'd better get out of the kitchen.
SABRINA:=>LINUS: The one on the right.
SABRINA:=>LINUS: I'll try not to. SABRINA: You haven't forgotten my instructions, have you? Never an umbrella in Paris, and under all circumstances rain the very first day.
LINUS:=>a yellow pencil. "Ma soeura un crayon jaune."
SABRINA:=>crack. New egg. It's all in the wrist. There must be an egg beater somewhere.
LINUS:=>SABRINA: I know why you didn't tell me. Because you think it's wrong. They'll say I'm too young for you, there'll
LINUS:=>I was going to send you.
SABRINA: LINUS:=>SABRINA: But there's a ticket for you.
LINUS: SABRINA: LINUS:=>SABRINA: I think I understand.
LINUS:=>SABRINA: But why? Why did you do it, Linus?
LINUS:=>plaque on the Larrabee Building. You got in the way.
SABRINA: LINUS:=>SABRINA: How inconsiderate of me. And how inconvenient for you, such a busy man, having to waste so much time to get me on a boat.
LINUS:=>SABRINA: And I suppose, in your empty cabin, there would have been a farewell note, dictated to and typed by Miss McCardle? And perhaps a few flowers. LINUS:
LINUS:=>1,500 shares of Larrabee Preferred for your father.

LINUS:=>DAVI
DAVID:=>love with her! What are you waiting for?
DAVID:=>and a tugboat standing by at the Larrabee pier. Get moving! LINUS: Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, it appears I have a previous engagement.
