BEN=>Phone books.
SAMANTHA=>No, yeah, I get it.
ZOE=>Sold out. We just ordered two hundred more.
JULES=>See if you can cancel that. Just say “Sold Out”. It’s more exciting.
JULES=>Hold on. What?
DORIS=>That’s adorable. JASON
DAVIS=>Floater. Love!!!
BEN=>Hi. I’m Ben. Whittaker. I have a 3:55 appointment with Miss Ostin.
BEN=>It’s a Senior Intern Program. Just started today.
BEN=>Seventy. You?
JULES=>-- You’re saying you don’t want to be transferred?
JULES=>Doesn’t matter.
IN THE AFTERNOON=>Ben is at his computer, getting familiar with the CTF site. He looks over his bifocals and sees the ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSING with Jules inside. He rolls his chair back, looks out the window and sees A DRIVER standing next to an SUV, stomp out a cigarette. Jules EXITS THE BUILDING and heads toward the car.
SEVEN P.M.=>The office is emptying for the night. Davis, slips on his jacket, heading out.
DAVIS=>You’re staying?
JULES=>Okay? Seriously?
BECKY’S DESK=>Ben awaits his orders. As always, Becky is on her headset, overwhelmed, juggling a zillion things.
CANDICE=>Gilt Groupe brought in a CEO, how are they doing?
BECKY’S DESK=>Ben passes by with Jules's jacket. Becky stops typing.
BEN=>I couldn’t say. BECKY
MOMENTS LATER=>Ben is on-line at his desk when a LOVELY PAIR OF HANDS begin massaging his shoulders.
JULES'S MOM=>I hear you typing... We’ve been studying women under 40 who sleep less than six hours a night...
JULES=>Okay. Love you.
SLAM=>Jules, safe in the backseat of the car, catches her breath.
BEN=>That was fast.
JULES=>Not fast enough.
THE KITCHEN=>The only room downstairs that’s been finished. Long open shelves, an island, a farm table. Pots and pans are on the stove. Play-doh spread across the island.
BECKY=>Okay, so you remember?
BEN=>Let’s do it.
THE CAR DOOR SLAMS=>Jules hits the backseat hard.
BEN=>Sure. Thanks. I noticed a couple of hours ago you had a meeting with another possible CEO. Saw him arrive. How’d that go?
JULES=>... Phone books?
JULES=>
JULES=>Favorite music?
BEN=>Love Clancy. Ludlum. Crazy about Harry Potter.
JULES=>No, I’m good.
JASON=>You do. So much. BECKY
DAVIS=>In Philadelphia.
BEN=>I feel like everybody’s uncle around here...
BEN=>-- Not really. Not one that takes me to San Francisco. If you want the company, I’d love to go. JULES
BEN=>Definitely.
JULES'S MOM=>Typing and ringing....
JULES=>Okay. Love you.
JULES=>No no no no no!
TOO MANY FLOWER POTS=>Sit at the back door. The Boys start lifting them all. Davis finds the key. The KEY IS INSERTED into the LOCK. As soon as the Boys ENTER THE KITCHEN, they hear a BEEPING SOUND. They look around, SPOT AN ALARM KEYPAD on the wall.
ANGLE JULES=>rushing outside of the Conference Room, on her cell
BACK AT THE HOUSE=>Davis ENTERS THE KITCHEN, without the computer. Shrugs.
JULES=>Yes! Delete it! LEWIS
BEHIND HIM WE SEE=>Lewis, Davis and Ben, SPRINTING to the car. When they reach the car, the doors are LOCKED. They bang on the car doors. Jason doesn’t react. Davis THROWS HIMSELF on the hood of the car.
BEN=>Not at all. You’ve had a stressful day.
MILES=>Thank you dear. Wowza.
BEN=>
BEN=>Like a clone.
BEN=>Is it the sky?
BEN=>You have a great kid, Jules. She was adorable.
JULES=>It’s a thing I do when I land. We’re good now.
JULES=>Thanks for escorting me back. Want to see my room?
JULES=>I got a weird one for you. Matt is cheating on me.
JULES=>Thanks. FUCK!!!
BEN=>Oh, don’t...
JULES=>
MATT=>Wow. Really? Congratulations. JULES
BECKY=>Check this out.
MATT=>Because of me?
