MALE VOICE=>What's wrong?
THX=>Nothing.....nothing really. I just feel kind of lousy. I need something stronger.
MALE VOICE=>If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance. CALL 348-853
THX=>Yes.....Thank you, I'll be all right. I'm all right.
FEMALE VOICE=>For more rapid results use your new D code on your Mercicontrol card. Thank you.
MALE VOICE=>What's wrong?
MALE VOICE=>What's wrong?
LUH=>....never mind. I'll replace these later.
CLOSE ANGLE=>A bald man dressed in white, huddles in a bare, dimly lit room, Two large leather clad policemen beat the man with long chrome nightsticks, making a dull thudding sound.
CLOSE ANGLE=>She stands facing the wall. She is crying. The thudding sound of the policemen can be heard in the background.
MED ANGLE=>LUH stops crying, drys her eyes and looks into the mirror. She regains her composure and pores the pills down the toilet. The camera TRACKS with her as she walks into the mainroom. She passes by the Hologram room where the thudding sounds of the policemen are originating.
CLOSE ANGLE=>LUH sits for a moment having now regained control of herself. She takes a cellophane packet of pills out of one of the compartments and carefully removes the pills and replaces them with pills from her pocket. She puts the packet back into the compartment. She becomes aware of the sounds of the policemen in the Hologram room.
FULL ANGLE=>The room contains two over-stuffed reclining chairs, with control panels on the arms. THX is sitting in one of the chairs watching the policemen beat the huddled man. LUH enters and stands by the doorway, slightly repulsed by the beating. THX is aware of her presence, but neither speak.
CLOSE ANGLE=>Upon closer inspection, we see the policemen have smooth chrome faces and are actually robots.
MED ANGLE=>THX reaches for the volume knob and twists it up one notch. Another robot appears beating the man. LUH walks over and sits in the vacant chair. She fidgets nervously.
LUH=>You ought to eat.
LUH=>I started your dinner for you. It's probably ready by now.
THX=>I'm not hungry.
LUH=>Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
LUH=>No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
THX=>What's the matter with you?
NEWSCASTER=>....in the constant striving for perfection in the AIA.PB848's which have been built this year. Five felons have been caught fleeing rehabilitation center dd2. All five have been undergoing treatment for drug offenses, two of the felons were products of the sex act, the other three....
LUH=>What?
NEWSCASTER=>Two of the felons are products of the sex act, the other three are from reproduction clinic nineteen. The quintet escaped from compound 545 and were all subsequently destroyed. Reports indicate....
THX=>What's this? Why did you change it?
LUH=>You've seen enough.
THX=>You know I don't feel well.
LUH=>Eat your dinner.
MANNEQUIN ONE=>....and then my request for new arms and legs finally came through.
MANNEQUIN TWO=>Well that's great then.
MANNEQUIN ONE=>No. It's terrible. I ordered two arms and a new leg, and they sent me two legs and a new arm.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX is expressionless.
THX=>That was very funny.
LUH=>What?
FULL ANGLE=>We now see many rows of TV monitors, surrounded by gages, dials, and switches. Two workers are sitting at the control board facing the monitors. We recognize LUH as one of the workers. A man, SEN 5241, is the other operator.
MED ANGLE=>This is an observation cell, where all phases of life are under continual surveillance. LUH operates the controls at her panel and types what she observes into a computer. On one of the monitors is a man in a bathroom alcove similar to the one we saw in THX's home.
VOICE=>What's wrong?
MAN=>Help me.....HELP me.....
VOICE=>What's wrong?
CLOSE ANGLE=>LUH is tense and pre-occupied. She reacts by pushing a button which programs a new recording.
VOICE=>Take four red capsules, in ten minutes take two more. Help is on the...
MED ANGLE=>LUH has slipped into a daydream. SEN notices the accident and studies LUH for a few moments. Suddenly a voice cackles over the intercom.
INTERCOM VOICE=>Concourse 5.....Cross 3.....Monitor concourse 5.....3417 are you there? Relate....relate.....
CLOSE ANGLE=>LUH reaches for a container of yellow pills, she thinks for a moment, then returns the pills to the container. On the monitors there is much confusion in the destroyed passageway. People move along the corridor to get a better look at the accident. LUH pushes a button and a tape activates.
TAPE VOICE=>Do not enter this area without consuming j23. This is a traumatic area. Do not enter this area without....
INTERCOM VOICE=>Radiation suppress. Seal chamber 5G, seal chamber 5G. Exterminate occupant.
MALE VOICE=>What's wrong?
MAN=>Fire in sub-station 35k, command 13, we've got 73 men down here...
VOICE=>You are a true believer, blessings of State, blessings of the masses Thou art a subject of....
VOICE=>Stay calm, correct procedure is essential. Do not fail to remove auxiliary command circuit before evacuation. Vacuum detail and suppression units for your area have been notified and are on their Way.
VOICE=>My time is yours, go ahead.
VOICE=>Very good, proceed.
THX=>Well.... I slipped on a T5 transfer this morning. It's never happened before. I wasn't concentrating enough. Things haven't been.....
VOICE=>Yes.
THX=>....going well. How could I be so wrong. SCO 1202 cross wired a 904. He's been receiving extra credit. He offered me some. But you must already know about that....Why do I bother you with such.....
VOICE=>Yes
THX=>I did not accept any. I... I wanted... to. But I didn't. You know I didn't. Don't you?
VOICE=>Yes.
THX=>My mate has been acting very strange. I can't explain it.....but. I haven't been feeling very well myself. I don't know, maybe it's me. I needed an SP9 last night. I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
VOICE=>Yes.
THX=>I can't understand. The sedatives....
THX=>....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough. I have a hard time concentrating. Please forgive me, I slipped on....
VOICE=>You are a true believer. Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses. Thou art a subject of the divine. Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill. Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
MED ANGLE=>THX turns around to leave and is confronted by LUH, who has been standing directly behind him. She is holding a punch card.
THX=>What do you want?......
THX=>What did you get?
LUH=>I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.
THX=>When?
LUH=>Now.
THX=>Now?
LUH=>He wants me to come to his quarters.
THX=>A shift change should come through the scheduling office. Why should he want to see you?
LUH=>I don't know.
THX=>Don't go.
LUH=>I have to... he's a G-34
THX=>You don't have to... I don't trust him. You ought to file a report.
LUH=>No, don't make trouble. It's nothing.
THX=>Then why did you bring it up?
LUH=>I didn't. You asked me about the card. You're going to get us into trouble.
THX=>I haven't done anything.
LUH=>Don't be so sure.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX searches for a vacant bench and begins to feel very uncom- fortable. Finally, he turns and leaves.
MAN=>....to stimulate the arithmetical and logical processes as an extention of the 5141. Never before have we been so contented, never before has life been so satisfying...
MAN=>...so satisfying. A referendum of bliss, a fabrication of gratification sustained by the benevolence of authority...
THX=>What?
MAN=>a referendum of bliss, a fabrication of gratification sustained by the benevolence of authority...
THX=>That's not what I meant.
MAN=>...the inadequacies of the human personality are rapidly being over- come by the social processes of advancing technology. Component lowness, a sophisticated stimulation is the answer. The humanity of authority is proudly contemporary. Control through companionship, combined with economic advantages of the mating structure far surpasses any disadvantages in increased perversions. A final...
THX=>LUH?
MAN=>...an infinite translate in mathematics of tolerance and charity among artificial memory devices is ultimately binary. Stimulating...
THX=>LUH? is that you?
THX=>LUH?
WOMAN=>sealed personal effects: 3 styrenes; an occupational syntax; a red magna base - old style; a box of neons; a variation; 23 hunter portapods.
SEN=>Well?
SEN=>It's you, come in, come in...you know, this is really odd. I was just thinking about you. What in the world are you doing here?
SEN=>For the moment, I thought you were one of the others. You look much... different - in person.
SEN=>Sit down, why don't you?.... Anyway... I must apologize for all this chaos. They materialized this morning and it's been going on all day. Well, it's cross I have to bear - the roommate was destroyed, you know.
SEN=>No...I guess you wouldn't. Terrible inconvenience. I could never understand why it all must be created and filed if it's going to be destroyed anyway. When I pass on, I certainly don't want anyone going through my things.... It's a strange life. I really cannot understand why you don't sit down.
SEN=>You never answered my question.
SEN=>Well, at least you're sitting down... You must excuse my going on like that.... with ONA gone I feel as if I have no one to talk to. You're perspiring, aren't you? My goodness, it's not very hot in here. Are you sick?
SEN=>I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though. I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...
THX=>Where is LUH?
SEN=>What?
WOMAN=>Count concluded.
WOMAN=>You must keep this.
SEN=>Yes, of course.
SEN=>They really smell. It's disgusting. Did you notice it?
THX=>Why did you have LUH come here?
SEN=>Why are you so concerned?
THX=>What's going on?
SEN=>I want you for my roommate.
THX=>Where's LUH?
SEN=>It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
THX=>I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH? She was here..
SEN=>We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch. She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself. Would you like something?
THX=>You're in violation.
SEN=>Don't say that. You look... You're not well.
SEN=>I won't have another mate like ONA. You rate very high in sanitation. I've checked. In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH. Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean. We'll be happy.
THX=>I don't feel well.
THX=>....with me? What am I to her or she to me? Nothing. She's an ordinary roommate. I..I share...
VOICE=>Yes...
THX=>...rooms with her. Our relation- ship is normal, conforming. We share nothing but space. What is she doing to...
VOICE=>Yes...
THX=>...to me. I think I'm dying.
VOICE=>You are a true believer. Blessings of the state. Blessings of the masses. Thou art a subject of the divine. Created in the image of man, by man, for man. Let us be thankful we have commerce. Buy more. Buy more now. Buy more and be happy.
MAN=>Idiot machine! Someone ought to fix this machine!
THX=>LUH?
MED ANGLE=>THX enters the kitchen, notices the hexagon, and places it inside the product consumer - small, oven-like appliance that destroys it instantly. He moves slowly, trying to keep from becoming sicker. He opens one of the kitchen cabinets, presses some buttons inside, and sits down at the table. He is shivering uncontrollably and breathing hard.
THX=>I need help.
TV IMAGE=>The bathroom alcove appears empty.
VOICE=>What's wrong?
LUH=>Nothing. I was looking for my tenser. I'm sorry.
VOICE=>If you have a problem....
CLOSE ANGLE=>LUH closes the sedation cabinet and drags the unconscious THX into the bedroom and puts him on the bed.
THX=>Violation...violation...You're bouncing in...violation..
THX=>I've never been under the table before.
LUH=>Look,dirt!
THX=>That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation
LUH=>Looks like dirt
THX=>Look, food!
LUH=>That's not food. Can't be food.
THX=>Looks like food.
THX=>Tastes like food.
THX=>Produced to be consumed!
THX=>Hey! Wait a minute. Not all of it. I'm hungry.
LUH=>The pain, no...the pain, I can't stand it.
THX=>Why?
THX=>Why did you do it? It's wrong.... we're wrong. We're felons now. You know it can't last very long; they will discover us, and they will destroy us.
THX=>Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please. It's just... I was happy. Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
LUH=>What?...Oh, no, THX. That's not true. Not satisfied? THX, I need you so much.
LUH=>I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started. I almost let you go on so many times. It will be worth it, together. When I was alone, I knew.
THX=>But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
THX=>What time is it?
LUH=>What?
THX=>I said what time is it? How long was I out?
LUH=>It's 3+27 hundred
THX=>Three! I'm going to be late for my shift.
LUH=>No! Don't go.
THX=>They'll come for me right away if I'm not there. I have to go.
LUH=>Don't take anything.
THX=>I'll try.
LUH=>Promise...please don't
THX=>What are you doing here? Is anything wrong?
LUH=>No....I though I'm afraid.
THX=>You're not cleared for this precinct. Let's cross over first.
LUH=>You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
THX=>What?
LUH=>On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
THX=>What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
LUH=>But...you...
THX=>I can't work this way. I need something. I'm losing control.
THX=>I can't go on like this. I can't.... I don't just sit around and watch people. If I make a mistake, it's all over. You see it every day. Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
LUH=>I don't want to lose you.
VOICE=>....and it all happened so slowly that most men failed to realize that anything had happened at all.
CLOSE ANGLE=>The voice recites a chant, and the congregation repeats it. THX watches LUH as she repeats the chant. He is moved.
VOICE/CONGREGATION=>Before OMM was OMM, after OMM will be OMM, within OMM is OMM, without OMM is OMM. OMM is one. We are one, Mass is one, All are one....
THX=>I don't want to lose you.
FULL ANGLE=>No one in the cathedral seems to notice.
VOICE=>Unity of minds, unity of thought, unity of occupations, unity of OMM A man. Blessings of the state. Blessings of the masses, Thou art subjects of the divine.
THX=>What are you doing?
LUH=>I don't know.
THX=>What am I going to do?
LUH=>If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me. You'll report me for drug evasion.
THX=>I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift. I'll never make it the way I am now. There have been three explosions already this....
THX=>I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
LUH=>You don't know. You don't....
THX=>If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
LUH=>I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
THX=>Then what? It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
LUH=>We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
LUH=>....My series is over, you only have one shift left, don't you? We could be gone before our next series started.
THX=>It's allright now, shhhh it's all right.
LUH=>Don't let them separate us.
CLOSE ANGLE=>They are like children experimenting for the first time..There is something lyrical and new as they make love. There is a moment of fear for THX as LUH achieves orgasm; something neither has experienced with another person before.
THX=>Are you allright?
LUH=>AH UGH.
LUH=>They know. They've been watching us. I can feel it.
THX=>They don't know.
LUH=>They're watching us now.
THX=>No one can see us now we're alone.
VOICE=>.....This is a reminder of the precision which must be taken at this stage. Three operating cells have already been destroyed in this shift. Mercicontrol is supervising all operations during this phase. Prevent accidents, and be happy.....This is a reminder of.....
THX=>What are you doing here? You're not cleared for this area!
SEN=>You know I have a way with the computers. I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
THX=>I'll report you. It's....
SEN=>Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me. We're going....
THX=>Get out of here, Leave me alone.
SEN=>I've taken care of LUH.....
SEN=>....I've programmed her to level 5450. Her transfer should go through by the next series. You're going to need a new roommate. Everything.....
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX takes a small card from the box and punches holes in the marked areas which read: S,E,N,5,2,4,1. He runs down a list of violations and finally punches: ÒIllegal programming.Ó He puts the card into a slot in the box, and continues to his operating cell.
FULL ANGLE=>In another cell of the operation chamber is a supervisor. He sits in front of a computer readout, TV monitors, and many electronic graphs and gages.
SUPERVISOR=>1138 retract. SB4 talmod contract, retract to 220.
OBSERVER=>We are receiving an extreme respiratory count from a Magnum Manipulator in operating cell 94107. Erratic visual behavior.
CONTROL OFFICER=>Transfer control information.
OBSERVER=>1138 files a violation report on SEN 5241 immediately prior to.....
CONTROL OFFICER=>Violation type?
OBSERVER=>Illegal programming.
CONTROL OFFICER=>Check into it. Current brain wave confirmation on 1138. Adrenal off point 74 or minus 6. No doubt of severe sedation depletion......Inform Magnum supervisor 9410 of procedure to mindlock and arrest. Request MINDLOCK for operating cell 94107; subject 1138 prefix THX.
CONTROL VOICE=>Magnum Manipulator 1138 prefix THX, operating cell 94107, suffering severe drug violation. Extent pending. 1138 subject to immediate arrest. MINDLOCK pending. MINDLOCK pending.
SUPERVISOR=>Priority shift, repeat, priority shift. The situation here is critical. 1138 involved in critical mass maneuver. DELAY
MINDLOCK, DELAY MINDLOCK,=>situation white, repeat, situation white. HOLD...HOLD.....
CLOSE ANGLE=>The supervisor slams s series of relays in disgust, and reports into the computer.
SUPERVISOR=>Who permitted this priority??? This shouldn't happen. Immediate transfer of disaster responsibility to control officer 626, as of time mark: 12/32/581. Repeat; official obligation of responsibility.....
MED ANGLE=>The critical mass component enters the open skull of the chrome man. Sparks fly, and the gages are now in the danger zone. The intercom voice is alive with panicked dialogue.
VOICE=>Clear....Clear....4444,4445, 4446....EJECT...EJECT...EJECT....
VOICE=>Near destruct....Near destruct.
CONTROL OFFICER=>.....MINDLOCK! release MINDLOCK! relapse to command monitor. Release MINDLOCK. Transfer obligation for responsibility to central monitor 898. This center received no evaluation of stasis. Control center 626 holds no responsibility.....
OMM=>Everything is going to be all right. You are in my hands. I will protect you. Everything is going to be all right. Cooperate, stay calm, I am here to help you. Everything is going to be......
CONTROL VOICE=>Relax your controls. Relax your con- trols. Report to Con 5 immediately. Relax your controls.....
CLOSE ANGLE=>Slowly THX begins to tremble and then suddenly stops.
THX=>LUH!
FULL ANGLE=>THX suddenly slams open the escape hatch. The tram is moving at supersonic speeds through a vacuum tube. THX is sucked out into the tube. The open escape hatch seals itself immediately.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX is caught in a loud rush of sound and air as he floats in free fall through the vacuum gravity-free tube. He begins to slow down. As he does, amber lights on the side of the tube become more visible. Suddenly THX is sucked into a smaller tube.
OBSERVER=>1138 prefix THX on warrant. Drug evasion. Fled tram in transit. Surmise destroyed.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX lies unconscious under a pile of scrap waste. He slowly picks himself up, makes his way toward the wall. A low hum is heard and THX drops into the waste as the monitors light up the room.
FULL ANGLE=>When it is dark again, THX follows the wall until he sees a hatchway high up the wall. He jumps for the hatch..but misses it and falls to the floor. He groans, rolls over, revealing a bleeding back. Again there is a low hum and the room lights up.
CLOSE ANGLE=>As the observer makes adjustments on the control panel, he sees something, flips on another monitor for a closer view. He switches over to heat transmission.
FULL ANGLE=>The observer sees a moving hot spot on the screen, marks it, blasts it with a laser beam. A loud screech is heard.
MED ANGLE=>The control observer switches back to light transmission, sees a dead animal the size of a large dog. He continues his scanning. Another room lights up, goes dark.
CLOSE ANGLE=>As THX dislodges a large piece of twisted metal, a trapped animal, like the one killed by the observer, is released and attacks THX. They fight rolling through the debris.
MED ANGLE=>THX strangles the beast. The hum of the monitor is heard as THX tightens his grip on the animals neck. The light goes on. THX freezes, clutching the now quiet beast.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX is exhausted. He can't turn the wheel on the hatch. He climbs down and finds a long bar in the rubble. The TV light goes on. THX freezes. The light goes out and he climbs up the hatch, putting the bar between the spokes of the wheel.
FULL ANGLE=>THX hangs on the bar, rotating the wheel as the hatch slowly opens A muffled buzz is heard as THX climbs out and closes the hatch. The TV light monitor goes on.
OBSERVER=>Seal break. VAC debris receptacle 444. Entrance on con 65. Investigation in process.
FULL ANGLE=>THX rests in the express tube doorway. He is seen on a TV monitor as faint intercom conversations are heard. He waits, trying to get the courage to cross the tube as the auto-jets flash past him.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX takes a breath, sees his chance, races across the roadway. He is on the verge of unconsciousness. An auto-jet can be heard approaching. He barely makes the other side as the jet rushes by. He drops into unconsciousness at the side of the roadway.
OBSERVER=>Maintained visual contact with THX 1138 until 5.34. Lost contact at express tube 929. Surmised destroyed.
CLOSE ANGLE=>She hears something in one of the other rooms, but continues piling up the food.
LUH=>I'm in the kitchen, come and see!
LUH=>THX?
LUH=>THX, Please.....
LUH=>....answer.
THX=>No...no...LUH, help me....help....
THX=>LUH!...Help us..OMM, OMM help us.
THX=>OMM forgive us for our sins. Save us. We are one, mass is one, OMM is one. OMM Help us.....
FULL ANGLE=>The front door opens, and two chrome policemen enter the room.
POLICEMAN=>I am here to help you. Relax. You have nothing to fear. I am here.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX is in a state of extreme terror. Suddenly he flinches, shrinks further into a ball, and peers out into the white void. Slowly he relaxes, then tenses again as he thinks he sees something.
CLOSER ANGLE=>THX has not slept in a great while; which shows in his eyes..He slowly drifts into a light sleep.
FULL ANGLE=>THX wakes with a start as he hears footsteps. Panicked, he looks in all directions trying to discover where the sound is coming from. The footsteps become louder, and louder. THX rises in trembling horror.
OVERHEAD ANGLE=>THX runs around in circles. He stops short as a chrome policeman appears holding a long electronic pole. THX continues to run in circles as two more policemen appear with poles, and surround him. They slowly close in on him, occasionally prodding him with the long poles; which make an electronic sound, causing THX extreme pain.
MED ANGLE=>The policemen close on THX until he is again a huddled, quivering ball. They stand over him, prodding him every few moments, until he begins to weep in desperation.
FULL ANGLE=>Momentarily the prison chamber goes blue, and the policemen return into the white void. THX sits alone, cowering in fear.
OS VOICE=>Increase.
OS VOICE=>No... here... hold this down.
OS VOICE.=>Audio...
2ND VOICE=>Audio is already on.

2ND VOICE=>Permant cortex bond.
1ST VOICE=>Correct.
1ST VOICE=>This really isn't a very good subject because with a cortex bond, we're restricted to about a quarter of the boards potential. .....All this over here is wasted on him. See, we could run a system H.....Watch.
1ST VOICE=>Normally, there would be no visual evidence of a system H. We're not even getting a reading.
1ST VOICE=>HUMMMM.....
2ND VOICE=>What happened?
1ST VOICE=>See if you can get a reading on tactal retention. Try to estimate it without a meter reading.

2ND VOICE=>Vocasity
1ST VOICE=>No, Tetanty.
1ST VOICE=>It's very rare to see a nurl bond dissolve like that.
1ST VOICE=>He's back to normal now.
MED ANGLE=>A mechanical arm tipped with a cotton pad is rubbed in THX's armpit. It retracts, and another arm descends, injecting a needle into his armpit. Simultaneously, blood samples are being obtained from the finger tips, and forearm. The armpit needle has obtained a sample of clear limph fluid, and is retracted into the ceiling.
CLOSE ANGLE=>The arms descend again and fasten two strips of cellophane to THX's biceps. Then a clear plastic tube is inserted into one of his nostrils, and his mouth is sealed shut with a large black plastic clamp. THX's breathing becomes very difficult and he tries to resist, but is powerless. We hear the sound of a pump and a pink fluid is pumped through the tube and into THX.
CLOSER ANGLE=>Tiny clamps are placed around THXÓs eyes and his eyelids are retracted. Two cups on long stems of colored wires are lowered and placed on his eyeballs. There is a slight pause and then the cups begin to vibrate. They stop then vibrate again.
STILL CLOSER ANGLE=>The pump stops, and THX's other nostril is sealed. We hear the pump again, only this time air is sent through the tube. THXÓs chest begins to distend, and keeps distending until it seems his lungs can hold no more.
EXTREMELY CLOSE SHOT=>Two wires are placed deep into THX's chest, and his heart begins to beat very fast. An arm with an extremely sharp stylus starts to scrape a strange pattern on the inside of THX's forearm. Little beads of blood appear where the line was traced. A long flat needle descends and penetrates THX's solar plexus. When fully in, it rotates in eccentric circles for a few moments, and then retracts, leaving only a small drop of blood where it has been.
CLOSE SHOT=>Another arm with a razor-sharp scalpel moves to THX's forearm and delicately incises an almond shaped pattern on the skin. His heart, which has been beating rapidly, suddenly slows to almost nothing.
MED ANGLE=>The entire process has been continually typed into a computer. At this point, a read out activates; which reads: 1138thx Diognosis-compatable. Rate: Excellent. Exceptions: Left kidney.
THX=>Are you...are you real? LUH?...LUH?
THX=>Are you all right?
THX=>What did they do to you?
LUH=>I'm going to have a child.
THX=>no...no, no.
LUH=>Oh, THX... hold me, hold me,
THX=>It's the end.
LUH=>I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX=>It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
THX=>I didn't want this. How did it happen? Don't leave me... stay here with me.
LUH=>You have to be strong. You're going to have a son.
EXTREME LONG SHOT=>They lie huddled together in the vastness of the white limbo.
LONG SHOT=>They kiss
MED ANGLE=>They become passionate and begin to take off each others clothes.
CLOSE ANGLE=>They begin to make love.
CLOSER ANGLE=>They make love.

DEFENSE=>Reject, reject. Inefficient unwarranted destruction. Must be saved...mass is one... can be productive. Name of economics; cure this soul...malignant cure. There is a heritage of good and economic efficiency.... net gain.
PONTIFEX=>Granted.
DEFENSE=>Inane...inane...
PONTIFEX=>Rejected.
DEFENSE=>Reject...reject...reject... What is the prosecution doing? This is not a race issue....not here. Remember sanctity of the individual regardless of race. A nonresponsible act...simple case. Birthborn citizens are physically compatible with clinic types and must be consumed, not destroyed. Econ equilibrium status 542 through 691 apply to case. Defendant used, not destroyed. Case rest.
PONTIFEX=>Conclude.
PROCTOR=>Concluded.
PONTIFEX=>Proceed.
PONTIFEX=>OMM be praised. All are One. Praise be to the masses.
PROCTOR=>1138 prefix THX stands convicted of index 3278.927 appendix 445 through 613. Drug evasion 321, 399, and malicious sexual perversion.
PROCTOR=>...1138-THX is pronounced invaluable. The subject shall be consumed as economics dictate.
POLICEMAN=>THX 1138.
PTO=>It's all right...you're safe now.
PTO=>Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away? Economically, it's not sound at all. Very much unlike....
NIN=>I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
DWY=>They're mad...mad...
PTO=>It is incalculably more destructive for you to believe you are about to be destroyed then if you actually were destroyed. We've got many residents on the verge of hysteria! It's got to stop....your unpleasant....
DWY=>We're just waiting to die!
NIN=>Calm down! Nothing can be accomplished in an...
PTO=>You always manage to avoid the issue: What's wrong with our present condition? We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble? You should examine your emotions. It is senseless...
NIN=>What are you talking about? When did you sleep last? Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind. You've been here so long you can't see what is happening. We must unite. We need unity. We need action. We have come to a time when we must....
JOT=>Please...
VOICE=>Hi, buddy.
JOT=>Look, will you please get off. You're standing on my work.
VOICE=>Hi, buddy.
JOT=>Hello....
VOICE=>......buddy?
JOT=>Buddy.
NCH=>I want to learn about what you're doing, huh? Tell me something nice about what you're doing.
JOT=>.....doing?
NCH=>Yeah, what you're doing, you know. The thing about you perverts is, you're always running around doing things. I want to hear something really nice.
JOT=>I'm doing....working....a space... viable....
NCH=>Naa...that's not nice. You know that's not nice.
NCH=>Tell me something nice.
JOT=>......doing......
NCH=>Pervert!
NCH=>Damn insidious malicious pervert!
JOT=>Help!
NCH=>Pervert. Pervert. Pervert.
NCH=>Pervert! Pervert! Pervert!
POLICEMAN=>CAM 5424.
SEN=>You're real! Where did you come from?
SEN=>I know you turned me in.
SEN=>I'm doing quite well here anyway. What's wrong with you?...Don't be like that. You're a stupid man!
CAM=>.....without pity!
PTO=>But.....
CAM=>Without pity!
TWA=>Too fast! If only I could see a fixed point.
PTO=>Umm.....
PTO=>....my friend? Your point of view....
PTO=>Yes, CAM. That's it....Your point is well taken...CAM, but it lacks the balance that a broader and a deeper range of experience can lend it. When I first arrived here, I saw things as you do now. I was confused and anxious about my predicament. I longed to thrash out, to tear down, to destroy and annihilate; to ravage, wreak havoc, and plunder. Being basically level-headed, however, I realized that my first goal should be to study this place, where what seemed blind circumstance had placed me. To follow the train of events and the ever-changing display of characters that I saw before me - of which I am of course a part - and to try to discern a pattern within the confusion.
NIN=>Mumblings is right!
NIN=>Sooner or later, you'll be taken away and destroyed just like the others.
PTO=>In the years to come you will be grateful for what may now seem like senseless sacrifices. With a passion such as yours, I don't think it would be foolish to say that you might see further and deeper than any of us, right to the heart of Truth herself!
DWY=>You're frightened. You're frightened that at any moment you'll be taken away. I know, I've felt that way. I couldn't eat. I still have trouble. It goes right through, all the time. I know all right, but I'm better now. I can more or less regulate it. I don't think you can understand. .....Terrible, terrible, terrible.... I've been thinking about you.
POLICEMAN=>OUE 6662.
DWY=>I should have known...You're with them. You want....
CAM=>Then SLE and RNH, who came between PRT and MNH, but not before ALF, FRG, and MLK. ALF, FRG, and MLK went before SAM, RNG, NUR, and KLM. Then RRG, STK, OUN, and FLT. And after them came....came....
PTO=>Four quick felons prepare the bed modules to be cleaned.
CAM=>Huh?
PTO=>Four quick felons prepare the bed modules to be cleaned. Four: F; Quick: Q; Felons: F.....
CAM=>Four....quick....felons prepare. FRK, QUM, FLN, PSK, and TEL; BGL, MLT, TRN, BRK, and CLS.
PTO=>Yes, fine! You see, history is not only important, it can be fun as well.
NIN=>I can't believe it! MRK CRK TRK SRK BRK..... What do you think happened to MRK and CRK and TRK? Where are they now? I'll tell you where....no where.
PTO=>Of course it is true that no one has ever returned once they were taken away, history tells us that, but it is idle to speculate about the reasons why and absurd to torture oneself over an idle speculation as NIN is doing. NIN has in fact destroyed himself many times over with worry. LOO 3122, who has taken away not long before you arrived, believed that he was going to a wonderful place where he would be happy, and in so believing he created a veritable paradise for himself right here. Unfortunately, not all of us can have the positive conviction of LOO, but thankfully not all of us are burdened with the ominous forebodings of NIN. I myself have found that concentrating...
NIN=>That's what I mean by the wrong idea.
PTO=>I am not going to try to prove the usefulness of history, it is genuinely too obvious to need proof. We see before us innumerable scenes, like what we just witnessed, that succeed each other in endless repetition. Where we see the same faults followed regularly by the same misfortunes, we may reasonably....
NIN=>You're wrong! They're going to destroy him!
NIN=>I can just barely see him. I think he's leaving.
TWA=>Impossible!
PTO=>I don't see anything.
PTO=>I can't see him at all. He's been destroyed.
TWA=>No, look! Three degrees from the central azimuth.
NIN=>He's free! Can't you see: he's free!
CAM=>I can see him. He's coming back.
PTO=>Where? Oh...there he is. He must have been stopped. Don't you think?
DWY=>He was stopped. He was stopped. Now what are we going to do?
NIN=>He's coming back for the rest of us. He can't make it alone.
TWA=>I wonder how far he went. He's gathered invaluable information out there.
PTO=>The reckless fool. I'm not responsible.
NIN=>What happened?
DWY=>What stopped you?
TWA=>How far did you go? Was it cold?
PTO=>You have nothing to fear. You're safe again.
NIN=>Wait! I'll talk to him.
TWA=>Ask him about the air. He looks out of breath.
NIN=>Can you speak? Can you hear me?
DWY=>I think he's deficient.
NIN=>I don't think so. Why don't you go find something else to do?
DWY=>Then why doesn't he speak? Can't he hear? I don't think he knows.
CAM=>He took my food. He stole it.
TWA=>Now, now.
SEN=>I thought you were through with it!
NIN=>We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed. You can work with us. An organized plan of escape must be devised first. Could you see anything? You want to leave. You're not like them. You must have left something, or someone.
NIN=>Without most of us realizing it, a "new alignment" has been formed... and it is an exciting, healthy development.. this alignment is already a new majority; it will effect the future of us all for generations to come. We need a new unity, but not a unity which discourages dissent. We Need dissent.
PTO=>What?
POLICEMAN=>A nondescript: 364-1399284
SEN=>What is it?
NIN=>Good Lord!
PTO=>A shelldweller. They live in the outer shell of the city. Quite unique, there have been two here before. They smell.
TWA=>Interesting....
DWY=>Get....get away, get, get, get, get away....
CAM=>Leave it....for a while.
TWA=>There!
CAM=>No, nothing.
TWA=>There!
CAM=>Nothing.
NIN=>I think that a leader must, whenever he possibly can, make the decision for more knowledge rather than less, but he must also have the wisdom to limit freedom so as to insure freedom. That is what will keep us strong and give us direction.
PTO=>Well?
TWA=>Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
PTO=>Not very encouraging.
TWA=>On the contrary! It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits. We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth. We must continue the search.
NIN=>I have always tended to believe that this kind of knowledge is all well and good in its place, but anything can be taken too far, and when you've got every- one looking off into telescopes and not tending to business right here, then, I believe, we have gone too far.
TWA=>The sighting of a fixed point beyond our confines is fundamental to all other problems and issues. It would instantly determine whether we are, whether this world is, in fact, moving or standing still.
NIN=>I have been thinking seriously recently about the role we are expected to play as individuals and as a unit within the broader outlines of society.
TWA=>Aha!
PTO=>......because of the great pressure and bad air, they never attain a height greater than four feet although some of them are ferocious fighters and show great courage and skill. Whether they are descendants of those who lost them- selves in the superstructure, or whether they are actually a separate race, no one can tell. They depend on their strange appearance and peculiar smell to fend off any intruders, and they make the city shell a most unpleasant place in which to be lost. The authorities tolerate a moderate amount of them at any one time, but they must be kept under control with occasional sweep campaigns, which is probably where this one came from.
CAM=>Because of the great pressure and bad air, they never attain...
TWA=>I've got it! Astounding!
PTO=>What?
TWA=>No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry. This world is in a state of static-mobility: we are at the same time moving and standing still.
NIN=>That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
TWA=>It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
NIN=>There goes another of your disciples.
PTO=>It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
PTO=>Our life is brief and powerless. On all of us, the slow, sure doom falls pitiless and dark. Blind to good and evil, reckless of destruction, omnipotent authority rolls on its relentless way. Condemned today to lose our friends, tomorrow ourselves to pass through the gate of darkness, it remains only for us to cherish, before the blow falls, the lofty thoughts that ennoble this little day; disdaining the coward terrors of the slave of fate, to worship at the shrine that our own hands have built; undismayed by the empire of chance, to preserve a mind free from the wanton tyranny that rules our outward life; proudly defiant of the irresistible forces that tolerate, for a moment, out knowledge and our condemnation, to sustain alone, weary but unyielding, the world that our own ideals have fashioned despite the trampling march of unconscious power.
SEN=>What is the Freak doing? He chews, but he doesn't seem to eat. The longer it stays, the greater the mess. Nobody lifts a finger. Isn't anybody going to get rid of the damn thing? All of its leavings are piling up.
POLICEMAN=>LUH 9998
THX=>LUH! .......
SEN=>What happened to her? Do you know where she is? Why isn't she here... What are you thinking?
THX=>I'm leaving.
SEN=>What?
THX=>I'm leaving.
SEN=>When?.....How?
THX=>Right now.
SEN=>But you can't...you.
SEN=>Wait, I'm coming too.
NIN=>What's going on....what are you doing?
SEN=>We're leaving.
NIN=>What?
SEN=>We're leaving.
NIN=>Who? Who's leaving?
SEN=>THX and me.
NIN=>But you can't. We must escape. The new alignment. The plan. The organization.
NIN=>Wait....sit down, let's talk about it. You can't just do this on your own. We must present a united front...gather more pertinent information... plans have to be made.
NIN=>Think of the new alignment. What are you doing? You can't do this!
NIN=>We must escape. We have plans. We can leave. We must wait until...
TWA=>Incredible!
EXTREME LONG SHOT=>THX walks briskly through the white. SEN follows a short distance behind, occasionally dropping a cube of food.
LONG SHOT=>THX and SEN are sitting, resting in the vast void. SEN is eating. THX is thinking.
MED SHOT=>They are walking. SEN seems to be having a difficult time.
SEN=>The air is getting thinner. Or the pressure is getting greater. It's the pressure. How do you feel?
SEN=>It's the air. It's closing in. I can't stand it any longer. There's no room. No air.
THX=>I haven't got time. You can stay here if you like.
SEN=>No!
SEN=>It shouldn't be this far.
SEN=>What?
THX=>Look!
SEN=>Oh No!
THX=>It doesn't seem to be moving.
SEN=>Look, he's waving...It's a man. He's waving.
SRT=>Hello...hello. Where did you come from?
SRT=>Well, it doesn't make any difference, I guess.
SRT=>What's that? Food? Good, I'm starving. Do you mind?
THX=>What are you doing here?
SRT=>I was lost.
THX=>...and you're not lost now?
SRT=>No, I...
SEN=>You know the way out?!
SRT=>Um hmm...
THX=>Which way?
SRT=>That way.
SEN=>That's where we were.
SRT=>Maybe you were traveling in circles. That's the way out.
THX=>How do you know?
SRT=>Look more closely.
SEN=>Wait, help.
SEN=>There was nothing there.
SRT=>It could lead anywhere...
SEN=>No...Let's not...
THX=>Let's head for that door.
THX=>We've lost SEN!
SRT=>What?
THX=>Lost SEN! He'll never find us.
SRT=>Too late....stay close.
SRT=>...it doesn't matter. The rest of it just didn't happen.
THX=>What are you talking about. How do you know? I need her! I need her. She needs me. I've got to get to her.
SRT=>Maternity ward, huhh!
THX=>We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN. I'm crazy! This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing? My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore. Who are you?
SRT=>Who? Me?...I don't know.
THX=>What kind of answer is that?
SRT=>I don't know.
SRT=>Oh, That! I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
THX=>I don't care.. SRT gets up and looks around the embryo room. He takes one of the jars and removes it from the shelf.
THX=>It's all her fault!...She put orinase in my sedation.
THX=>How can I love her?
SRT=>Look!
THX=>No!
VOICE=>You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure. Check cybernetic manual F-45. If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation. This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are. Authorities will arrive shortly.
THX=>You should know better than that!
SEN=>They took everything...and then they were going to take my food.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX stops to catch his breath. SRT disappears around a corner. THX runs to catch up, but when he reaches the corner, he discovers SRT has disappeared. He goes alone.
VOICE=>.....and two inmates have fled detention block R, habot 92. They have been missing for approximately 3:32.16 hours.
ELC=>We have a U65 on a K8. Transfer all unauthorized contacts in precient 688 CON-G to this center. Mode 7.
ELC=>Request two PB848's: officers 1999 and 2187. Proceed with recovery operation of felons 1138thx and 5241sen. Current position reproduction center 35, precient 688, CON-G. Report when felons are in custody, revised position: HOLD.... Felons have entered maintance area of reproduction control computer 35-B4. Transfer.
VOICE=>This is not the place for prayer.
SEN=>Yes....
VOICE=>What?....Are you in any trouble?
SEN=>No...No...I'm all right. I'm going now.
MONK=>Are you SAG?....What is your number and prefix? I'm going to have to put this in your record.
SEN=>No...I'll just leave.
MONK=>I'm sorry, I have to report all intruders.....Where is your identification badge?
SEN=>I lost it.
MONK=>You're in violation. I'm going to notify the authorities. This is beyond my jurisdiction.
SEN=>No! Give....Give me time.
SEN=>OMM...OMM What have I done?
MED ANGLE=>THX runs down a corridor away from the policeman. Exhausted and trapped, he discovers an opening between two electronic panels, and squeezes into the cramped hiding place.
FULL SHOT=>The robots stop a short distance from where THX is hiding. Another policeman joins him.
POLICEMAN=>We need assistance. Electroscan impossible. Must rely on visual sighting. Request three additional officers.
ELC=>Assistance priority request filed. Continue with operation.
MED ANGLE=>THX runs through the electronic hallways. He stops at an exit; a hole high in the ceiling with a ladder in it. Suddenly he hears someone coming. He jumps for the ladder and misses, landing on a heap on the floor.
CLOSE ANGLE=>He is about to make another leap when someone grabs him from the rear. THX faints and collapses on the floor.
ELC=>....and both felons were located in reproduction center 34. Apprehension pending. Priority shift for 3 additional officers delayed. Subjects will be returned to.....
VOICE=>Priority shift granted. Officers 5254, 9696 and 1970 dispatched to Con G.
ELC=>It's about time . Three additional officers enroute to assist in operation. Advise at time of apprehension.
ANNOUNCER=>Termination of exurban link-DD NECK 08. This tram will return to central web in five minutes.
FULL SHOT=>Outside, the tram station is deserted and only partially completed. There are corridors leading from the station, but these too, are unfinished. The station is lit only by dim work lights. The sound of running water is heard.
CLOSE SHOT=>SEN very timidly begins to explore one of the corridors. The walls are solid, uneven rock, covered with plastic sheeting. Many tubes and wires are lying on the floor, leading off into the distance. Occasionally there is a strange-looking tool dropped against the wall.
MED SHOT=>SEN comes to a section of rock that is steaming. There is a strong draft blowing past him toward the tram station. As he rounds a corner a strange volcanic sound comes from the depths of the unfinished corridor. Suddenly a large rat scampers past him and into the uncompleted shaft.
CLOSE SHOT=>SEN is terrified and at the same time intrigued by what he is seeing. He stops and listens. He hears the sound of the trams pressure valves closing up.
FULL SHOT=>He looks back, he cannot see the tram and he is instantly overcome with fear. He runs madly around the corner and down the corridor. The tram is till there. He reaches the tram just as the door begins to close.
OBSERVER=>I have an unusual report - a nonaccidental death. Are there any felons reported in section 692 CON F?
ELC=>No, the closest thing I have is in CON G, they couldn't have done it. Relay to analysis.
ELC=>...Let me recheck .... ... Backlog on case 6178821150.
ELC=>I have an unexplained discrepancy. A description of one of the felons trapped in reproduction center 35 doesn't match his Harris profile. Transfer any unauthorized contact for a radius of 30 sections. Relay.
SRT=>I'm sorry...I didn't mean to frighten you.
THX=>How did you get me up here?...
SRT=>What was that....
THX=>Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
SRT=>What have you done, Cut your hand?
THX=>I'm all right
CHILD=>My inducer fell off.
SEN=>What...?
CHILD=>3114 knocked it off.
SEN=>Oh?....
CHILD=>He didn't mean to.
CHILD=>Look out!
CHILD=>What's the matter with you?
SEN=>I'm sorry...let me see it again.
CHILD=>What are you doing here? Where's your badge?
SEN=>I'm an escaped felon.
FIRST CHILD=>You are not! Why aren't you arrested?
SEN=>I'm waiting to be picked up. Here, hold this...
SEN=>There!
SECOND CHILD=>What's your name?
SEN=>SEN 5241
SECOND CHILD=>I'm 3114 and he's 1112
SEN=>Hello.... How is that? Any good....
FIRST CHILD=>O K
SEN=>When I was in school it was all different. We had to lie in bed all the time. ADVANCED PRIMARY ECONOMICS was a bottle about this big.... It took a week.
CHILDREN=>Wow!
MED ANGLE=>THX sits quietly on one of the empty slabs. SRT wanders through the dead bodies, occasionally lifting the covers and looking underneath. THX takes a cube of food out of his shirt. He considers the possibility of not offering any to SRT.
THX=>Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
SRT=>All the insides are gone!
SRT=>Did you know all the insides are gone from these people?
CLOSE ANGLE=>On one of the slabs is a body with a particulary large head.
SRT=>This one must have been a genius!
SRT=>...Yes, definitely smarter then the rest.
SRT=>This one has eyes. Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
THX=>No!....
THX=>I knew him.
SRT=>Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
THX=>Shut up.
SRT=>Your a fool.....If you continue after LUH, you'll end up here. Forget her. You can't go back.
MED ANGLE=>The figure begins to staple plastic tags on the ears of the bodies, checking a list as he goes. As he works, two more figures enter with a cart and lift the tagged bodies into it.
ELC=>We've lost contact with 1138. An unidentified felon is traveling with him. Will transfer further information when available.
OBSERVER=>Visual contact with 5241SEN. ....Habot 25 CON-H, PS947.
ELC=>Request PB848: officer 1088 proceed with recovery of felon 5241SEN. Current position Habot 25, CON-H, PS947.
OBSERVER=>Negative sweep of CON-J, section H.
ELC=>Try closer to the reproduction center.
2ND CHILD=>No...impresses on each of us.
1ST CHILD=>That's not how it goes.
2ND CHILD=>Yes it is....
SEN=>Go on.
1ST CHILD=>.....There are no other rational alternatives in this way. We eliminate the economic function generated by the contrast of separate but compatible energies.
2ND CHILD=>Elements! Compatible elements.
1ST CHILD=>Energies.
CLOSE ANGLE=>The policeman tapes SEN's hands behind his back. SEN looks at the first child....
SEN=>You're right.
1ST CHILD=>See!
2ND CHILD=>He doesn't know.
CLOSE ANGLE=>The figure with the staple gun approaches the slab on which SRT is lying.
FULL ANGLE=>The figure staples a tag on THX's ear. His body jerks with pain, the figure jumps back with a yelp.
FIGURE WITH CART=>What's wrong?
MED ANGLE=>THX and SRT run furiously down a long hallway; there are two doors at the end, one of which is locked.
CLOSE ANGLE=>Four or five men enter from the end of the hallway, THX tries the second door, which opens and they rush inside, closing and locking the door behind them.
THX=>We're trapped.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX is fumbling desperately at the controls of the master board.
FULL SHOT=>SRT is feeling along the walls for a removable panel.
SRT=>That's a waste of time.
THX=>That's not it.
SRT=>No?
THX=>There!......There!
SRT=>Come here and help me, we have no time.....
SRT=>The only way out seems to be the way we came in.
OMM=>This is OMM. Everything is fine. You are in my hands. I will protect you. Co-operate with Mercicontrol. They only want to help you. Everything is going to be all right.
THX=>She's not there
SRT=>No...... She's dead THX........
THX=>You don't know that!
SRT=>All right...
SRT=>Get up for a second....
SRT=>There...
SRT=>Remember this...?
THX=>Where's LUH?
SRT=>Look more closely.
SRT=>That's all that's left of her besides something like what's in the next room.
THX=>No...no you're wrong.
SRT=>I'm only trying to help you.
THX=>You're wrong.
SRT=>I'm sorry.
THX=>What do you want?
SRT=>Save yourself....
SRT=>...life seems very natural, once you have been born, but, for the unborn it is a frightening mystery. It is not easy to choose life if you have never lived.
VOICE=>Observation booth 649, Division of plastic, CON H
ELC=>Request 2 PB848's: Officers 4242 and....
OBSERVER=>No visual contact in OB 649.
ELC=>That's allright. They're not going anywhere.
VOICE=>Heart 6G, lungs 35OR, liver defective, kidney-right-641A...
SRT=>Just look at all those people.
THX=>I thought of something.....
POLICEMAN VOICE=>Gentlemen, you have nothing to fear, everything will be all right....
FULL ANGLE=>We see two policemen outside the observation cell talking into a small intercom on the door. A group of about five or six people are gathering at the end of the hallway to observe the scene.
POLICEMAN=>Stay calm, the door seems to be jammed or locked; please check the lock on your side. We are not going to hurt you. Everything will be all right.
POLICEMAN=>Stay calm........
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX madly typing into the computer, he speaks into an intercom....
THX=>repeat..fire in observation 649 ..... all systems....
THX=>Get ready...
VOICE=>Discontinue all operations....
VOICE=>Repeat..discontinue all operations. Correct procedure is essential... Stay clam..evacuate this complex...
ELC=>Report!
POLICEMAN'S VOICE=>Felons now fleeing section..
ELC=>Hold.... mindlock Precinct 331 CON H general area... MINDLOCK.....
FULL SHOT=>One of the policemen is helping the other to his feet and reporting to ELC ....
POLICEMAN=>Mindlock stabilized, felons unaffected. Pursuit instructions. We have been informed to discontinue operations, is this correct..confirm..
ELC=>Continue pursuit, disregard previous instructions, proceed.
ELC=>Mindlock impossible. Subjects suffering...total chemical imbalance. Mindlock completely disrupted. Request destruction clearance. Stand by.
ELC=>Proceed to dispersal center 21. Projected route of flight will be transferred.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX and SRT thread through the crowded dispersing center as the policemen struggle to locate them. The felons are swept toward the tram system. SRT signals to THX.
SRT=>This way!
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX and SRT become separated in the pushing crowd. Individually, they reach a row of the massive jet-powered vehicles. A policeman begins to move toward the autojet area.
FULL ANGLE=>THX gets into an Autojet. SRT is at the other end of the parking area and a policeman is between him and THX. SRT climbs into an autojet, careful not to be noticed by the policeman.
MED ANGLE=>THX starts his car with an ear-deafing roar. He turns the car out of its parking space and begins to coast out of the center, past SRT's car.
CLOSE ANGLE=>SRT is having difficulty starting his car. On the dashboard, a red light flashes: ENGAGED. He is slightly comic as he tries to deal with the incredible array of switches and buttons.
FULL ANGLE=>The policeman is approaching as SRT continues his struggle to start the car. Suddenly, the powerful jets star and the car uncontrollably lurches forward at great speed, crashing head-on into a wall. The car begins to smoke.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX has been watching in his rear view mirror. He put on his breaks and turns to look back.
FULL ANGLE=>SRT cannot be seen in the smoking car. The car lights go on and then off. The car explodes into a ball of flames.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX buries his head in his hands.
MED ANGLE=>Over his headset, THX listens for police reports. The messages on the channel are routine. THX must constantly fight to maintain control of his car. He can see the two policemen following on his radar scope.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX hears a strange noise coming from his car. He tries to find the source of the sound, and momentarily loses control of the car.
FULL ANGLE=>The car swerves and scrapes the wall of the tunnel.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX sees the policemen gaining on his radar scope and pushes his car even faster, making it even more difficult to control. The policemen momentarily drop back. The loud noise in his car begins to get worse, and he checks his gauges. The policemen slowly begin to gain on THX.
FULL ANGLE=>The car bobbles as THX has more and more difficulty keeping it under control. A part flies off, causing one of the jet- bikes to swerve. The policeman lose control of his bike, tumbles across the roadway and bounces off the wall, parts flying in all directions.
CLOSE ANGLE=>As THX's speed increases, the engine heats up, moving the indicator into the danger zone. THX looks for a switch to cool the engine. He is now experiencing serious mechanical trouble. One of the engines is making a very loud screeching sound. Finally THX flips the right switch, and the temperature needle moves out of the danger zone.
FULL ANGLE=>Tension builds as the jet car and the jet bikes race at incredible speeds through the maze of tunnels. As the car passes level markers, we realize THX is rising up through the city. Finally he reaches level 10.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX picks up a new object on his radar scope coming from the opposite direction, heading directly toward him. Suddenly a control voice breaks in over radio head set.
VOICE=>Stop your vehicle. Officers are approaching from both directions. Stop your vehicle. You have nothing to fear.
OMM=>Everything will be all right, you are in my hands. You have nowhere to go. I am here to protect you. You have nowhere to go. You have nowhere....
FULL ANGLE=>THX rounds a corner and sees a faint light ahead of him. His autojet continues to blast along the tunnel roadway.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX begins to panic as he watches the dots ahead of him and behind him close on the scope.
ELC=>I don't understand. He's not stopping. Is scope 621 giving an accurate reading?....fine. Just checking. Officer 3333, Abort....Abort....Abort...
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX is shaken, but no hurt.
FULL ANGLE=>The jet bike which was following THX hits the wreckage of the first bike and tumbles end over end through the tunnel.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX gets out of the car and runs down the roadway. Lights appear in the distance. THX presses against the wall as an autojet rockets past him. He begins to run again as a crash is heard in the distance.
FULL ANGLE=>Two policemen pass the wreckage on their jet bikes. THX finds a door on the side of the tunnel and enters.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX is becoming weary as the policeman methodically searches for him using a thermoviewer heat detector. THX stops to rest for a moment. He is cold, shaking. He hears something.
FULL ANGLE=>Out of no where, something jumps on THX's back and knocks him to the pavement. It is a long-haired dwarf freak, similar to the one in the prison chamber.
MED ANGLE=>They fight violently and THX eventually gets the freak by the neck and begins beating his head on the concrete until it is dead. THX is exhausted, and lies on the pavement trying to catch his breath.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX is lying next to the carcass of the freak. He hears a sound and looks up to see more freaks approaching, staring at him through the darkness with firey eyes. THX scrambles to his feet and runs as fast as he can. The freaks attack the carcass he has killed.
FULL ANGLE=>The policeman is joined by another and they methodically search through the superstructure. THX runs until he reaches a metal ladder which works its way up into the city shell. He begins to climb, each footstep echoing as his foot hits the metal rungs.
CLOSE ANGLE=>The policemen hear THX and immediately get a fix on him. They head for the ladder. THX reaches the top of the ladder and is stopped by a large metal hatchway. He struggles to get it open.
FULL ANGLE=>The policemen begin to climb the ladder, their feet resounding throughout the superstructure.
ELC=>Officers 9641 and 2242 discontinue operation. Report to Thermal station 62. Present operation computed to be economically unfeasible. It is predicted that 1138 THX will self- destroy. Repeat: Abandon present operation. Dispatch to Level 56 CON-R thermal station 62, investigate toxic chemical leak.
CLOSE ANGLE=>THX goes through the open hatch and continues on until he reaches a small chamber with a circular door, slightly ajar. An unnaturally bright light floods through the crack in the door.
MED ANGLE=>THX is obviously afraid of what lies beyond the door. There is a moment when it looks as if he may turn back. Eventually, he makes a decision and throws the hatch open.
FULL ANGLE=>He stands bewildered, virtually buried in sunlight. THX climbs out of the hatchway and stands shielding his eyes from the sun.
