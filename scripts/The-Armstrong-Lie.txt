[ARCHIVE FOOTAGE}=>REPORTER: Oh my, oh no. no! It's Armstrong who's losing his temper. LANCE ARMSTRONG: I was content with my career. I mean, at '93, '94, '95, I was a young kid, one of the best one-day racers in the world, made plenty of money. I thought--this is cool. I'm young. I’m, um, I'm making some decent money here and I'll just do this for a few years then find something else to do. Then the disease came along, took all of that away. Just--gone. And when I came back I thought, you know, nobody thinks I’m going to do anything, I’m just, I’m just washed up, damaged goods here, which is, is really the, what the view of the sport was. I thought, okay, fuck it. I’m going to try to win the Tour de France. SPORTS CASTER #1: He's got the fastest time at half distance SPORTS CASTER #2: Well he really is flying, Paul. He looks so good here making his big return to the Tour de France SPORTS CASTER #1: Well he's been scorching it all the time checks. What a come back this could be. There's only two men behind him now. Armstrong is the leader! That is astonishing. TEAMMATE: Beautiful. JOHAN BRUYNEEL: Wonderful! [LAUGHS] TEAMMATE: Fantastic! [TDF Home Movies] UNKNOWN: Hold on a second. Oh here we go. Say hi to the camera. This is Johan Bruyneel, Director Sportive. JOHAN BRUYNEEL: Hi camera. UNKNOWN: Here we are with the rockstar, George Hincapie. GEORGE HINCAPIE: Entre....Yo that thing’s cool! UNKNOWN: What's up, Lance? NARRATOR: After his bout with cancer, Lance returned to the Tour in 1999, racing for the US postal service.

[ARCHIVE FOOTAGE]=>[English subtitles] They enter a cafe, shoving everyone aside and take anything: red wine, champagne, beer. Even water, if there's nothing better. PHIL LIGGETT: And then, of course, the clever doctors have come on board, saying to athletes, "We can prepare you properly for the Tour. Not just give you dope, but we'll tell you the correct diet, how to train, and, then, coup de gras is to give you the, the needle of EPO and you're going to be ten percent better than your rival. That is enormous and that became apparent in the 1990's. Firstly, with the Italians.

[ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE]=>COMMENTATOR: What happened was that Filippo Simeoni tried to attack to join the six-man breakaway that had built up a bit of a lead on the Peloton. The trouble is that Lance doesn't like Simeoni, who is actually suing him for slander in Italy after Armstrong called him a liar. ALEX GIBNEY: Was that all about Ferrari? GEORGE HINCAPIE: [laughs] FRANKIE ANDREU: Simeoni had testified at a trial against Ferrari, and Lance was working with Michele Ferrari and considered Ferrari a good friend, so in the race Simeoni attacked, and Lance, who had the yellow

[RACE FOOTAGE]=>COMMENTATOR: The result was that Simeoni returned to the field having apparently been told by Lance to sit at the back and shut up. That's the kind of authority the patron of the Peloton has, and Lance is not afraid to wield it.
{ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE INTERVIEWING LANCE}=>REPORTER: Lance, can I ask just, what when on between you and Simeoni today in the race? LANCE ARMSTRONG: I was just following the wheels. FRANKIE ANDREU: He can be revengeful and vindictive, but then at the same time very, very loyal and supportive, and I've been on both sides.
[FRANKIE INTERVIEWING LANCE}=>FRANKIE: What do you expect at the finish for yourself? LANCE: Honestly, I, I don’t, I, I don't know. Um, you know, if, if, if Cancellara is dropped, and the climb isn't as hard as we all think and, and, uh, and I stay with the leaders, then I can take the jersey. FRANKIE: And what would that mean to you? LANCE: It'd be great. It'd be a trip. I mean....

[LANCE CYCLING]=>LANCE ARMSTRONG: Gibney, we gotta win this fucking Tour de France. ALEX GIBNEY: Yeah, it’s gotta, I- I'm counting on you for the movie. I know this is not a – this is all about me. LANCE ARMSTRONG: Trust me, this will not be the same if I don't. It'll be hard--harder than I thought. Harder than I thought a week ago. [B-Roll BIKERS AROUND TURN] NARRATOR: Lance had lost ground, but he was still close to the lead and only 2 seconds behind his rival Contador going into the biggest climb of the Tour. I figured if Lance was gonna manage his mythic comeback, he would have to beat Contador here. But would that be enough to put an end to all the questions about the past? BRUYNEEL: Today is a very important day. We have two weeks of racing behind us. We have one very hard week ahead of us, and today could be a day where a lot of things change. You know, everybody is always talking about Alberto, Lance--Lance, Alberto. We are here to win the Tour de France. Of course, both of them are feeling good, and both of them want to try to win.

[POV BIKING SHOT]=>NARRATOR: I don't think Lance's apology was just banter. Part of it was real--saying he was sorry he couldn't deliver one more time--the perfect fairy tale that everyone had come to expect. NARRATOR: Going forward, he was looking for a way to salvage things. What meaning would his comeback have if he couldn’t finish in the top three. Now in second, he braced for attacks from Garmin's Bradley Wiggins and the Schleck Brothers. All determined to push him off the podium. [B-Roll BRUYNEEL IN CAR HANDING OUT WATER AND ENERGY BARS]
[POV EATING ENERGY BAR]=>NARRATOR: Johan knew that Lance was not at his best. So he pursued a delicate strategy--protecting Contador's yellow jersey and a spot on the podium for his old friend. BILL STRICKLAN
