BACK TO SCENE=>Qohen gazes at the photo, then bows his head, fighting his emotion. He turns the picture's face to the wall again. He walks down the long aisle to the chapel door, opens it. INT. DILAPIDATED VESTIBULE - MOMENTS LATER Qohen approaches a great oak door. He hesitates as he touches the doorknob, bracing himself, then opens it... ...to a blast of light and STREET NOISES. EXT. INNER-CITY STREET - MORNING Qohen exits. Colorful graffiti mars words etched in stone above the door: "THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE INEFFABLE NAME". He hurries past caged storefronts, eyes downcast. Near his bus stop, Qohen sees a GIRL, 10, sitting on the curb beside a toppled bicycle. She holds a skinned knee, CRYING. Qohen hesitates, looks around. No one else is there to help. He approaches the Girl cautiously.
QOHEN=>You approved it.
QOHEN=>Yes, our call. We've mentioned it a number of times.
JOBY=>You can't quit, Quinn! You're the best cruncher I got!
QOHEN=>Us. Ourselves.
DIMLY-LIT CORNER=>Two wing-back chairs flank a table with a reading lamp. In the furthest chair sits MANAGEMENT, dressed in the same taupe suit featured in the poster in Qohen's office, a suit that, chameleon-like, matches the color of the chair. He blends in so well that, at first, Qohen doesn't even see him. But when he does, Qohen stops, takes a step back. Management holds a book at eye level. With his other hand, he balances a teacup and saucer on his knee. Apparently engrossed in his reading, Management lifts the teacup, takes a delicate sip, and returns the cup carefully to its saucer. Qohen quietly turns to leave.
MANAGEMENT=>What seems to be the problem?
LIVING ROOM=>Bainsley hovers over a tray of hors d'oeuvres, stuffing her face. She spies Qohen making for the door. Suddenly a drunken Joby snags Qohen.
HALLWAY=>Away from the crowd, Qohen falls against the wall, panic- stricken. He pounds his chest, trying to free the olive. He lurches to an open doorway.
STUDY=>As if by magic, Management sits behind a mahogany desk reading his book and sipping his tea. His eyes move from the book to Qohen with an expression of mild amusement.
HALLWAY=>Bainsley performs the Heimlich maneuver on Qohen. She loses her balance, stumbles down the narrow corridor with him. She hangs on fiercely, heaving him off his feet again and again. The olive SHOOTS from his mouth, ricochets off the wall and rolls to a stop by the baseboard. Instantly a scruffy rodent appears, grabs the olive and disappears back into the wall. Bainsley releases her hold. Qohen gasps for breath.
BATHROOM=>Qohen splashes water on his face. He stares at himself in the mirror. He reaches to touch his reflection... then staggers backward with a look of pain. He sits on the toilet seat, face buried in his hands. A loud KNOCK at the door. Qohen jumps to his feet, startled.
HALLWAY=>Qohen closes the door and stands uncomfortably, wine in hand. He sniffs it distastefully, then eases to the study.
STUDY=>Qohen scans the room, puzzled. Management is gone.
HALLWAY=>Qohen stands obediently outside the bathroom door. The toilet FLUSHES. The faucet RUNS. The door opens. Bainsley exits, smoothing her dress. She flashes Qohen a sexy smile, takes the wine glass from him.
QOHEN=>Us. Ourselves.
JOBY=>That was Bob. QOHEN
MOMENTS LATER=>QOHEN opens his door to a white jump-suited Joby, who wheels in a hefty duffel bag and throws an arm around Qohen.
QOHEN=>Nothing adds up.
THE BLACK HOLE=>Light swirls violently around the inky blackness. INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT Qohen sits up in bed, struggling to orient himself. The computer's glow illuminates his face. He tilts his head. There is a distant BUZZ... INT. CHAPEL - DOOR - DAY Qohen presses the intercom.
MOMENTS LATER=>Qohen opens the door, revealing BAINSLEY. Dressed all in white with plunging neckline and short skirt, she looks like a nurse outfitted by Frederick's of Hollywood.
BAINSLEY=>Holy frying friars!
QOHEN=>Mr. Joby seemed to think you might help us get our call.
QOHEN=>In our experience, forgiveness doesn't come so easily.
QOHEN=>We prefer not to speak of it. Our past is... painful...
MOMENTS LATER=>Bainsley pokes through cupboards and drawers, trying her best not to look at Qohen. Qohen stands in the middle of the kitchen, eyes closed, hands clasped nervously. His voice is low, on the edge of breaking.
QOHEN=>We never imagined our projects actually had any purpose.
BAINSLEY=>One size fits all.
BAINSLEY=>You worry too much.
SPACE=>Bald, naked, and curled tightly in the fetal position, Qohen floats amid a backdrop of brilliant stars. His eyes open wide, staring, as he fights the dread inside him.
THE BLACK HOLE=>A maelstrom of blazing interstellar dust and matter spirals into its black depths, carrying Bainsley and Qohen with it. Bainsley freaks. She hugs Qohen tight, and now they are tumbling end over end.
BOB=>Where's your bathroom?!
CHUBS=>Fast as I could.
SLIM=>Don't lose him.
LATER=>Qohen lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Bob pushes himself back from the computer, rubbing his eyes. He COUGHS, SNIFFLES, SNEEZES.
DR. SHRINK-ROM=>Don't be such a wuss, Q. Qohen is speechless with surprise.
DR. SHRINK-ROM=>We cannot, won't not help you, Q, We wanna help you, ain't it true, But we won't help you get your call, We will not help you, not at all, Until you first shed verbal truss, First-person plural, Qs-R-Us... We got a plan for your sure cure, That gives you singular allure, But help from this computer whiz Must come without the plural biz... We do not like first-person plural...
LATER=>Intercom BUZZES. Bob opens the door. An athletic, curvaceous PIZZA GIRL, 17, enters wearing a backwards baseball cap on her blonde, pony-tailed head.
BOB=>Uh... nothing.
CHUBS=>Time to go, Bob.
MOMENTS LATER=>Qohen opens the door, and Bainsley is in his arms. Her trench coat flashes open, revealing she's naked underneath. Qohen pulls it closed. She GIGGLES.
QOHEN=>We prefer that these not be touched. The memories are... painful.
QOHEN=>But... But why?
BOB=>Any progress?
LATER=>The Clones flank the doorway, Qohen standing before them.
SLIM=>You let him go? QOHEN
CHUBS=>Duct tape works.
QOHEN=>Is it dangerous?
MOMENTS LATER=>Qohen opens the door to reveal BAINSLEY. Wearing jeans and a T-shirt, hair in a pony tail, she looks young and vulnerable.
BOB=>Um... Want to suit up?
MOMENTS LATER=>Qohen sits deep in thought, gazing into the oak's branches. The LAUGHTER of Lacy and Bonnie echoes. He looks at them. They can't get the kite airborne, but they're having fun. Qohen wrestles with a sudden impulse. Bonnie holds the kite while Lacy, at the other end of 50 feet of string, prepares to run with it. Qohen stands, takes off his sunglasses, takes a deep breath, and tries on a smile. It fits nicely. He approaches Bonnie.
QOHEN=>We'll fix that.
LATER=>Qohen sits beneath the oak tree, eyes closed, savoring the final bite of his hotdog. He opens his eyes with satisfaction, watches Bob and Bonnie holding onto the string of the airborne kite.
BACKYARDS=>... dodging trees and flower beds, koi ponds and patio furniture... running, running, running in desperation. He vaults a fence, catches his foot, sprawls on the ground. He lifts his face to the sky with a strangled SOB. Then his eyes harden. He gets to his feet, sets off running again. EXT. JOBY'S HOUSE - LATER Out of breath and dishevelled, Qohen pounds on the door. Joby opens it, all jovial.
FIRE.=>It's a small paper fire, but in Qohen's eyes it turns to: FLASHBACK - BURNING HOUSE Qohen fights through smoke and flames, CRASHES through a window, rolls on the ground, smoldering, SOBBING.
BACK TO SCENE=>Qohen throws himself on the pile of burning printouts, eyes clenched tight, mouth open in a soundless scream. He rolls over and over, burning himself, but putting out the fire. Bob gets out of bed, wobbling with fever. He COUGHS, WHEEZES, then collapses on the bed, unconscious. Qohen rushes to him. The door bursts open, pews and wrought iron SCREECHING against the floor. Slim and Chubs push through, breathless. Qohen cradles Bob in his arms. The Clones walk up the aisle.
LATER=>Qohen sits at his computer, dressed in the soul-search suit.
A FLASH OF LIGHT=>SPACE - MANCOM MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS Qohen spins weightless through labyrinthine corridors. There is no up or down. Only a dizzying expanse of computer banks stretching as far as the eye can see. Qohen weaves his way through a BUZZ of circuitry. As he approaches a computer bank, its lights FLASH, and... MANCOM PORTAL - CONTINUOUS ... Qohen is spinning headfirst through a SPARKING rainbow- lit tunnel of circuits. Qohen is inside ManCom. His braid of wires flies behind him, shooting FLAMES. Electrical currents arc from every passing circuit board to the trailing wires, creating a comet's tail of voltage. Qohen clutches his head in pain, turning sharp angles amid explosions of color, accelerating at every turn, a bolt of SCREAMING lightning. Up ahead, spinning toward him, the end of the tunnel: Space. And spinning in the center of Space: The Black Hole. Qohen closes his eyes in terror...
MANAGEMENT=>This is your mind, Mr. Leth. This is your mind in ManCom.
QOHEN=>Why would you ever want to prove that all is for nothing?
SPACE=>Arms outstretched, hammer leading the way, a comet's tail of fire and light trailing him, Qohen flies straight toward...
THE BLACK HOLE=>It spins closer and closer, an open mouth of darkness, as Qohen streaks toward... IMPACT
EXPLOSION OF COLORS=>DISSOLVE TO:
BOB=>Good. Go outside and wait for me. I'll be there in a minute.
