MELVIN=>'He's got a million miles to travel And he'll do it in one day Oh that's because old Santa Claus Got a souped-up Santa sleigh.'
MELVIN=>Jeesuz.
MELVIN=>Whut?
MELVIN=>Whut's the matter, ol' buddy?
MELVIN=>Whut are you doin' out here?
MELVIN=>That ear don't look too good to me. You want a doctor?
MELVIN=>We'll go to Beatty. Okay?
MELVIN=>This ain't but a '66 -- damn heater never did work.
HOWARD=>It's okay.
MELVIN=>What do you mean it's okay? Now you just hold on there.
MELVIN=>They belong to my little girl. Can't sleep without her bumby.
MELVIN=>Shit.
MELVIN=>Well, damn! Damn!
MELVIN=>Warm as toast! You brought me luck, ol' buddy. That heater ain't worked since my wife kicked it last time I undressed her in the car.
MELVIN=>I was lookin' for a band-aid.
HOWARD=>Keep your eye on the road.
MELVIN=>How's that?
HOWARD=>I said keep your eye on the road.
MELVIN=>Well, up yours, ol' timer.
HOWARD=>What?
MELVIN=>I said 'Up yours.'
MELVIN=>Leave 'em. They ain't but a bunch of collection notices.
MELVIN=>We ain't gonna get to Beatty any too soon.
HOWARD=>No doctors.
MELVIN=>There ain't no doctors there. Just a public health nurse.
HOWARD=>No nurses.
MELVIN=>You don't like nurses?
HOWARD=>No, I don't.
MELVIN=>Okay, okay.
HOWARD=>I'm not going to Beatty.
MELVIN=>Where are you going?
HOWARD=>Where are you going?
MELVIN=>Aw, Jeezus.
HOWARD=>I'm sorry ---
MELVIN=>Don't apologize ---
HOWARD=>I never apologize but I'll try to explain ---
MELVIN=>Don't explain!
HOWARD=>You want to stop at Beatty, fine. I don't. I'm going to Vegas ---
MELVIN=>Man, you sure beat it, don't you? Squirrelly ol' wino layin' out there in the west 40, nobody sees you 'til kingdom come -- I pick you up and what do you do? Rag me.
HOWARD=>I'm sorry.
MELVIN=>What?
HOWARD=>Nothing. I just think I'll rest a while.
MELVIN=>You do that. You lay back now -- we're coming up to Beatty now -- you still don't want to stop?
HOWARD=>No, no stops, please.
MELVIN=>You'll be sorry, you're gonna miss the knockers on the public health nurse there.
HOWARD=>Nice, huh?
MELVIN=>Do we stop at Beatty or no?
HOWARD=>No.
MELVIN=>Vegas, here we come.
HOWARD=>You're not a bad driver.
MELVIN=>I been driving since I was seven years old.
HOWARD=>How'd you reach the pedals?
MELVIN=>Make it nine. I had most of my growth by nine.
HOWARD=>I'll bet you did. Jacking off in that trailer.
MELVIN=>How'd you know I lived in a trailer?
HOWARD=>Didn't you say so?
MELVIN=>They was my three brothers in the trailer with me.
HOWARD=>In one trailer?
MELVIN=>Two of us slept on cots and two on the old dinette table. We didn't have nothing but an outhouse. I remember the first day I went to school I peed in the water fountain.
HOWARD=>Interesting.
MELVIN=>Took me right down to the Salvation Army, bought me shoes and carted me back to school.
HOWARD=>What'd you say your name was?
MELVIN=>Melvin Dummar.
HOWARD=>You're kidding me, Melvin.
MELVIN=>Hey, ol' buddy. You want to do me a favor?
HOWARD=>Depends on what it is.
MELVIN=>I've written a song.
HOWARD=>No ---
MELVIN=>It's a Christmas number -- 'Santa's Souped-Up Sleigh.'
HOWARD=>Oh God.
MELVIN=>I sent it to Hollywood Music. You know you give them the words -- they write you the music -- seventy dollars and worth every penny -- you want to hear it?
HOWARD=>No.
MELVIN=>Here's how it goes -- 'Well, he called his elves together To soup up his old sleigh So Rudolph and the other reindeer Could rest on Christmas Day
HOWARD=>Enough, sir ---
MELVIN=>Wait till you hear the talk part -- a dramatic narration like Red Sovine -- 'Now listen there fat man Just because you're Santa Claus That don't give you the right To come around and making all that noise In the middle of the night. Now I don't care who you are, fat man You get those reindeer off my roof --'
HOWARD=>Please stop ---
MELVIN=>What's the matter?
HOWARD=>My ear.
MELVIN=>Told you we should have stopped at Beatty.
HOWARD=>It's the sound.
MELVIN=>What do you mean, the sound?
HOWARD=>Your song.
MELVIN=>You're cruel, man, you know that? You're a cruel man.
HOWARD=>I have an aversion to song.
MELVIN=>You never sung in your life?
HOWARD=>Not if I could help it.
MELVIN=>That's how you got to be an ol' asshole. Now you come along on the chorus -- 'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty quick Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh He'll come in like a streak of light And he'll blast off right away...' You got that?
HOWARD=>I don't know.
MELVIN=>Now sing along with me. Or you gonna walk to Vegas. 'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty quick'
HOWARD=>Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh'
MELVIN=>Now you're gettin' it! Once more ---
HOWARD=>'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty quick Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh....'
MELVIN=>'Now now, Mr. Fat Man, what are you trying to do? Now that chimney's too small and you might fall -- so you just get down off that roof'
HOWARD AND MELVIN=>'When you hear those rockets roar You'll know Santa's on his way But he'll be back again next year In his souped up Santa's sleigh!'
MELVIN=>You done it! And you want to know something?
HOWARD=>What?
MELVIN=>You weren't bad.
HOWARD=>Come on.
MELVIN=>Now you sing me one of your songs ---
HOWARD=>I don't know any songs ---
MELVIN=>Anythin'. 'Stop And Smell The Roses,' 'My Woman, My Woman, My Wife' -- whatever you like --
HOWARD=>I don't know any songs. My father was the singer in the family, 'When The Sunset Turns The Ocean's Blue To Gold,' 'Bill Bailey.' 'Sonny, you do the verse, I'll take the chorus.' And off he'd go.
MELVIN=>What songs do you know?
HOWARD=>Me? Nothing -- 'Bye Bye Blackbird.'
MELVIN=>There you go!
MELVIN=>Lay it on me, ol' timer.
HOWARD=>Don't be crazy.
MELVIN=>'Ladeez and gentlemen -- to wind up our program tonight -- and I want y'all t'drive home safely -- y'hear? -- we got a brand new number by an ol' ol' timer -- he's been a pickin' and a strummin' for many a year -- so let's hear it for this little ditty -- the ol' timer and "Bye Bye Blackbird!" -- take it, ol' timer!!'
HOWARD=>Let me out.
MELVIN=>Come on.
MELVIN=>Ooh, that's nice -- did I hear a word?
HOWARD=>'Bye, Bye, Blackbird.'
MELVIN=>There she goes.
HOWARD=>'Pack up all my cares and woes Here I go Singing low'
HOWARD AND MELVIN=>'Bye, bye, blackbird!'
HOWARD=>'Where somebody waits for me Sugar's sweet So is she'
HOWARD AND MELVIN=>'Bye, bye, blackbird!'
HOWARD=>'No one here can love and understand me Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
MELVIN=>'Blackbird!'
HOWARD AND MELVIN=>'Blackbird Bye! Bye!'
MELVIN=>Hey!
MELVIN=>I like that song -- clean up that lyric a little and she'll take right off.
MELVIN=>How're you doin'?
HOWARD=>I'm fine. So where are you going now?
MELVIN=>Home to Gabbs. Bringin' back some stuff for our trailer my sister wanted to get rid of.
HOWARD=>What do you do in Gabbs?
MELVIN=>I work in the Mag Ox Plant. You know -- Maalox -- you get an ulcer ---
HOWARD=>I know, I know ---
MELVIN=>You know what?
HOWARD=>I know Maalox comes from magnesium oxide. All the Jews in New York drink it.
MELVIN=>Well that's more than most people know.
HOWARD=>Thank you.
MELVIN=>I wasn't complimenting you. That was just a comment.
HOWARD=>Still I appreciate it.
MELVIN=>Don't bother me, dirty work or no. Was a milkman once -- used to stink of sour milk. Now I smell like Maalox.
HOWARD=>What a shame.
MELVIN=>I remember once -- I was delivering milk in the middle of the night -- and it come to me -- why don't I get a job on graveyard like some of them old gals' husbands -- so I went around to McDonnell Douglas and Hughes --
HOWARD=>And what happened?
MELVIN=>Nuthin.'
HOWARD=>What a shame.
MELVIN=>You keep saying 'what a shame' ---
HOWARD=>I might have done something.
MELVIN=>Done what?
HOWARD=>I'm Howard Hughes.
MELVIN=>How's that?
HOWARD=>I said I'm Howard Hughes.
MELVIN=>Well I believe in anybody callin' themselves anything they want to.
HOWARD=>I appreciate that.
MELVIN=>Greasewood.
HOWARD=>Sage.
MELVIN=>Nothing like the smell of the desert after the rain.
HOWARD=>Greasewood and sage.
MELVIN=>Can I let you off at the Salvation Army?
HOWARD=>No thanks. What are you going to do?
MELVIN=>We'll keep pluggin'.
HOWARD=>Let me off at The Sands.
HOWARD=>Over there.
HOWARD=>Stop ---
MELVIN=>Right here?
HOWARD=>This is the place.
MELVIN=>You got a friend in the kitchen? Give you some money to get that ear attended to?
HOWARD=>How do you get out of this thing?
MELVIN=>Well I enjoyed it, ol' buddy.
HOWARD=>You got any money?
MELVIN=>Ain't got but a quarter change ---
HOWARD=>Thank you, Melvin.
LYNDA=>Good-bye, Melvin.
MELVIN=>Hunh?
LYNDA=>Musicians stink.
DARCY=>It's my fault.
LYNDA=>What are you talking about?
DARCY=>He didn't want a kid around.
LYNDA=>He said he wanted a kid. He said he wanted you. Been after me for months. I would divorce Melvin and he would adopt you.
DARCY=>Didn't Johnny Pike say that?

DARCY=>It doesn't matter, Ma.
LYNDA=>Or cocktail waitress ---
DARCY=>I'll have to help you.
LYNDA=>What are you talking about?
DARCY=>Don't you remember? Last time you flunked. You thought a Moscow Mule was a King Alfonse and a King Alfonse was a Moscow Mule? And then you had the fight with the bartender?
LYNDA=>I remember.
DARCY=>I think I want to go home.
LYNDA=>I can't go home, honey.
DARCY=>I know it's hard without a car for you. But you know I only have to walk to school.
LYNDA=>You miss school.
DARCY=>I miss my friends.
LYNDA=>And Daddy?
DARCY=>I don't miss him. Yeah, I miss him.
LYNDA=>Me, too ---
DARCY=>Good!
LYNDA=>But, I wouldn't go back to that sonofabitch if he were the last man on earth!
DARCY=>Don't swear, Mama.
LYNDA=>I'm sorry.

MADAM=>It'll cost you twenty-two fifty.
MELVIN=>You're kidding.
MELVIN=>I got a problem ---
MADAM=>What's your problem?
MELVIN=>I don't have twenty-two fifty.
MADAM=>What have you got?
MELVIN=>I got shit. My wife's left me, my little girl's home with my brother's family, I almost got burned up in a car, and now my best buddy's crapped out in a cathouse in the middle of the desert!
MADAM=>I see.
MELVIN=>Let me get my buddy.
MADAM=>You can't go back there for less than twenty-two fifty.
MELVIN=>All I want's the key to the car. You can have him.

MELVIN=>Give me a hand here.
MELVIN=>You married, Tina?
TINA=>I got a kid in Carson City, my hus- band's in Reno. My mother's in Vegas and you just passed my father out in the hallway.
MELVIN=>Lord.
TINA=>You do his fly. I don't want to catch him in it.
MELVIN=>You sure got a sense of humor. My name's Melvin Dummar. Let me shake your hand, Tina.
TINA=>You married, Melvin?
MELVIN=>Where could we put this if we wanted to share a few minutes together?
TINA=>In the hallway. No one will know the difference.
MELVIN=>There's only one problem.
TINA=>What's that?
MELVIN=>I haven't got twenty-two fifty.
TINA=>That's all right, he's still got seven minutes. And besides, my watch just stopped.
LUCY=>A guy's waving at you over there.
LYNDA=>Oh my God, it's Melvin.
MELVIN=>You come home with me, Lynda. Get out of this place and come home with your husband, Melvin Dummar.

LYNDA=>What do you want, Melvin?
MELVIN=>No fights, no bickering -- just carrying out the law, plain and simple. Interlocutory decree. She's final in six weeks. And my wedding ring -- keep yours if you like.
LYNDA=>Aw, Melvin.
MELVIN=>I'll be seein' you, Lynda.
LYNDA=>Hey, wait a minute! What's it say about Darcy in here?
MELVIN=>I get custody.
LYNDA=>What do you mean, you get custody?
MELVIN=>No daughter of mine's going to hang around these bars.
OWNER=>Now, wait a minute!
MELVIN=>I was goin' anyway.
OWNER=>Hey, look, Lynda --
LYNDA=>Never mind. I quit.
LYNDA=>Gee -- and I almost had to spend the night with some sonofabitch lawyer.
LUCY=>Are there any other kind?
LYNDA=>I just want to get my little girl back. My husband's divorcing me.
LUCY=>Why?
LYNDA=>Because he can't make any money and it makes him feel bad.
LYNDA=>So I can stay here as long as I want?
LUCY=>Long as you want. Until your baby comes. Don't ask me how, I always know.
LYNDA=>And did you know I'll never see the father again?
LUCY=>Don't worry, kid. You'll get an abortion, it'll all be over ---
LYNDA=>Oh, no, I had one of those. I kept dreaming of bunnies drowning.
LUCY=>I'll bet I know what that means ---
LYNDA=>Don't tell me. I'm just not going to do it again.
LUCY=>Melvin knocked you up. That bastard.
LYNDA=>Maybe Melvin. Maybe not Melvin. Melvin's okay.
LUCY=>You mean we like Melvin? A few kind men left in this world, right? But we're leaving him, right?
LYNDA=>Melvin's left me.
LUCY=>What are you going to do now?
LYNDA=>Same thing I always do. Go home to Mother.
MRS. SISK=>You want something cold to drink, Lynda?
LYNDA=>No thanks, Ma.
MRS. SISK=>I'm going out for a few minutes.

LYNDA=>Could Darcy come down and see me?
MELVIN=>You pregnant?
LYNDA=>What do you mean, am I pregnant?! What do you say a thing like that for?!!
MELVIN=>I dunno. You sound pregnant. For what other reason would you ask me to let Darcy go down there and hang around them bars?
LYNDA=>I don't go to bars, Melvin.
MELVIN=>And that air in L.A. All that smog. All them people. How preg- nant are you? For your sake, you better hope it's a girl.

MELVIN=>And then I'm going to kill you. I'd rather have you come up.
LYNDA=>Where?

MELVIN=>I don't want my little girl having illegitimate kin.
LYNDA=>Melvin?
MELVIN=>Yes, honey?
LYNDA=>I've been reading this book 'The Magic of Believing.'
MELVIN=>Yeah, what's that?
LYNDA=>It's about you.
MELVIN=>Hey.
LYNDA=>It says you can be anything you want to be if you'll just believe in yourself. And you believe in yourself -- it's just the believing hasn't been enough to let you become what you believe you can be.
MELVIN=>Rome wasn't built in a day. We'll keep plugging.
LYNDA=>I've been thinking, Melvin. I haven't been good to you. I haven't believed in you like you believe in you.
MELVIN=>How's insurance sound to you?
LYNDA=>Insurance. Real estate. Anything but bagging at Basic.
MELVIN=>Yeah, the ol' paycheck-to-paycheck. Frustratin', when I know I was born for something else.
LYNDA=>You really want to marry me, Melvin?
MELVIN=>I heard you was livin' with whores over in Reno.
LYNDA=>I knew you didn't.
MELVIN=>But I want you to know I'm not going to hold it against you, however ---

MELVIN=>That wasn't my fault -- you give me that old junker -- the motor was shot.
JIM=>You signed the note, Melvin ---
MELVIN=>Didn't you know I was in the lead for the Zenith 197K with the tri- focus picture tube?

MELVIN=>Driver of the Month! Twenty new damn accounts!
JIM=>I'm sorry about the engine, Melvin but it's your responsibility ---

JIM=>You'll pay for the engines?
MELVIN=>I asked you, you bastard, am I Driver of the Month?!
JIM=>You are.
MELVIN=>And do I get the color TV?
JIM=>Okay.
MELVIN=>Deduct your goddam engine.
LYNDA=>I'm sorry, Melvin.
MELVIN=>He's got them beady eyes and that slack tongue. Looks just like Clark Taylor.
LYNDA=>He could be yours, Melvin.
MELVIN=>Mine!
LYNDA=>You remember the morning the car was repossessed?
MELVIN=>You mean the morning you woke me up to say good-bye?
LYNDA=>I am sorry, Melvin. I prayed. I prayed for a little girl.

MELVIN=>How do you do, Miss Crockett.
LYNDA=>No thank you, Miss Burns.

BONNIE=>You have a lovely baritone, Melvin.
MELVIN=>Why thank you, Bonnie.
BONNIE=>Everybody thinks so, we're so pleased you joined us.
MELVIN=>I dunno, I felt like getting back to the church. I tried them all when I was a kid, Nazarene, Four Square Gospel, Church of Christ, but Latter Day Saints -- I was born Mormon, you know -- only one ever made me happy.
BONNIE=>Are you happy now?
MELVIN=>Can't seem to get ahead, Bonnie. The job 'n everything, you know -- bought too much car, I guess. Can't stand living under the same roof with my mother-in- law and not paying the mortgage -- baby clothes, baby furniture --
BONNIE=>The Church will help you.
MELVIN=>I know, Bonnie. Mormons are kind. You got that Mormon aura, Bonnie.
MELVIN=>Well, we'll just keep pluggin'

WALLY WILLIAMS=>Lynda, you've done it! You've opened the Golden Gate! The Golden Gate to Easy Street! Look what else you've won.
WALLY WILLIAMS=>And with that new piano, you're probably gonna wanna have it tuned and take lessons. So you'll need a tuning fork and some sheet music, so to take care of those expenses take a look at the rest....
WALLY WILLIAMS=>$10,000 in cash! That makes the total value of your Golden Gate...$11,700!
WALLY WILLIAMS=>Do you know what you're going to do with the money, sweetheart?

LYNDA=>If we're very, very careful ---
DARCY=>Do I get the tap dancing lessons?
LYNDA=>I think so.
DARCY=>And my Girl Scout uniform?
LYNDA=>I think we'll have to wait on that til next month, honey.
DARCY=>Here comes Daddy.
MELVIN=>Hey, Ortiz! Give us a picture!

MELVIN=>You're gettin' nuthin'!
LYNDA=>Melvin, you're an asshole ---
MELVIN=>Don't call me no asshole ---
LYNDA=>Then what are you?! The first time we have a prayer of getting ahead, you go out and buy a big fancy car, a big, fancy boat ---
MELVIN=>You can't take it easy on 'Easy Street.'
LYNDA=>Huh?
MELVIN=>You like this boat, Darcy?
DARCY=>I do, Daddy.
MELVIN=>You like that car?
DARCY=>I love it, Daddy.
LYNDA=>Cut it out, Melvin ---
MELVIN=>I seen cars like that boil by on the way from Reno to Vegas when I was a little kid. I'd be cleanin' out the goddam tar heater while my father was layin' road for them to drive by on, and now I've got one!
LYNDA=>You got me cryin', Melvin.
MELVIN=>Don't make fun, Lynda.
LYNDA=>We're poor, Melvin -- poor!
MELVIN=>Lynda, we're on Easy Street.
LYNDA=>I'm on Easy Street! I won!
MELVIN=>Lynda -- don't go ---
LYNDA=>Melvin, you are an asshole -- but I love you.
MELVIN=>Now wait a minute ---
LYNDA=>Aw, c'est la vie.
MELVIN=>What does that mean?
LYNDA=>It's French. I used to dream I'd be a French interpreter.
MELVIN=>You don't speak French ---
LYNDA=>I told you it was a dream.
DARCY=>G'bye, Daddy. Will I see you?
MELVIN=>You'll see me, honey.

MELVIN=>I was hoping you'd say that.
LYNDA=>Good-bye, Melvin.
MELVIN=>Good-bye, Lynda.
JIM=>You said you were a big Country and Western singer -- we built our entertainment around you -- Are you going to or aren't you, Melvin?
MELVIN=>I'm sorry, Jim, I don't feel like singing tonight.
JIM=>I knew you'd crap out.
MELVIN=>Now wait a minute ---
JIM=>Never mind, Ralph will whistle through his belly button.
RALPH=>Gee, Mel, we heard you wasn't going to sing ---
MELVIN=>New Year's maybe ---
RALPH=>I told my wife you sang Country. She's crazy for Country.
MELVIN=>I'm real sorry, Ralph. And tell your wife I'm sorry too, will you?
GEORGE=>Delgado was saying how you was yellow ---
MELVIN=>Did he?
GEORGE=>I said if Melvin don't want to sing, that's his right.
MELVIN=>What'd he say?
GEORGE=>It's not what he says, Melvin. It's what he don't say, y'know what I mean?
JIM=>Ol' Melvin Dummar promised us a song tonight -- but I'm afraid -- or am I thrilled? -- he's chickened out.
MELVIN=>Who says?! I got a song! I got a song right here!
JIM=>I guess I had it wrong -- take it, Melvin.
MELVIN=>These Japs here probably don't know 'Six Days On the Road.' You know 'Six Days On the Road?'
MELVIN=>Well this song I written is sung to 'Six Days On the Road.' And now I'm going to sing it.
MELVIN=>Well I pulled out of Rockwood Headed down the Santa Ana Freeway I got my Divco wound up and I guess it's running okay.
MELVIN=>I know Jim Delgado will be checking my books today 'Cause a big milk bill he said I have to pay But that don't bother me tonight 'Cause I can dodge ol' Jim all right Twelve hours on the road I just hope I make it home today.
MELVIN=>Well it seems like a week since I left my house last night You know I could have a lot of women but somehow it don't seem right Yeah I could find some to hold me tight but I'd never make my deliveries all right Fourteen hours on the road man I hope I make it home today.
MELVIN=>Now I work like a dog trying to collect my pay But all my customers say -- can't you come back some other day Boy I just know that there's an easier way Twenty hours on the road I just know I'm going to make it home today.
MELVIN=>Hey, that was nice. You married, Bonnie?
BONNIE=>No I'm not, Melvin Dummar. And neither are you any more.
BONNIE=>So what do you say?
MELVIN=>Gee, I don't know, Bonnie.
BONNIE=>I'll take care of you, Melvin -- til you get on your feet. I got my kid's child support money saved up ---
MELVIN=>You got kids, Bonnie --- ?
BONNIE=>I got two kids ---
MELVIN=>Oh my Lord ---
BONNIE=>Listen, Melvin, I got a cousin up in Utah -- lost his lease on a gas station -- we run it right we get a thousand a month clear -- I've been waiting for this moment -- and the moment is now -- so what do you say?!
BONNIE=>Or don't you come swinging your dick around the cashier's office no more!
MELVIN=>Bonnie? A Mormon girl -- swearing?!
BONNIE=>Bet your ass!
MELVIN=>When do we leave?

MELVIN=>Better than starving to death!
BONNIE=>I'm sorry, Mr. LaMar, Mr. Dummar is in Salt Lake today. Yessir, yessir, I understand -- yes, I'll give him the message.

BONNIE=>But our check's no good, Melvin.
MELVIN=>Easter weekend. Oughta pump a thousand gallons. Give 'em a check tomorrow, we'll have it covered by Monday. Hey, look at this, ol' Howard Hughes died. That's too bad.
NEWSCASTER MELVIN=>'The reclusive billionaire I told you about pickin' up expired at 1 p.m. this after- that old wino in the noon on a flight to Houston, desert -- Texas -- no direct heirs are known, and a search for a BONNIE will has begun ---' You told me, Melvin.
MELVIN=>Sure didn't look anything like that.
BONNIE=>Well, why would he? Those pictures are 40 years old.
SHARON=>When are we going to eat, Ma?
BONNIE=>In a minute, honey, in a minute.

REPORTER=>Mr. Dummar, the relatives of Howard Hughes claim this will is a forgery
MELVIN=>He was just an ol' wino -- asked me for some money -- I give him a quarter -- I told him I once applied for a job at Hughes Aircraft -- He told me he owned Hughes Aircraft ---
REPORTER=>Melvin, did you ever believe a dream like this could come true?
MELVIN=>In the dream, there's no hassle.
JIM DELGADO=>He may be getting 156 million dollars -- I'd just like to see the 4500 that he owes our dairy -- of course, I wish him good luck and everything.'
MELVIN=>That'll be four-fifty.
DRIVER=>You remember me, Melvin? I was with you. We were all together. You and me and Howard. But it was me that give him the quarter!
BONNIE=>'...Some of the money will pay for me to help my parents, some pay debts --- '
MELVIN=>Let's go on to the next.

MELVIN=>Haven't we heard that one?
BONNIE=>'Dear Mr. Dummar --- '
MELVIN=>Skip to the end, okay?
BONNIE=>'P.S. Do not give away the money until you have settled all your tax obligations to Uncle Sam. Re- member Joe Louis.'

LYNDA=>Hello? Who's that? Is that you, Melvin?
MELVIN=>Yeah, it's me.
LYNDA=>God, Melvin, what happened?
MELVIN=>I dunno. I guess that old wino really was Howard Hughes.
LYNDA=>Are you all right, Melvin?
MELVIN=>Yeah, I'm all right. How's Darcy?
LYNDA=>She's real proud.
MELVIN=>Don't let any of the kids at school make fun or anything.
LYNDA=>Don't worry, Melvin. Melvin?
MELVIN=>Yeah?
LYNDA=>Melvin, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
MELVIN=>Aw, Lynda, that's okay.

MELVIN=>Yeah?

MELVIN=>I dunno...I better go now. Good- bye, Lynda.
LYNDA=>G'bye, Melvin.
BOB=>What was that?
LYNDA=>Nothing....
JUDGE HAYES=>Melvin, turn your chair around and face me.
JUDGE HAYES=>Are you lying, Melvin?
MELVIN=>No, sir.
JUDGE HAYES=>Melvin, I want you to know there is a still, small voice that many people are blessed with that tells them when the truth is being spoken. It has been said, 'What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world yet lose his own soul?' If you are lying, Melvin, which you are, in my opinion, your soul may be in jeopardy, but I am not con- cerned about your soul, Melvin, right now I am concerned about your hide, because if I find that you are lying before this Court, I will make it a special duty to have a piece of your hide. I will direct that the district attorney bring a criminal prosecution against you and I will make it my special project that if you are convicted I will recommend that you do prison time. And I want you to know Nevada State Prison is no country club like the Gabbs local jail or wherever you have served time. If you're lying, you're going straight to Nevada State Prison. All right, Melvin?
MELVIN=>You bet, Your Honor.
JUDGE HAYES=>Brother Dummar, I want the truth. Where did that will come from?
MELVIN=>A man brought it to the station.
JUDGE HAYES=>You persist in the answers that were elicited from you this morning?
MELVIN=>I do, Your Honor.
JUDGE HAYES=>Do you know who wrote the will?
MELVIN=>I do not know.
JUDGE HAYES=>Did you in any way participate in the preparation of that will?
MELVIN=>No, I did not.
JUDGE HAYES=>Do you know of anyone else who participated in the preparation of that will?
MELVIN=>No, I don't.
JUDGE HAYES=>Gentlemen, I've done my best.
LYNDA=>You're doin' good.
MELVIN=>You think so?
LYNDA=>Real good.
LYNDA=>Bob ---
MELVIN=>Who's he?
LYNDA=>My husband wishes you luck.
MELVIN=>Well, you thank him.
MELVIN=>You hold on to Faron, honey. Give your mama a rest.
LYNDA=>What happens now?
MELVIN=>I got to face the meanest lawyer in the whole damn world.
MAXWELL=>How did you open the envelope?
MELVIN=>Steamed it open.
MAXWELL=>Why didn't you take a knife or a letter opener and open it the way everybody else opens an envelope?
MELVIN=>I was scared.
MAXWELL=>What were you scared of?
MELVIN=>That it might actually be true.
MAXWELL=>Why was that frightening?
MELVIN=>I don't know.
MAXWELL=>Had you ever performed this little act before of steaming open an envelope?
MELVIN=>Yes.
MAXWELL=>What were the occasions for this activity?
MELVIN=>Looking at letters that my ex-wife had written to her boyfriend and what have you, before she could mail them.
MAXWELL=>Why did you take the will to the church?
MELVIN=>Because I was too afraid to take it anywhere else.
MAXWELL=>Say that again.
MELVIN=>I thought they would help me.
MAXWELL=>Mr. Dummar, you believe, do you not, that if in the name of God, you lie, God will hear you and you will incur his wrath. You believe that don't you, Mr. Dummar?
MELVIN=>Yes, I do.
MAXWELL=>Mr. Dummar, I have a Bible here. Please stand up.
MAXWELL=>Put your hand on it, raise your right hand.
MAXWELL=>Do you swear before God that this story about how that will was left to you is the truth?
MELVIN=>I do.
MAXWELL=>All right, sit down.
MAXWELL=>That's all for now. Mr. Frost?
FROST=>Can you give me one reason on earth why this strange man would have left that will with you, Melvin Dummar?
MELVIN=>No, I don't. I've been wondering that myself.
FROST=>Did you come up with an answer?
MELVIN=>No, I haven't.
FROST=>Melvin, isn't it true you can't come up with an answer because it never happened that way?
MELVIN=>That is the way it happened.
FROST=>Well, Melvin, if it meant eternal damnation in hell would you just say it still happened that way?
MELVIN=>Yes, I would.
FROST=>Melvin, you know, don't you, that perhaps other than your relatives, there is nobody in this courtroom who believes you. You know that, don't you?
MELVIN=>I don't know what people believe. And I don't care. People have been calling me an asshole all my life. And it don't matter either way.
FROST=>Let's go back to when you got the will, and everybody celebrated and you were a national hero, Melvin. And they asked you about your getting over a hundred million dollars and I think you sobbed, choked, went into a sort of deep, heavy mood. I was kind of caught by it as I watched it on TV, but then my wife said, 'My God, it is just like the women on the game shows!' I don't watch the game shows myself, but soon after I learned you had gotten your wife on one.
FROST=>Let's go through the Golden Gate together, Melvin. Tell us the real truth. I know the dream is so much better -- My God, I was a child in Minnesota during the Depression and I can remember, kind of hoping one of those trucks going by might have a box of chewing gum on it and it would fall off. That was the dream -- it never happened. And I never tried to make it happen.
FROST=>Let's make a deal, Melvin. Tell us the truth and you know what I'll give you -- I'll plead in your be- half a whole day to have the judge give you probation. But if you don't tell the truth, I'll do my utmost to see you never breathe another free breath in the state of Nevada.
JUDGE HAYES=>Mr. Dummar, do you wish to make any response to what I would characterize as an offer from Mr. Frost?
MELVIN=>I would like to say I don't know if the will is a forgery or not. If it is, I didn't do it. And if it isn't -- I guess it's for real.
FROST=>That's no deal, Melvin.
MELVIN=>I know that.
FROST=>And I'm sorry.
MELVIN=>Yes, sir.
ROGER=>You did it, Melvin. The Judge set a trial for July 6 ---
MELVIN=>What does that mean?
ROGER=>That means he believes you. On July 6th, they're going to deter- mine the validity of the will. Like he said, 'It's the only will we've got,' plus the positive testimony by the handwriting ex- perts. I think the will is going to be admitted to probate. You're going to get your inheritance.
MELVIN=>You think so?
ROGER=>Of course it's going to be a long, long road -- but we've won the first battle. I can tell -- the T-shirt people called again -- Rockwood Dairy says they'll lift the garnishes on your entire earnings at the filling station ---
MELVIN=>Really?
ROGER=>The T-shirts are an easy fifteen thousand. What do you say?
MELVIN=>No, thanks ---
ROGER=>But you can use the cash ---
MELVIN=>You want to get paid?
ROGER=>No no no -- it's just they started paving the freeway today down from the gas station -- within two weeks, you're going to be pretty lonely up there.
MELVIN=>Don't worry about me.
ROGER=>Well, you won, Mel --
MELVIN=>Then what are you so sad about?
ROGER=>I just hope you don't have any illusions. They'll fight it through every court they can -- the relatives -- Summa -- meanwhile the government'll be taking out taxes -- the states'll be taking out taxes -- the lawyers'll be taking out legal fees -- the money's going to be siphoned off --
MELVIN=>I knew all that the day I found the will.
ROGER=>You're kidding.
MELVIN=>Melvin Dummar's never going to see 156 million dollars -- in fact he's never going to see a dime.
MELVIN=>But Howard Hughes sang Melvin Dummar's song. Howard Hughes sang 'Santa's Souped Up Sleigh.'
ROGER=>'Santa's' what, Melvin?
MELVIN=>Sorry --
LYNDA=>It's okay. Gave me a chance to get them fed. You really want to do this?
MELVIN=>See my kids? Get them out of that smog? You kiddin'?
MELVIN=>Little Red lent it to me for the trip. He went back up with Bonnie in the tow truck. Hop in, kids. There's Lifesavers and comic books back there.
MELVIN=>I bought a pair of shoes for Faron -- help him try them on, Sister.
MELVIN=>You got money to get back to L.A.?
LYNDA=>Don't worry about me, Melvin.
MELVIN=>It's in my blood.
LYNDA=>You're not going to hassle me when I want them back end of the summer?
MELVIN=>You've got my word.
LYNDA=>That's what I'm afraid of.
MELVIN=>Howsa bout you takin' me back the end of the summer?
LYNDA=>You're married, Melvin.
MELVIN=>So are you.
LYNDA=>I do miss it sometimes, Melvin -- it was always exciting. Lousy -- but exciting.
MELVIN=>We could make it that way again.
LYNDA=>It is now.
LYNDA=>Give us a kiss.
MELVIN=>End of the summer?
LYNDA=>Maybe.
LYNDA=>G'bye, kids!
MELVIN=>Greasewood.
HOWARD=>Sage.
MELVIN=>Nothing like the smell of the desert after the rain.
HOWARD=>Greasewood and sage.
HOWARD=>How about letting me drive?
MELVIN=>You?
HOWARD=>Just for a little while.
MELVIN=>Drive?
HOWARD=>I'm a goddamn good driver ---
MELVIN=>You haven't driven a car since they put out the last Hudson.
HOWARD=>I'm a goddamn good driver. I'll bet you.
MELVIN=>When we get to Vegas, I'll run her into town.
MELVIN=>Take the wheel, ol' timer.
HOWARD=>'Make my bed And light the light I'll arrive Late tonight Blackbird! Blackbird! Bye! Bye!'
