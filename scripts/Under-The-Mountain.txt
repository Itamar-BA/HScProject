FEELING WHAT SHE’S FEELING.=>Theo approaches the house with trepidation. He climbs the porch, pulls open the door.
SHUT.=>We push in towards the screen door, watching him ... then PULL FOCUS to the mesh, shutting out everything beyond.
A CELL PHONE RINGS.=>RICKY bolts upright, bangs his head, grimaces. Ricky is 18, almost cool, but not quite old enough to pull it off. CLEMENTINE, the same age, is the kind of girl guys like Ricky get only in their dreams. We see now that the car is parked under trees – a secluded park.
CLEMENTINE=>Ow – leave it – Ricky!
RICKY=>That’s good, right?
KAY=>Hello, you two!
RICKY=>They’re freaks, eh. CLIFF
CLIFF=>Who told you that? RICKY
THEO=>That was awesome! Kay looks at Cliff, worried. CLIFF
RICKY=>I don’t get why I have to babysit them. They’re not kids –
RACHEL=>It’s just voicemail.
RICKY=>Why is everything my fault? It’s outside their room, anyway.
RACHEL=>Theo, are they watching us?
RICKY=>Thanks a lot, Theo.
SNIFFS.=>Rachel and Theo pull back into the shadows, holding their breath.
RACHEL=>You don’t mean that!
THEO=>The fire-raiser.
THEO=>I need a favour.
MR JONES=>No – my name is Jones.
MR JONES=>The Wilberforces have seen you?
83A=>Ricky jerks awake with a YELP as Mr Jones climbs into the car.
POLICEMAN=>Open ... the ... door!
89A=>Looking up towards the surface. Mr Wilberforce is visible through the rippling water, searching for her. Rachel waits. A bubble of air escapes from her mouth –
THEO=>Can you drive us?
MR JONES=>Now you, Theo ... hold on to me. And whatever you do, don’t let go. Ricky looks up, snapping out of his daze.
RICKY=>Hey, what the hell?
THEO=>It’s okay, Ricky. RICKY
MR JONES=>My only hope was to find more twins. Twins who could use the stones.
MR JONES=>You know what I mean.
THEO=>It’s heavy. Warm.
THEO=>I saw other twins.
THEO=>He gave us these stones – they’re weapons, they can – RACHEL
KAY=>Especially if you’re going to wander off with complete strangers.
MR JONES=>Without me they’ll be dead by morning. You have to let me go!
MR JONES=>Come with me, quickly.
RACHEL=>How did you do that?
RACHEL=>Let’s find a way ...
RICKY=>Listen ... some stuff’s been going on ... really crazy stuff.
RICKY=>Maybe ... tonight?
RICKY=>Gimme ten minutes?
CLEMENTINE=>Ricky, what’s going on?
MR JONES=>Open your mind to the stone. Rachel seems to will Theo to succeed.
RICKY=>Like I’m gonna ask. RACHEL
I HAD NO CHOICE!=>The fire dims to a flicker.
THEO=>But at the beach –
CLIFF=>Get out of the car. RICKY
CLIFF=>Get out of the car. RICKY
THEO=>Come on, Ricky ...
ELSEWHERE IN THE TUNNELS=>A Wilberforce Drone steps into the light, searching for the twins. In human form, starting to fray a little at the edges. Two more Drones emerge from the darkness behind it. The Drone sniffs – chooses a tunnel and starts down it – WHOMP! A burst of flame momentarily drives them back, coming from – Mr Jones, hiding in wait with Rachel.
RICKY=>We’ll wait for you.
RACHEL=>We don’t need long.
