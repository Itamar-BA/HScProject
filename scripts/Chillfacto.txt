HEMMINGS=>Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
BRYNNER=>But...
BRYNNER=>...what, Sam? Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
BRYNNER=>...screwup?
HEMMINGS=>Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
HEMMINGS=>...noon.
BRYNNER=>Jesus Chri-- We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam. A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
BRYNNER=>...scientists.
HEMMINGS=>You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir? I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant. The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
BRYNNER=>Where's their protective...
BRYNNER=>...gear?
HEMMINGS=>It's a hundred degrees...
HEMMINGS=>...out here, captain. Don't you think the guys deserve a break?

LONG=>I had something of an epiphany this morning, Telstar. I eliminated the binary shell and I grafted the cobalt ion to the other side of the molecule. I think it might give us a significantly more rapid chemical ignition.
TELSTAR=>It better.

SWEENEY=>Well, Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.

LONG=>How much longer for the range and power projections?

BRYNNER=>...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons, and we're...

LONG=>But you have no choice but to follow orders.

MASON=>Yeah. Ten months we've been fishin' this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less...
MASON=>...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
MASON=>And I'm good at this. Been doing it since I was a kid. But you, I don't know. Somehow you think...
MASON=>...like a fish.
LONG=>No, that's not possible, Mason. The trout...
LONG=>...is a perfect hunter.
LONG=>He's brains without ambition...
LONG=>...sensitivity without neurosis. He's...
LONG=>...the master of his realm.
LONG=>How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
LONG=>There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
LONG=>Turn the power of the hunter against him.
LONG=>Tie a fly...
LONG=>...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
LONG=>...forcing him to strike. And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...

LONG=>Oh, no?
DARLENE=>Oh, you're two of a kind, doc. Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
DARLENE=>...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
DARLENE=>...he's smart enough to get you...
DARLENE=>...somehow.
DARLENE=>There's something else too.
LONG=>Uh, we both like to fish.
DARLENE=>Secrets.
LONG=>Ah.
DARLENE=>His I know. Yours I don't have a clue. But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.

LONG=>Is that why you're here? To blame...
LONG=>...me? Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
LONG=>I know where the blame belongs. But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew. The government did...
LONG=>...that.
BRYNNER=>Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you. Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
BRYNNER=>...and the government.
LONG=>Grateful?
BRYNNER=>Mm-hm.
BRYNNER=>Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
BRYNNER=>Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in? Well...
BRYNNER=>...you were right, of course. But after...
BRYNNER=>...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
BRYNNER=>What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
BRYNNER=>...always done, Richard?
LONG=>Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
LONG=>...men every time I've closed my eyes? But after you went away, I--
BRYNNER=>Went away?
BRYNNER=>"Went away." I like that.
BRYNNER=>Almost quaint.
LONG=>All right. After they put you away...
LONG=>...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
BRYNNER=>And let me guess. You failed.
LONG=>So far, ye-yes.
BRYNNER=>Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
BRYNNER=>...so quickly, but when it comes to cures and benefits, your...
BRYNNER=>...speed is nothing short of glacial?
BRYNNER=>Though at least you're trying, Richard. And if the road to hell is paved with good intentions...

VITELLI=>Gomez, you fight the battles you can win. Now, we've been outmaneuvered here. Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder. To do that, he has to have planned an exit point. That's where we intercept him. That's where we make our play. Now you and your men back off.
