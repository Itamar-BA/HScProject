TRUMAN=>... personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling... of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before? Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick... risks? ... sure I'm aware of the risks -- why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company?
MERYL=>Truman, you're gonna be late!
TRUMAN=>What's that?
MERYL=>It's a surprise.
MERYL=>Well, what do you think?
TRUMAN=>They're... perfect. Thank you.
MERYL=>Try it on.
MERYL=>I thought you could wear them when you do your exercises. Pre-shrunk. And they breathe.
SPENCER=>Morning, Truman.
TRUMAN=>Morning, Spencer. And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night.
TRUMAN=>Hey, Pluto.
RADIO ANNOUNCER=>Another glorious morning in Seahaven, folks.
FATHER=>Truman! Truman! Stop!
FATHER=>Come down now!
FATHER=>No!
TRUMAN=>Why? What's there?
FATHER=>Nothing. It's... it's dangerous. Come down, now! Please!
FATHER=>I told you to stay close. Don't ever leave my sight again. You've got to know your limitations. You could've fallen.
VENDOR=>How are ya, Truman?
TRUMAN=>Vital signs are good.
MISTRESS=>What do you want to do when you grow up, Marlon?
MARLON=>I want to be an entrepreneur like my dad.
SCHOOL MISTRESS=>Tell the class what an "entrepreneur" does, Marlon.
MARLON=>He makes a lot of money, Ma'am.
SCHOOL MISTRESS=>A good one does, Marlon. Perhaps I'll be coming to you for a loan one of these days.
SCHOOL MISTRESS=>What about you, Truman?
TRUMAN=>I want to be an explorer... ... like Magellan.
SCHOOL MISTRESS=>I'm afraid no one's going to pay you to do that, Truman. You might have to find something a little more practical. Besides, you're too late. There's really nothing left to explore.
VENDOR=>Is that all for you, Truman?
TRUMAN=>That's all. Thanks, Errol.
TRUMAN=>...okay, okay, let's call it what it is...I'm not going to lie to you... life insurance is death insurance... you've just got to ask yourself two questions...one, in the event of your death, will anyone experience financial loss?... and two, do you care?
TRUMAN=>Hold on, will you? This is no good. Lumps all maritime accidents together. I need drownings as a separate category.
TRUMAN=>... just think about what I've been saying and let me... hello?
TRUMAN=>Can you connect me with directory inquiries in Fiji?
CO-WORKER=>What do you know, Truman?
TRUMAN=>Can't talk. I'm sorry, ma'am. If he's in a coma, he's probably uninsurable.
TRUMAN=>Hello, operator... yes, Fiji... Do you have a listing for a Lauren Garland? ... nothing listed? ... what about a Sylvia Garland, "S" for Sylvia... nothing? Okay, thanks...
TYRONE=>How's it going, Truman?
TRUMAN=>Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.
TYRON=>Good. Good.
TRUMAN=>Tyron, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
TYRON=>I'd ask for identification.
TYRONE=>See you tomorrow, Truman.
TRUMAN=>You can count on it.
TRUMAN=>"With a mutiny but half-repressed and starvation imminent, he pressed southward till he found the long- hoped-for straits..."
MAN=>Hello?... I'm sorry, I've got more than enough life insurance.
TRUMAN=>... this isn't about insurance, this is about the great variable -- when will death occur? Could be a week, a month, a year. Could happen today... A sunbather, minding his own business, gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella... No way you can guard against that kind of thing, no way at all...
LAWRENCE=>Hey, Burbank, I've got a prospect in Welles Park I need you to close.
TRUMAN=>Welles Park on Harbor Island?
LAWRENCE=>You know another one?
TRUMAN=>I can't do it. -- I've got an appointment, er, dentist.
LAWRENCE=>You'll lose a lot more than your teeth if you don't meet your quota, Burbank. They're making cutbacks at the end of the month. You need this. Besides, a half hour across the bay. Sea air. Do you good.
TRUMAN=>Let's go further, daddy! Let's go further!
KIRK=>It's getting rough, Truman.
TRUMAN=>Please!
TRUMAN=>I tell you the traffic's insane. ... I'll never make the ferry in time. What can I do? What?... Lawrence, I can't hear you!
WOMAN=>Please...
WOMAN=>Help! Please help!
TRUMAN=>Hey! Let her go!
WOMAN=>Thanks.
WOMAN=>He did nothing.
MERYL=>Hi, honey. Look at this. It's a "Chef's-Mate." Dicer, slicer and peeler in one. Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
TRUMAN=>Gee, that's great.
MERYL=>You missed a section.
TRUMAN=>How did it go today?
MERYL=>A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw. We got three of his fingers back on.
MERYL=>I was hoping we could have a special evening.
TRUMAN=>I won't be late.
MERYL=>Did something happen today?
TRUMAN=>What could happen?
MARLON=>Whose nuts were those?
TRUMAN=>I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
MARLON=>Yeah? Outta what?
TRUMAN=>Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island... out!
MARLON=>Outta your job? What the hell's wrong with your job? You gotta great job. You gotta desk job. I'd kill for a desk job.
MARLON=>Sonofabitch. Try stocking vending machines for a living. My biggest decision of the day is whether the Almond Joys look better next to the Snickers of the Baby Ruths.
TRUMAN=>Haven't you ever gotten itchy feet?
MARLON=>Where is there to go?
TRUMAN=>Fiji.
MARLON=>Fiji? Where the hell is Fiji exactly? Near Florida? You can't drive there, can you?
TRUMAN=>See here, this is us. All the way round here, Fiji. You can't get any further away before you start coming back. Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
MARLON=>So when are you leaving?
TRUMAN=>It's not that simple. Takes money, planning. You can't just up and go. Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that. I've just got to move slow. Pick my movement. Bonus time's just around the corner. Soon as I finish the...
MARLON=>Nursery?
TRUMAN=>Spare room -- I can start thinking about selling up... and I'll be gone. Up and away on that big steel bird. I'm going, don't you worry about that.
MARLON=>I never knew anybody who wanted to leave Seahaven.
MARLON=>Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
TRUMAN=>Yeah, what happened?
MARLON=>I figured, what's the point? I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me. Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes. I realized, what the hell could be better than this? I'm telling you. What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
TRUMAN=>You think so?
MARLON=>Trust me.
MARLON=>You win.
TRUMAN=>You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
MARLON=>Sure. It's halogen. Shame it didn't hit you -- you could've sued. You coming for a drink?
TRUMAN=>I can't tonight.
TRUMAN=>Daddy!! Daddy!!
TRUMAN=>I'm sorry, Dad! I'm sorry!
MERYL=>Where have you been?
TRUMAN=>I've been thinking--
MERYL=>Oh, God.
TRUMAN=>-- I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
MERYL=>Every time you and Marlon --
TRUMAN=>-- we could bum around the world for a year on that.
MERYL=>And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.
TRUMAN=>Maybe I feel like a teenager.
MERYL=>We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. After we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
TRUMAN=>It'd be an adventure.
MERYL=>I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
TRUMAN=>That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.
MERYL=>You want to be an explorer? You don't even have a passport, Truman. I bet you don't even know how to get one.
MERYL=>This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed.
TRUMAN=>I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
TRUMAN=>-- Five... Then... fifteen... two more makes twenty.
RADIO ANNOUNCER=>Another glorious morning in Seahaven, folks. Don't forget to buckle up--
TRUMAN=>Dad...
TRUMAN=>Stop! Stop!!
TRUMAN=>Outta way! Outta way!
TRUMAN=>Hey, stop! Stop the bus!!
TRUMAN=>How are you, Mother?
MOTHER=>Well, I made it through another night.
TRUMAN=>How's your hip?
MOTHER=>Oh, just so.
MOTHER=>You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
TRUMAN=>I've got something to tell you. You'd better sit down.
MOTHER=>You look very pale, Truman. Are you taking your vitamin D's?
TRUMAN=>I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
MOTHER=>I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear?
TRUMAN=>No, I'm afraid it can't.
TRUMAN=>I know this is going to sound insane, Mother, but... I saw Dad today on Lancaster Circle. He's alive.
MOTHER=>It doesn't sound insane, Truman. I swear I see him ten times a week -- in a hundred faces. I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
TRUMAN=>It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man. And you know what else was really strange? A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
MOTHER=>About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown. We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
TRUMAN=>They never found Dad's body -- maybe somehow --
MOTHER=>-- Darling --
TRUMAN=>I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. Did Dad have a brother?
MOTHER=>You know he was an only child, like you. I know how bad you feel about what happened -- sailing into that storm. But I don't blame you, Truman. I never have.
MOTHER=>I was thinking about going lighter. What do you think?
MERYL=>What're you doing down here?
TRUMAN=>Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.
MERYL=>I know.
TRUMAN=>How do you know?
MERYL=>Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that.
TRUMAN=>What did you want?
MERYL=>I made macaroni.
TRUMAN=>I'm not hungry.
MERYL=>We really ought to toss that mower out. Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.
DAUGHTER=>What's he doing?
MOTHER=>They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
DAUGHTER=>The memory of who?
MOTHER=>Shhh!
