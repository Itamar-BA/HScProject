BRUNDLE=>What am I working on? Uh... I'm working on something that'll change the world and human life as we know it.
VERONICA=>Change it a lot or just a bit? You'll have to be more specific.
BRUNDLE=>What, you want me to be specific here, in this room, with, uh... half the scientific community of North America eavesdropping?
VERONICA=>Is there another way?
BRUNDLE=>You could come back to my lab. Listen, I'll make you cappuccino. I have a Faema of my very own. You know what that is? It's not the Dilettante's plastic kitchen model. It's one of those, uh... uh., uh, real restaurant espresso machines with a-an eagle on top and...
VERONICA=>Somehow I get the feeling you don't get out much.
BRUNDLE=>You can tell that?
VERONCA=>Yeah.
BRUNDLE=>I think you're making a mistake. I think you really want to talk to me.
VERONICA=>Sorry, I have three other interviews to do before this party's over.
BRUNDLE=>Yeah, but they're not working on something that'll change the world as we know it.
VERONICA=>They say they are.
BRUNDLE=>Yeah, but they're lying I'm not.
VERONICA=>Are you sick?
BRUNDLE=>No. Sure.
VERONICA=>You're not a very accomplished drunk.
BRUNDLE=>No, no, I'm always like this. It's, uh... motion sickness. When I was a kid, I, uh... puked on my tricycle. I hate vehicles.
VERONICA=>Should I drive more slowly?
BRUNDLE=>No, no, no. Just turn left. We're almost there.
VERONICA=>This is it?
BRUNDLE=>It's cleaner on the inside.
VERONICA=>Nice railings.
VERONICA=>You doing marine experiments?
BRUNDLE=>No, why?
VERONICA=>That fishy smell.
BRUNDLE:=>Oh, that. Used to be a packing house for fish. It's deserted right now except for me. I've got the whole fourth floor. The top floor.
VERONICA=>Want me to carry you?
BRUNDLE=>Maybe next time.
VERONICA=>Listen, uh... maybe this is a bad idea.
BRUNDLE=>No, it's too late. You've already see them. Can't let you leave here alive.
VERONICA=>I haven't seen anything.
BRUNDLE=>Those.
VERONICA=>Designer phone booths. Very cute. Hey, I bet you have a really neat jukebox in here, too, someplace, huh? Over there maybe?
BRUNDLE=>No. This is the prototype of... those. The first one I had made. It, uh... it works, but it's clunky. I call them telepods. They're controlled by this.
VERONICA=>Thank God for that. So, uh, what do they do, the phone booths?
VERONICA=>What, are you kidding?
BRUNDLE=>No, I'm serious.
VERONICA=>Okay. Here goes.
BRUNDLE=>I don't wear jewelry.
BRUNDLE=>It's nice.
BRUNDLE=>Uh... Brundle, Seth.
BRUNDLE=>Begin teleportation sequence.
BRUNDLE=>Well?
VERONICA=>Great. The world's largest microwave oven. I-I'm glade I didn't give you my Rolex. If I had Rolex.
BRUNDLE=>No, you're missing the point. Look.
VERONICA=>Teleportation?
VERONICA=>Oh... wait a minute. Is that a hologram? Where's my stocking?
BRUNDLE=>That's it. The real one. Go ahead, pick it up.
VERONICA=>I don't think I get it. What happened?
BRUNDLE=>You get it, all right. You just can't handle it. Um... your stocking has just been teleported... from one pod... to another. Uh, disintegrated... there and re-integrated there. Mmm, sort of. It'll change the world as we know it, right?
VERONICA=>Oh, no! This is, uh... This is incredible! I mean, it's not possible, is it? How have you managed to keep this quiet?
BRUNDLE=>Please sit down.
VERONICA=>How could you do this alone?
BRUNDLE=>Well, I don't work alone. There's a lot of stuff in there I don't even understand. I'm really,uh... a systems management man. I farm... bits and pieces, uh, out to guys who are much more brilliant than I am. I say... "Build me a laser this, design me a molecular analyzer that," and they do, and I just stick'em together. But, uh, none of them knows what the project really is. So...
VERONICA=>Wow! And, uh,the money? Bartok Science Industries financed this?
BRUNDLE=>Mm-hmm. But th-they leave me alone 'cause I'm not expensive. And, uh, they know they'll end up owning it all, whatever it is. So...
VERONICA=>You haven't told them?
BRUNDLE=>When I'm ready.
VERONICA=>Oh... wait a second.
BRUNDLE=>What's that? What are you doing?
VERONICA=>Well... you want me to get the quotes right, don't you?
BRUNDLE=>Quotes? No, no. I thought this was personal. You can't write about this.
VERONICA=>What are you talking about? I'm a journalist.
BRUNDLE=>Oh, no, no, no,..!
VERONICA=>You knew that.
BRUNDLE=>Uh... I'm sorry. I apologize. I made a mistake. I shouldn't have shown you this. I'm very, very... sorry.
VERONICA=>Listen... Particle magazine sent me to that party to get a story. And this is the most exciting thing... I've ever seen.
BRUNDLE=>No, no! Absolutely not. In fact, I'm gonna have to ask you for that... tape, please.
VERONICA=>Hey, you can't do that!
BRUNDLE=>Don't you dare write a story! I'd never have told and of this stuff to a journalist.
VERONICA=>But you did tell this stuff to a journalist.
BRUNDLE=>Well, yeah, in a way I suppose i did, but that...
VERONICA=>You sure did.
BRUNDLE=>Now wait a minute, wait a minute! Wait! Come here! What about your... stocking!
VERONICA=>Keep it for good luck.
VERONICA=>Well... that's it. What do you think?
STATHIS=>It's a joke.
VERONICA=>What?
STATHIS=>He's conning you. Oh, it's an old nightclub routine. The two cabinets. And you fell for it.
VERONICA=>Wait a minute. That was no nightclub.
STATHIS=>Are we having lunch?
VERONICA=>Listen, that was no nightclub routine! I was there! I saw it!
STATHIS=>Yeah? Sure... send him in. You must have made an impression.
VERONICA=>What do you mean?
STATHIS=>Your magician has followed you here.
STATHIS=>I'm Stathis Borans. I'm the editor of Particle magazine.
BRUNDLE=>Uh, Seth Brundle. Uh...
STATHIS=>Oh, I know who you are... Uh, listen, uh... why don't you two use my office? I've gotta run. If you plan to make anything disappear, please... let me know. I've got an assistant editor who's outlived his usefulness.
BRUNDLE=>You didn't waste any time.
VERONICA=>I'm not getting any younger.
BRUNDLE=>He didn't seem, he wasn't impressed by your tape?
VERONICA=>He thinks you're a con man.
BRUNDLE=>Excellent!
VERONICA=>Yeah? Well let's see what the people at Omni think about it.
BRUNDLE=>No, no! Uh, listen, Veronica... I've come here to say one magic word to you.
VERONICA=>Yeah?
BRUNDLE=>Cheeseburger.
BRUNDLE=>I've been working alone too long. I have a strong urge, uh, to talk about what I'm doing. But, um, if this gets out now... Veronica, it'll kill me. The Bartok people'll kill me... my colleagues'll kill me. It's not ready yet.
VERONICA=>It seems to work okay.
BRUNDLE=>No, something important's missing.
BERONICA=>Yeah?
BRUNDLE=>Yeah.
VERONICA=>Which is?
BRUNDLE=>I can only teleport inanimate objects.
VERONICA=>Well, what happens when you try to teleport living things?
BRUNDLE=>Not while we're eating.
VERONICA=>Can't be worse than this. Listen, you're not doing a very good job of convincing me. I think the world should know about it now and I think I should be the one to tell it.
BRUNDLE=>You should tell it, but, uh... not yet. Look, what do you got so far?
VERONICA=>Enough to make you nervous.
BRUNDLE=>Why not get more? let me become your major project. I'm talking about a book. Not a magazine article. Follow me and my work day by day in as much detail as you can stand. I don't have a life, so there's nothing for you to... interfere with. Research the background. Cover the process. The complete record of the most... earth-shattering invention ever. The one that ended all concepts of transport, of borders and frontiers, of time and space. And the book'll end... with me... transporting myself fifteen feet through space from one telepod to another. That's what's really missing... Wait for me that long.
VERONICA=>What are you doing in my apartment?
STATHIS=>I just happened to be in the neighbourhood. Felt a bit scummy. Rough day.
VERONICA=>How did you get in?
STATHIS=>I have a key, remember? You gave it to me.
VERONICA=>I knew I should have changed the lock.
STATHIS=>I knew you wouldn't.
VERONICA=>Yeah?
VERONICA=>No. That's because, very consciously, I'm lazy and disorganized.
STATHIS=>Your new playmate's an interesting guy.
VERONICA=>What playmate?
STATHIS=>The nightclub act. Brundle.
VERONICA=>Yeah?
STATHIS=>Yeah. Yeah, I was wrong. He's really... quite brilliant. He was the leader of the F-three-two team. Remember that? An inch away from the Nobel Prize for physics. He was only twenty at the time.
VERONICA=>Um... I don't even think I'm gonna do Brundle. I'm still considering the Psychology Today gig.
STATHIS=>That's not like you.
VERONICA=>Are you getting out or am I?
STATHIS=>I'll go. I have to put this issue to bed. You want me to come back later and tuck you... in?
VERONICA=>No. Key.
STATHIS=>I'll keep it... for old time's sake.
VERONICA=>You're a petty schmuck!
BRUNDLE=>Initiate in five seconds.
VERONICA=>We've got to do this Seth. Talk to the tape, get in the habit. the world will want to know what you're thinking.
BRUNDLE=>Fuck is what I'm thinking!
VERONICA=>Good. The World will want to know that. What else? Why didn't it work?
BRUNDLE=>I think it turned the baboon inside out.
VERONICA=>Why?
BRUNDLE=>It can't deal with he flesh. It only seems to work with inanimate objects, nothing that's living. It must be my fault.
VERONICA=>Why?
BRUNDLE=>Computers are dumb, they only know what you tell them. I must not know enough about the flesh myself, I'm going to have to learn. I don't want to talk anymore.
VERONICA=>Do you ever change your clothes?
BRUNDLE=>What?
VERONICA=>Your clothes, you're always wearing the same clothes.
BRUNDLE=>No, these are clean. I change my clothes every day.
VERONICA=>Five sets of exactly the same clothes?
VERONICA=>I bought some steaks. Can I make you one?
BRUNDLE=>We could go out?
VERONICA=>"Cheeseburger"?
BRUNDLE=>No. We don't have to go there.
VERONICA=>You're very cute, you know that?
BRUNDLE=>Am I?
BRUNDLE=>Ohh Ahh, My back.
VERONICA=>Oh god, Something's stuck to your back.
BRUNDLE=>Well pull it off.
VERONICA=>Sorry.
BRUNDLE=>I wondered what happened to that!
VERONICA=>Do you have any disinfectant?
BRUNDLE=>No, it's okay.
VERONICA=>I'm going to kiss it for you!
VERONICA=>I'm sorry. I just want to eat you up. You know, that's why old ladies pinch babies cheeks. It's the flesh. it just makes you crazy.
BRUNDLE=>Ronnie, Ronnie. You want to try an experiment?
VERONICA=>Sure.
BRUNDLE=>Eat this. I need an objective opinion. Yes?
VERONICA=>Well, it could use some Finesse, but it tastes like a steak.
BRUNDLE=>Okay, Now try this, teleported half.
VERONICA=>Are you serious? A monkey just came apart in there!
BRUNDLE=>Baboon. Eat.
VERONICA=>Ohh, it tastes funny.
BRUNDLE=>Funny how?
VERONICA=>It tastes, synthetic. So what have we proved?
BRUNDLE=>The computer is giving us it's interpretation of a steak. It's translating it for us, it's re-thinking it rather than reproducing it, and something's getting lost in the translation.
VERONICA=>Me. I'm lost.
BRUNDLE=>The flesh. It should make the computer crazy, like those old ladies pinching babies. But it doesn't, not yet. I haven't tought it to be made crazy by the flesh, the poultry, the steak. So I'm going to start teaching it now!
VERONICA=>What are you doing here?
STATHIS=>I followed you. "Psychology Today" My ass. You stayed with brundle all night. Why didn't I believe you? I wonder.
STATHIS=>Oh yeah. I think he'd look great in this, Don't you? I mean, for your "Time Magazine" cover, you've got to look good right?
VERONICA=>Don't you get it? I am finally onto something that's big. Huge.
STATHIS=>Oh yeah? What? His Cock?
VERONICA=>Crude Stathis. Very crude.
STATHIS=>Too perfect to believe! You're a goddess! Thank you for making my most paranoid fantasies come true!
VERONICA=>I don't have to report to you, you creep!
STATHIS=>Ronnie! You've got to talk to me!
VERONICA=>I don't have to do anything! We're finished, remember? I'll spend the night anywhere I damn well please.
VERONICA=>Sorry. I'll take this too.
BRUNDLE=>I think it's time for champagne.
VERONICA=>Oh god Seth. It's really happened. You did it. You'll never have to get car sick again!
BRUNDLE=>Or air sick, or sea sick.
VERONICA=>I know, I know. Or Tricycle sick! What's next?
BRUNDLE=>We'll send the baboon out for tests, see if he's really okay.
VERONICA=>How long will that take?
BRUNDLE=>Could be weeks.
VERONICA=>Really?
BRUNDLE=>Yeah. Why?
VERONICA=>Well I was thinking, that we could take a Holiday.
BRUNDLE=>We could?
VERONICA=>Yeah. Like an old married couple. Old man's got a couple of weeks off so they go to Florida. Someplace warm. Just the two of us?
BRUNDLE=>Just you and me?
VERONICA=>Yeah, why? Is there someone else you were thinking of Bringing along?
BRUNDLE=>No, No. Is this a romance we're having, is that what it is?
VERONICA=>Yeah, Could be a romance.
BRUNDLE=>Oh I have a great idea, Do you like Chinese food?
VERONICA=>Yes.
BRUNDLE=>We're going to have a very romantic dinner right here.
VERONICA=>Hey what's this?
BRUNDLE=>Oh yeah, from your Editor. I'm sorry, someone slipped it under the door. Hello Victor, yeah it's Seth Brundle. Oh yeah, I'll wait.
VERONICA=>Oh no.
BRUNDLE=>What?
VERONICA=>Oh nothing, it's just personal bullshit.
BRUNDLE=>I thought old married couples shared all their personal bullshit, that's how they stayed old and married.
VERONICA=>Listen Seth, Don't rush it.
BRUNDLE=>What are you talking about "Rush it"?
VERONICA=>Look, I have to go out for a few hours.
BRUNDLE=>Now? No, Ronnie! Spicy Egg plant, the champagne!
VERONICA=>Just for a few hours. I still have the residue of another life, you know, I have to scrape it off my shoe and get rid of it once and for all.
BRUNDLE=>Hi.
VERONICA=>What's this supposed to mean?
STATHIS=>It means that I'm your editor and I'm shaping your material into a story.
VERONICA=>You're the one who told me there was no story. You said Brundle was a Con man.
VERONICA=>Thanks very much. But this is not your story. It's mine.
STATHIS=>Says who? I sent you to the Bartok party to see what you could find. Your discovery is my discovery. I have a LOT of background on Brundle. He's been working on this thing for 6 years. There's material out there if you dig deep. I dug.
VERONICA=>Stathis. Everything that has to do with transportation will become obsolete. And I am right there in the middle of it. The only recorder of the event from the inside-out.
STATHIS=>Okay. Okay. Look, keep me informed? As a friend? As a professional confidant?
VERONICA=>That's all?
STATHIS=>I don't want you to disappear from my life.
VERONICA=>Okay.
STATHIS=>What about Sex? I'm not saying love, or affection. Just stress relieving Sex. You and me.
VERONICA=>You're disgusting. As always.
STATHIS=>Wouldn't want to disappoint you.
BRUNDLE=>Residue means her old Boyfriend. Stathis Borans is her old boyfriend. "from the desk of Stathis Borans". How about "Under the desk of Stathis Borans."? She's working for her old boyfriend. Now she runs out late to see him. What is this, "The Ronnie Game"? I'm catching on, I'm catching on. I didn't mean to kill your brother. But he didn't die in vain, if that's of any comfort. And as the general said; "There's nothing I'd ask you to that I wouldn't do myself boys." Hey you're alright. Looking at you I can tell you're okay. What are we waiting for? Let's do it.
BRUNDLE=>How're you doing? Now you tell me. Am I different somehow? Is it live or is it memorex? It's too bad Ronnie missed it.
BRUNDLE=>I missed you last night.
VERONICA=>It's still night. I came back. You had to celebrate without me. I'm sorry.
BRUNDLE=>I went through last night.
VERONICA=>You went through? Without testing the baboon?
BRUNDLE=>I-I-I was... drunk. I was a bit upset.
VERONICA=>You could have killed yourself!
BRUNDLE=>Are you sleeping with Stathis Borans?
VERONICA=>What are you talking about?
BRUNDLE=>I-I-I don't know. I-I just, um, get that feeling.
VERONICA=>That's why you were upset?
BRUNDLE=>I got jealous.
VERONICA=>Oh, God. Seth... you don't have to be jealous. He's an old boy... friend. He was teaching at college. I was a science major. He got me started in journalism.
BRUNDLE=>Is he still in love with you?
VERONICA=>How could he not be? Hey... wh-what about our deal? You went through and I wasn't there.
BRUNDLE=>Don't worry. I taped it for you.
VERONICA=>You did?
BRUNDLE=>Yeah.
VERONICA (O=>We've just seen the first teleportation of a human being. Dr. Seth Brundle, how did it feel going through? What did it feel like?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE:=>It feels like a stutter.
VERONICA:=>A what?
VERONICA :=>And did you feel at all different?
BRUNDLE :=>A little...unbalanced. That's all.
VERONICA :=>And now?
BRUNDLE=>I should feel exactly the same as before, but I don't. I'm not complaining. I feel very co-ordinated. And very energized. I feel as though I work better, physically. Everthing seems to just - work together better than it ever did before.
VERONICA :=>Why should that be?
BRUNDLE :=>It's possible that the teleporter has somehow...improved me.
VERONICA :=>But that's fantastic! How is it possible?
BRUNDLE :=>In reassembling me it might have - this is just a guess - but it might have just - seen where things could be improved - theoretically, and it did it. I told it to be creative, and I guess it has been.
VERONICA :=>Could this ever be dangerous?
BRUNDLE:=>Well, it's certainly unexpected. The monkeys haven't shown any change from their norm. We'll see when they come back from testing.
VERONICA:=>You still haven't answered me. Could this ever be dangerous?
BRUNDLE :=>It feels too perfect to be dangerous.
VERONICA:=>You like the way it feels?
BRUNDLE :=>Yes, I do. Want to try it?
BRUNDLE=>So, I asked the computer if it improved me and it said it didn't know what I was talking about. And that's made me think very carefully about what I've been feeling, and why. And I'm beginning to think that the sheer process of being taken apart atom by atom and put back together again, why it's like coffee being put through a filter. It's somehow a purifying process. It's purified me, it's cleansed me. And I tell you, I think it's going to allow me to realise the personal potential, I've been neglecting all these years. That I've been obsessively pursuing goal after goal.
VERONICA=>Do you normally take coffee with your sugar?
BRUNDLE=>What? Heh. You know I just don't think I've ever given me, a chance to be me. But, of course Interestingly, and the exact same moment that I achieved what will probably prove to be my life's work, that's the moment when I started being the real me finally. Listen, not to wax messianic. It may be true that the synchronicity of those two events might blur the resultant individual effect of either individual. But it is nevertheless it is also certainly true, I will say now however subjectively; that Human teleportation, molecular decimation, breakdown and reformation is inherently purging. It makes a man a King. From the moment I walked out of the pod I felt like a million bucks. You know , I think I am gonna have a cemoli after all. Waiter! I mean, What an accomplishment. But, what have I really done? All I've done is say to the world, "Lets go, Move. Catch me if you can". Waiter. Jesus Christ!
VERONICA=>How? How can you keep going? You can't have... have any fluid left in your body. We've been doing this for hours.
BRUNDLE=>Uhhhh, I'm not ready to quit yet. Hey, come on.
VERONICA]=>No.
BRUNDLE=>Come on.
VERONICA=>What's this?
BRUNDLE=>It's an attempt to distract me, that's what it is.
VERONICA=>No, really, what is it? It's like, hairs or something.
BRUNDLE=>I don't know. It's... It happens when you get older. Weird hair configurations. I don't know.
VERONICA=>They are really coarse.
BRUNCLE=>Well, I've never really been hairy enough. You know what I mean? Always too... boyish. I'm looking forward to a hairy body.
VERONICA=>No, I...
BRUNDLE=>It's one of the compensations of old age. Come here. Where are you going?
VERONICA=>No, let me go.
BRUNDLE=>Okay. Hey, hey, hey! Not my new hairs. What are you doing?
VERONICA=>Relax, Brundle. I don't really think you want a body covered with these. God! They're... really tough.
BRUNDLE=>Listen... I want you to go through. I want to teleport you as soon as possible. Right now! You'll feel incredible. Ronnie... I hardly need to sleep anymore and I feel wonderful. It's like a drug, but a perfectly pure and benign drug. The power I feel surging inside me! And I won't be able to wear you out. We'll be the perfect couple. The dynamic duo! Come on, right now!
VERONICA=>No! Hey, wait! Don't give me that born-again teleportation rap. I-I told you I'm scared to do it! What more do I have to say? I'm... not gonna do it!!!
BRUNDLE=>You're a fucking drag, you know that?
VERONICA=>Something went wrong, Seth. When you went through, something went wrong.
BRUNDLE=>No? Not you? If you're too chickenshit to be a member of the dynamic duo club, okay then, great. I'll find somebody else. Somebody who can keep up with me.
VERONICA=>Seth, you have to listen to me.
BRUNDLE=>You're afraid to dive into the plasma pool, aren't you? You're afraid to be destroyed and recreated, aren't you? I'll bet you think that you woke me up about the flesh, don't you? But you only know society's straight line about the flesh. You can't penetrate beyond society's sick gray fear of the flesh! Drink deep or taste not the plasma spring! You see what I'm saying? I'm not just talking about sex and penetration, I'm talking about penetration beyond the veil of the flesh! A deep, penetrating dive into the plasma pool!
BRUNDLE=>I'll have a scotch. Who's winning?
TAWNY=>I don't know. I hope it's Marky.
BRUNDLE=>How come?
TAWNY=>Because; I like Marky tonight.
BRUNDLE=>Well, I like you tonight. Maybe I should get involved in this too.
MARKY=>Hey pal. You're disturbing us.
BRUNDLE=>I got a hundred bucks says I can beat either one of you.
MARKY=>Take a hike, asshole!
BRUNDLE=>Here. Here's my hundred. And, I get to take the lady home for the night if I win.
TAWNY=>Says Who? do I look like a hooker to you?
MARKY=>Hey Tawny, it's an easy hundred. Come on pal, let's get it over with.
MAN IN BAR=>You better watch out. He eats chocolate bars.
MARKY=>Yeah, So I noticed.
TAWNY=>Are you a body builder or something?
BRUNDLE=>Yeah I build bodies. I take them apart and then I put them back together again.
TAWNY=>Why, you certainly took Marky apart.
BRUNDLE=>Let's go back to my place.
TAWNY=>Your place? Yeah Well, I live with my Mother anyway. But can we maybe go to a few more bars first? It's a little too early to quit.
BRUNDLE=>Sure a few more bars.
TAWNY=>Great place. There's no elevator. I can't make it.
BRUNDLE=>Oh there's an elevator.
BRUNDLE=>There. Don't you feel elevated?
TAWNY=>Woah!
TAWNY=>Wow. Are you some sort of a magician?
BRUNDLE=>Yes.
TAWNY=>So, are we going to breakfast or not?
BRUNDLE=>It's your turn.
TAWNY=>To do what?
BRUNDLE=>I want you to go through.
TAWNY=>No. I don't want to try that.
BRUNDLE=>Why not? It'll make you feel sexy!
TAWNY=>I already feel sexy. How about... A nice alcohol rub?
BRUNDLE=>Don't do that, it hurts!
BRUNDLE=>Sorry Hon'. I didn't know you had the skin of a Princess. You're real sensitive huh?
BRUNDLE=>Okay, okay! Now you're going to like it!
TAWNY=>I don't want to! I'm afraid!
BRUNDLE=>Don't be afraid!
VERONICA=>No. Be afraid. Be very afraid.
TAWNY=>Who's this?
BRUNDLE=>Oh, I forgot to tell you, I live with my mother, too. Mum, meet Tawny.
TAWNY=>I gotta go. Thanks for a wonderful time.
BRUNDLE=>Why'd you scare her off? Jealous?
VERONICA=>You're changing. Seth. Everything about you is changing. You look bad. You smell bad.
BRUNDLE=>I've never been much of a bather.
VERONICA=>Those... weird hairs that were growing out of your back, I took them to a lab. I had them analyzed.
BRUNDLE=>The hairs? Oh... yeah, that's a strange thing to do.
VERONICA=>Not as strange as the results. The guy at the lab had trouble identifying them. He finally came to the conclusion... that they were definitely not human.
BRUNDLE=>Oh! Very good.
VERONICA=>Not human... Seth. In fact... very likely insect hairs.
BRUNDLE=>That's silly. That's ridiculous.
VERONICA=>Look. Now there's more. Uh, look at your face! Something happened when you went through, Seth. You've got to get some help. I think you must be sick.
BRUNDLE=>You're jealous!!! I've become free, I've been released, and you can't stand it! You'll so anything to bring me down. Look at me. Does this look sick? Does this look like a sick man to you?
VERONICA=>No! Stop it!
BRUNDLE=>Do you know any sick men who can do that? Come here!
VERONICA=>No... Seth!
BRUNDLE=>The deal is off! I don't need you anymore.
VERONICA=>No, wait! Seth, please, wait! Seth!
BRUNDLE=>Don't come back!
VERONICA=>Oh, God! Oh, my God.
BRUNDLE=>Am I dying? Is this how it starts, am I dying?
BRUNDLE=>Give me a disc. I need the first teleportation: S. Brundle
BRUNDLE=>Run Sequence.
VERONICA=>Hello?
VERONICA=>Seth! Seth, I've been trying to reach you. Where are you?
BRUNDLE=>For the last four weeks I've been afraid to see you. Now, I'm afraid not to.
VERONICA=>Where are you? Are you at home?
BRUNDLE=>Veronica. You don't know how right you were. I've gotten, much much worse. Please come see me. Please come now.
VERONICA=>Seth? I'm here.
BRUNDLE=>Stop!
VERONICA=>Seth!
BRUNDLE=>You were right. I'm diseased and, uh... it might be contagious somehow. I wouldn't want to infect you. And it's been accelerating. It's unrelenting. Every time I look in the mirror, there's someone different, someone hideous, repulsive.
VERONICA=>What happened?
BRUNDLE=>I know an old lady who swallowed a fly perhaps she'll die.
VERONICA=>Seth... please.
BRUNDLE=>I was not pure. The teleporter insists on inner purity. I was not pure.
VERONICA=>I don't know what you mean.
BRUNDLE=>A fly got into the transmitter pod with me that first time when i was alone. Uh, the computer got confused; there weren't supposed to be two separate genetic patterns and it decided to splice us together. It mated us, me and the fly. We hadn't even been properly introduced. My teleporter turned her into a gene splicer. And a very good one. Now I'm not Seth Brundle anymore. I'm the offspring of, um, Brundle and housefly.
VERONICA=>Oh, God!
BRUNDLE=>No.
VERONICA=>Oh, God!
BRUNDLE=>Please.
VERONICA=>Seth!
BRUNDLE=>You look so pretty.
VERONICA=>What will happen?
BRUNDLE=>Oh, I think it's showing itself as a bizarre form of cancer.
VERONICA=>What?
BRUNDLE=>And general cellular chaos and revolution. I'm, just gonna have to disintegrate. In a novel way, no doubt. And then I'll die. And then it will be all over.
VERONICA=>No, no, no. I don't accept that. There must be something we can do, you know, somebody we can go to, tests that can be done.
BRUNDLE=>No! Um, I won't be just another tumorous bore talking endlessly about his hair falling out and his lost lymph nodes.
VERONICA=>Well, then what do you want me to do? Why did you call me?
BRUNDLE=>Oh, that's disgusting.
BRUNDLE=>My ear, No! I'm scared.
BRUNDLE=>Help me. Please, please help me.
STATHIS=>Don't go back to him.
VERONICA=>That's it? that's your advice?
VERONICA=>I have to go back to him.
STATHIS=>I don't believe this.
VERONICA=>If you could see how scared, and angry and desperate he is...
STATHIS=>I'm sure typhoid Mary was a very nice person too, when you saw her socially. Listen, I do not want...
VERONICA=>I don't care what you want!
STATHIS=>Alright! Fine! Do I have permission to clean your body when this is all over?
VERONICA=>Oh god...
STATHIS=>Look, how about this - You say "If only I saw him". Show me. Tape him, show me. Let me think about it. I'll come up with something.
VERONICA=>Seth? Seth?
BRUNDLE=>No, no. Up here.
BRUNDLE=>I've gotten pretty good at it haven't I? You know it's almost second nature. Stopped biting my nails. Oh look at this, what's this? I don't know. I seem to be stricken by a disease with a purpose wouldn't you say? Maybe not such a bad purpose after all.
VERONICA=>I can't stay.
BRUNDLE=>Why not? Why can't you?
BRUNDLE=>What's there to take? The disease has just revealed it's purpose. We don't have to worry about contagion anymore, I know what the disease wants.
VERONICA=>What does the disease want?
BRUNDLE=>It wants to turn me into something else. That's not too terrible is it? Most people would give anything to be turned into something else.
VERONICA=>Turned into what?
BRUNDLE=>What do you think a fly? Am I becoming a hundred and eighty five pound fly? No, I'm becoming something that's never existed before. I'm becoming "Brundlefly", don't you think that's worth a Nobel prize or two? Here.
BRUNDLE=>I'm going to give a demonstration that I think you'll want to record for prosperity.
BRUNDLE=>I think we must chronicle the life and times of Brundlefly, don't you? At the very least it should make a fabulous, Children's book. You seem tired. You got me there? How does Brundlefly eat? Well, he found out the very hard and painful way that he eats very much the same way a fly eats. His teeth are now useless because although he can chew up solid food, he can't digest it, solid food hurts. So like a fly, Brundlefly breaks down the solid with a corrosive enzyme, pleasurably called "Vomit drop". He regurgitates on his food, it liquifies, and then he sucks it back up. You ready for a demonstration kids? Here goes...
STATHIS=>My God. My God.
STATHIS=>Hey, Ronnie. Ronnie?
STATHIS=>What is it?
VERONICA=>I'm pregnant.
STATHIS=>No!? Oh no...
VERONICA=>I'm pregnant with Seth's baby.
STATHIS=>What do you want to do?
VERONICA=>I don't know. I just, I don't know...
VERONICA=>Stathis, I'm scared.
STATHIS=>It's going to be all right Ronnie. It's going to be fine.
VERONICA=>I don't think I want to loose it. Is there something wrong with me? Why am I loosing it?
STATHIS=>It's better this way Ronnie, you'll see. It's the best thing that could happen.
GYNACOLOGIST=>Okay, She's expelling it. Yeah it's coming out. I don't even think we're going to have to go in.
NURSE=>It's going to be easy. Don't worry, Honey.
VERONICA=>No. Please, no.
GYNACOLOGIST=>It'll be over soon. Here we go. Just need suction here, a little suction. Suction. Hold it. Hold on a minute. There's more in here.
VERONICA=>There's more?
GYNACOLOGIST=>Yeah. I mean a lot more. Okay. You're going to have to help us. Come on, you can push. You can push it out!
GYNACOLOGIST=>You can push it out. You can push it out. Give us a push.
VERONICA=>No! No! Ah! No! Noooo!
BRUNDLE=>I want a disk. Give me preliminary integration.
BRUNDLE=>You're relics. Yes you are. Vestigial, archeological, redundant. Artifacts of a bygone era. Of historical interest only.
BRUNDLE=>You've missed some good moments. Is that why you're here? To catch up?
VERONICA=>I wanted...
VERONICA=>No.
BRUNDLE=>Then... what do you want?
VERONICA=>I came to tell you... uh... I, uh, I just... I wanted to see you... before...
BRUNDLE=>You have to leave now... and never come back here. Have you ever heard of... insect politics? Neither have I. Insects... don't have politics. They're very brutal. No compassion, no compromise. We can't trust the insect. I'd like to become... the first insect politician. You see, I'd like to, um... but,... I'm afraid of...
VERONICA=>I don't know what you're trying to say.
BRUNDLE=>I'm saying... I'm saying I-I'm an insect... who dreamt he was a man... and loved it. But now the dream is over... and the insect is awake.
VERONICA=>No... no, Seth...
BRUNDLE=>I'm saying... I'll hurt you if you stay.
VERONICA=>Let's go! Let's do it now!
STATHIS=>Now? Wait, what did he say?
VERONICA=>I couldn't tell him! Let's go, damn it!
STATHIS=>No! I think we should wait a few days, i don't think you're in the right frame of mind.
VERONICA=>No! I want it out of my body now! you should have seen him, there could be anything in here! In me! In my body!
STATHIS=>I don't know if I can arrange it now, right now, tonight. Why do we have to run around in the dark like a couple of...
VERONICA=>Because I don't want it in my body! Do you understand me? I don't want it in my body!
CHEEVERS=>Well, okay, what's the story?
STATHIS=>She's pregnant and she wants to have an abortion.
CHEEVERS=>In the middle of the night?
STATHIS=>We have good reason to believe that this child will be deformed.
CHEEVERS=>Yes, but in the middle of the night?
STATHIS=>Look Brent, Please.
CHEEVERS=>Is it your child?
STATHIS=>No, it's the... it's the child of a man who is deformed.
CHEEVERS=>Listen, I don't mean to interfere, but I detect a certain... uncertainty here. You know there are tests we can do that determine whether or not...
VERONICA=>I don't want tests done. Tests can't guarantee anything. The baby could start off normal then become... I want an abortion, I'll do it myself if I have to.
CHEEVERS=>Okay if you can just slip into that, we'll be on our way in no time.
VERONICA=>Wait, Seth. No!
BRUNDLE=>Why did you want to kill Brundle? The baby might be all that's left of the real me. Please don't kill me.
VERONICA=>I can't have it. I'm afraid.
BRUNDLE=>Please, have the baby.
VERONICA=>I can't! I can't!
BRUNDLE=>Too bad. Too bad.
VERONICA=>No! Don't! Don't please! Please...
VERONICA=>How?
BRUNDLE=>Well. I go there .and, uh you. go there. We come apart, then and then we .come together there. You me and the baby; together!
VERONICA=>No!
BRUNDLE=>We'll be the ultimate family. A family of three joined together in one body. More human than I am alone.
VERONICA=>No, I can't.
VERONICA=>No, I can't. No... No, God!
