HOBBY=>To create an artificial being has been the dream of man since the birth of science. Not merely the beginning of the modern age, when our forebears astonished the world with the first thinking machines: primitive monsters that could play chess. How far we have come. The artificial being is a reality of perfect simulacrum, articulated in limb, articulate in speech, and not lacking in human response…
SHEILA=>Ahhh!!
HOBBY=>...and even pain memory response. How did that make you feel? Angry? Shocked?
SHEILA=>I don't understand.
HOBBY=>What did I do to your feelings?
SHEILA=>You did it to my hand.
HOBBY=>Aye. There's the rub. Undress. At Cybertronics of New Jersey, the artificial being has reached its highest form. Universally adopted mecha, the basis for hundreds of models, serving the human race in all the multiplicity of daily life. That's far enough. But we have no reason to congratulate ourselves. We are, rightly, proud of it, but what does it amount to? Sheila, open. A sensory toy, with intelligent behavioral circuits, using neurone sequencing technology as old as I am. I believe that my work on mapping the impulse pathways in a single neurone can enable us to construct a mecha of a qualitatively different order. I propose that we build a robot, who can love.
HOBBY=>Tell me, what is love?
SHEILA=>Love is first widening my eyes a little bit and quickening my breathing a little and warming my skin and touching with my -
HOBBY=>And so on. Exactly so. Thank you, Sheila.
HOBBY=>But a mecha with a mind, with neuronal feedback. You see what I'm suggesting is that love will be the key by which they acquire a kind of subconscious never before achieved. An inner world of metaphor, of intuition, of self motivated reasoning. Of dreams.
HOBBY=>Yes.
FEMALE TEAM MEMBER=>You know, it occurs to me... um...with all this animus existing against mechas today, it isn't simply a question of creating a robot who can love, but isn't the real conundrum - can you get a human to love them back?
HOBBY=>Ours will be a perfect child caught in a freeze-frame - always loving, never ill, never changing. With all the childless couples yearning in vain for a license, our little mecha would not only open an entirely new market, it will fill a great human need.
FEMALE TEAM MEMBER=>But you haven't answered my question. If a robot could genuinely love a person, what responsibility does that person hold toward that mecha in return? It's a moral question, isn't it?
HOBBY=>The oldest one of all. But in the beginning, didn't God create Adam to love him?
MONICA=>The baby was born as the first leaves of autumn fell. A baby boy. And Marion's wish came true. The boy had white hair. He was baptized Martin after his grandfather.
HENRY=>Dr Frazier. Hi. It's good to see you.
DR.FRAZIER=>Hi. How're you?
HENRY=>Listen, there was an article by Randenbach in the Journal of Chinese Medicine - they're talking about these virus locators....
DR.FRAZIER=>Hello again, Monica.
HENRY=>... microscopic, synthetic hunter killers. Did you read that article?
MONICA=>I can still hear you!
DR.FRAZIER=>I'm worried about her, Henry. She's really got me worried.
HENRY=>Yeah, I know.
DR.FRAZIER=>She's in the most difficult position of feeling she should mourn the death of your son. After five years your instincts tell you to mourn him, too. But medicine assures us that mourning is inappropriate, that Martin is merely pending.
HENRY=>Pending.
DR.FRAZIER=>So all her grief goes undigested. Henry, your son may be beyond our science, but it's your wife who can still be reached.
FIRST ASSISTANT=>The screening process was extremely difficult. It was almost tougher than building the prototype.
SECOND ASSISTANT=>Of our 2,000 employees a surprising few met your minimum requirements for the in-house testing. Initiate. Employment record. Quality of life style. Query. Internal data. Loyalty to the firm. And...in this individuals case, a family tragedy that may qualify him above the rest.
HOBBY=>I'll see him.
MONICA=>Henry.
HENRY=>Don’t kill me.
MONICA=>Henry, what are you doing?
HENRY=>I love you. Don’t kill me. Door’s closed.
DAVID=>I like your floor.
MONICA=>I can't accept this! There is no substitute for your own child!
HENRY=>You don't have to accept it or even try - it's not too late to take him back!
MONICA=>What were you thinking?!
HENRY=>I'll do whatever you want me to do!
MONICA=>You think I can just, I can just...
HENRY=>I'll do whatever you want me to do!
MONICA=>I don't know... what to do.
HENRY=>I know, I know…I'll return him to Cybertronics first thing in the morning, it’s gone.
MONICA=>Good. I mean Henry, did you see his face? He's, he's so real. But he's not...
HENRY=>No, he's not.
MONICA=>I mean, inside he's like all the rest, isn't he?
HENRY=>A hundred miles of fiber, yeah.
MONICA=>But outside he just looks so real... like he is a child.
HENRY=>A mecha child.
MONICA=>A child...
HENRY=>The show of faith my company has placed on me...on us, is extraordinary. Now there are a few simple procedures we need to follow if and when you decide to keep David. If you decide to keep him, there’s an imprinting protocol consisting of a code string of seven particular words which need to be spoken to David in the predefined order that’s been printed here. Now Monica, for our own protection, this imprinting is irreversible. The robot child’s love would be sealed, in a sense hardwired, and we’d be part of him forever.
MONICA=>Silly man. Of course I’m not sure.
DAVID=>Would you like me to sleep now?
MONICA=>Uh...
HENRY=>Good Idea. Good idea. Monica?
MONICA=>Uh..well..it's late, you know…it's after nine,so uh...
HENRY=>Yeah. Ten past.
MONICA=>How..how late do they let you stay up?
DAVID=>I can never go to sleep, but I can lay quietly, and not make a peep.
MONICA=>So those pajamas will fit you, and uh, we'll be in to check on you first thing in the morning.
DAVID=>Dress me?
MONICA=>You know I'm gonna say good night...while you...boys be boys.
HENRY=>Raise your arms.
DAVID=>Is it a game?
MONICA=>Yes. Hide and Seek. Found you. That’s your bedroom. Just go and play.
MONICA=>Ahhh!
DAVID=>I found you.
MONICA=>Out! Out! Get outta here! And close the goddamn door!
DAVID=>Is it a game?
MONICA=>Now, I'm gonna read some words, and…uh...they won't make any sense, but I want you to listen to them anyway. And...look at me all the time. Can you do that?
DAVID=>Yes, Monica.
MONICA=>Can you feel my hand on the back of your neck?
DAVID=>Yes.
MONICA=>Does any of this hurt?
DAVID=>No.
MONICA=>Okay. Now. Look at me? Ready? Cirrus. Socrates. Particle. Decibel. Hurricane. Dolphin. Tulip. Monica. David. Monica...
DAVID=>What were those words for, Mommy?
MONICA=>What did you call me?
DAVID=>Mommy.
MONICA=>Who am I, David?
DAVID=>You are my Mommy.
MONICA=>Hmm...!
HENRY=>You smell lovely. I love it when you wear this stuff.
MONICA=>Will you still love me when it's all gone?
HENRY=>No.
MONICA=>Wha...stop it!
HENRY=>But we can get married again and begin with a fragrance that's not in such short supply.
MONICA=>Hmmm...
HENRY=>Gotta go...Come on, we're late!
HENRY=>Hello, David.
DAVID=>Hello, Henry.
MONICA=>Walk us out, alright, sweetheart? Come on.
MONICA=>Henry, your tie!
HENRY=>Yeah I know! I'm helpless!
MONICA=>You're hopeless!
HENRY=>Oh, it's not bad...
MONICA=>Oh, it's just tight...I was just trying so hard.
HENRY=>You see the way he rearranged that...
MONICA=>He tries so hard to please me. He has a way with my coffee.
HENRY=>And it’s creepy. You can never hear him coming. He’s just always there.
MONICA=>He is only a child.
HENRY=>Monica, he’s a toy.
MONICA=>He’s a gift, from you.
DAVID=>Do I smell lovely?
MONICA=>I'll go look...
DAVID=>Mommy? Will you die?
MONICA=>Well....one day David. Yes, I will.
DAVID=>I’ll be alone.
MONICA=>Don’t worry yourself so.
DAVID=>How long will you live?
MONICA=>For ages. For fifty years.
DAVID=>I love you, Mommy. I hope you never die. Never.
MONICA=>Yes...
HENRY=>Darling? We're becoming unfashionably, unreasonably late.
MONICA=>This belonged to Martin. My son.
TEDDY=>Grr-rowr!
MONICA=>His name is Teddy. Teddy, this is David.
DAVID=>Hello, Teddy.
TEDDY=>Hello, David.
MONICA=>David, Teddy is a Super-Toy, and I know you’ll take good care of each other.
TEDDY=>I am not...a toy.
MONICA=>Henry? Sorry...!
HENRY=>What were you doing up there?
MONICA=>Ohh, I'll tell you in the car. C'mon.
DAVID=>Is fifty years a long time?
TEDDY=>I don't think so.
MONICA=>David, I'll get it! Honey, hand it to me.
DAVID=>Look what I can do! Hello...?
MONICA=>Hah...Yes?
DAVID=>Mrs. Swinton, could you hold a moment? I have an urgent call from your husband.
MONICA=>Monica: Yes. I will. Uh..uh...David, I need to talk to the phone now.
DAVID=>Monica? Monica can you hear me, Monica?
MONICA=>Let the phone talk now. Come on.
DAVID=>Monica, can you hear me? Pick up the phone Monica.
MONICA=>Run along, play with Teddy.
DAVID=>Pick up the phone, Monica! Oh my god Moni...
MONICA=>Hello? Henry? What is it? Wha...What? When? Oh god...
MONICA=>David? The most wonderful thing in the whole world has happened. This is Martin. This is my son.
TEDDY=>Martin, no...
MARTIN=>We’ll have a contest, to see who he comes to first. Come here, Teddy! Come here, boy! Teddy! Come here! You call him too.
DAVID=>Come here, Teddy.
MARTIN=>Come on...
DAVID=>Come here, boy.
MARTIN=>Teddy! Teddy! Come here! Come on, Teddy! Come here!
DAVID=>Come here, Teddy.
MARTIN=>Come here, Teddy! Teddy! Teddy come! C'mere!
DAVID=>Come here, Teddy.
MARTIN=>Come Teddy! Come!
TEDDY=>Mommy! Mommy!
MONICA=>Are they torturing you , Teddy?
MARTIN=>He used to be a Super-Toy, but now he’s old and stupid. You want him?
DAVID=>Yes, please.
MARTIN=>So, I guess now you’re the new Super-Toy, so what good stuff can you do? Oh, can you do 'power' stuff, like, uhhh, walk on the ceiling or the walls? Anti- gravity? Like, float, or fly?
DAVID=>Can you?
MARTIN=>No, because I’m real. Can you break this?
DAVID=>I better not.
MARTIN=>These things...they do look better in pieces. They do.
DAVID=>I can’t.
MARTIN=>Stand up. Look, they made you bigger than me.
DAVID=>Who did?
MARTIN=>Well, they did, the dollmakers. They made you taller. Why don't you look like one?
DAVID=>Like one...
MARTIN=>You're not cute like a doll. You just look like someone’s ordinary kid. When’s your birthday?
DAVID=>I never had a birthday.
MARTIN=>Okay…well, when were you first built? When’s your ‘build day’?
DAVID=>I don’t remember.
MARTIN=>Okay, what’s the first thing you can remember?
DAVID=>A bird.
MARTIN=>What sort of bird?
DAVID=>A bird with big wings. And feathers sticking up from the bottom.
MARTIN=>Could you draw it?
DAVID=>Yes.
MARTIN=>That looks like a peacock. Can you say peacock?
DAVID=>Peacock.
MARTIN=>Can you say pea?
DAVID=>Pea.
MARTIN=>Now, say that two times fast.
MONICA=>Okay. Then you gotta put the green ones….
MARTIN=>Read to us?
MONICA=>Hey... Let’s see. Oh, yes….
MARTIN=>David’s going to love it.
MONICA=>As soon as the show was over, the showman went into the kitchen, where the whole sheep which he was preparing for supper was roasting on a slowly turning spit in the furnace. When he saw that there was not enough wood to finish roasting it, he called Harlequin and Pulcinella and said, 'Bring me in Pinocchio! You will find him hanging on a nail. He is made of nice dry wood and I’m sure he will make a nice fire for my roast.
MONICA=>Pinocchio worked until midnight, and instead of making eight baskets, he made sixteen. Then he went to bed, and fell asleep. As he slept, he dreamt he saw the fairy, lovely and smiling, who gave him a kiss, saying, 'Brave Pinocchio, in return for your good heart, I forgive all your past misdeeds. Be good in the future, and you will be happy.' Then the dream ended, and Pinocchio awoke, full of amazement. You can imagine how astonished he was when he saw that he was no longer a puppet, but a real boy, just like other boys.
HENRY=>Josephine evidently has.. uh.. taken a leave of absence.
MONICA=>Oh my God...
HENRY=>Umm...humm.
MONICA=>Well...I saw that coming.
HENRY=>How could you see that coming? They were fabulous together.
MONICA=>Oh Come on! She was miserable... I mean...
HENRY=>Well, he never said they were miserable.
MONICA=>Yeah.. . that’s because.... Was that because of the cutbacks or what?
HENRY=>I have no idea. They certainly don’t tell me anything.
MONICA=>Didn't they have a bit of a weight problem?
HENRY=>Well so do I...I mean...
MONICA=>Do not! That is ridiculous.
HENRY=>...well... all right look.. I don’t know... isn’t there...something about inner beauty?
TEDDY=>You will break.
MONICA=>Oh that is ridiculous.
HENRY=>Exactly...oh, work has become so silly. Does he eat?
MONICA=>I’m not sure.
HENRY=>You’re not supposed to do that.
MONICA=>David, what are you doing? David?!
HENRY=>Do you have the manual... the book?
MONICA=>Martin, put the fork down. Put it down now.
HENRY=>Stop. Stop, David. Will you stop?
MONICA=>David?! Stop it. Martin you’re provoking him. OK?
HENRY=>David, stop it!
MONICA=>The two of you stop it! Stop it now!
FIRST A.R.T. TECH=>Hmmm..spewed in the code blockers.
SECOND A.R.T. TECH=>Smell that garlic!
FIRST A.R.T. TECH=>Should clone the chest bridge... Ehhh...!
SECOND A.R.T. TECH=>Did you locate the servers?
FIRST A.R.T. TECH=>Don't touch the merchandise.
SECOND A.R.T. TECH=>It's all swamp in here.
FIRST A.R.T. TECH=>You... made a mess of yourself! Spinach is for rabbits, people and Popeye. Not robo-boys.
SECOND A.R.T. TECH=>Go ahead insert your cells... let's do a patching on the lower shelves.
DAVID=>It's OK, Mommy. It doesn't hurt!
FIRST A.R.T. TECH=>The activators are all hooked up on this side.
HENRY=>Monica...
MONICA=>No! I just have to...
SECOND A.R.T. TECH=>That's not all of it... that's not all of it...
MARTIN=>If you do something really, really, really special for me, a special mission, then I'll go tell Mommy...I love you, and then she'll love you, too.
DAVID=>What shall I do?
MARTIN=>You have to promise, and then I'll tell you.
DAVID=>You have to tell me, and then I'll promise.
MARTIN=>I want a lock of Mommy's hair. I'll share it with you. And if you had it, and wore it, she might love you even more, like the princess in the movie we saw. When she had the prince's hair in her necklace thing, he loved her.
DAVID=>We can ask her-
MARTIN=>No! It has to be a secret mission. Sneak in to Mommy's bedroom, in the middle of the night, and chop…it off.
DAVID=>I can't, Martin. I'm not allowed.
MARTIN=>You promised. You said 'tell me and then I'll promise', didn’t you?
HENRY=>David! -
HENRY=>Why did you do that?! Why did you do that?! Talk to me! David god damn it, talk to me David! Why did you do that, David?! Why did you do that?! Tell me WHY-DID-YOU-
MONICA=>Henry, what are you doing - you’re hurting him! Henry, let him go! Henry you’re hurting him! You’re hurting him! You- DON’T BREAK HIM!!
DAVID=>Henry…I wanted Mommy to love me…more.
MONICA=>Oh my god…
HENRY=>What?
MONICA=>Oh my god, I think I cut my eye.
HENRY=>Lemme see.
MONICA=>Oh god, I think it's bleeding!
HENRY=>Come…come...come on, wash it out.
MONICA=>It's normal for little boys to feel jealous and competitive. Martin's only been home a month and...it's normal for brothers to challenge each other. He...He was playing a game, he made a mistake, and he - he's practically human.
HENRY=>That's not how he looked holding the knife.
MONICA=>Scissors.
HENRY=>It was a weapon.
MONICA=>Why do you keep imagining that he was purposely trying to harm me?
HENRY=>Uh, because we don't know the answer to that! How is he worth the risk to you, or to Martin, or to us as a family?
MONICA=>I will not let you take him back. You told me what would happen if you ever took him back.
HENRY=>Think about this. If he was created to love, then it's reasonable to assume he knows how to hate. And if pushed to those extremes, what is he really capable of?
DAVID=>Happy birthday, Martin. I made this for you.
TOD=>This him? This your little brother?
MARTIN=>Technically…no.
TOD=>He’s mecha!
DAVID=>What’s mecha?
TOD=>We're orga-nic, you’re mecha-nical. Orga, mecha, orga...
MARTIN=>Tod...
TOD=>...mecha, orga, mecha...
MARTIN=>Tod...stop.
TOD=>I didn’t know they even made little kids.
DAVID=>I cannot.
MARTIN=>Come on...
BOY#3=>It feels so real.
TOD=>Mecha real. Does he have DAS?
TOD=>Damage Avoidance System. DAS. It’s a pain-alert system. Our serving-man has it. It’s so they don’t go picking up fire with their bare hands and stuff.
DAVID=>Keep me safe, Martin. Keep me safe!
MARTIN=>Lemme go!
DAVID=>Keep me safe Martin!
MARTIN=>Lemme go! Mom! Mom! Mommmmmmmm!
DAVID=>Keep me safe, keep me safe, keep me safe, keep me safe...
MONICA=>Henry!
HENRY=>Come on..come on, man...Martin! Take a breath...cough it up ! Thatta boy, that's a great boy!
MONICA=>Oh...thank God...thank God thank God!
HENRY=>Call Frazier-tell him what happened! Get him outta there!
MONICA=>Hey David?
DAVID=>Mommy! Mommy!
MONICA=>David, wait. I need to speak to to you for a minute, okay?
DAVID=>Okay!
MONICA=>Yeah...
MONICA=>Oh, David, these are beautiful! Thank you. Um...
DAVID=>And Teddy?
MONICA=>Yeah, and Teddy.
DAVID=>Thank you Mommy! Thank you so much!
MONICA=>Tomorrow's gonna be just for us, okay?
MONICA=>You know you don’t eat.
DAVID=>Yes. But I like sitting at the table.
DAVID=>Is it a game?
MONICA=>No.
DAVID=>When will you come back for me?
MONICA=>I'm not, David, you...you'll have to be here by yourself.
DAVID=>Alone?
MONICA=>With Teddy.
DAVID=>No. No! No, no, no, no! No, Mommy please!
MONICA=>Shhh...shhh...
DAVID=>No! No! Please no Mommy no!
MONICA=>They're going to destroy you...
DAVID=>No, Mommy!
MONICA=>David, they'll destroy you. David...David, they're going to destroy you!
DAVID=>Mommy, No! I'm sorry I broke myself! I'm so sorry I cut your hair off and I'm oh so sorry I hurt you and I hurt Martin and I hurt Henry and I hurt everybody!
MONICA=>No...no, no...I have to go. I have to go! Stop it!
DAVID=>I'm sorry!
MONICA=>Stop it! I have to GO!
DAVID=>Mommy, no! Mommy! MOMMY! Mommy, if Pinocchio became a real boy and...and I become a real boy can I come home?
MONICA=>But that's just a story, David.
DAVID=>But that story tells what happens!
MONICA=>Stories are not real! You're not real!
DAVID=>Why do you want to leave me? Why do you want to leave me??! I'm sorry I'm not real, if you let me I'll be so real for you!
MONICA=>Let go. Let go! Let GO!!
PATRICIA=>I'm afraid...
JOE=>Of me? That I will hurt you?
PATRICIA=>Yes...
JOE=>I think... you're afraid of letting go. I think you're afraid of happiness. And this is starting to excite me. Are you afraid of seeing the stars...Patricia? I can show you how to reach them.
PATRICIA=>I'm afraid... of what you've got under there. May I see what it looks like first?
JOE=>Is this your first time... with something like me?
PATRICIA=>I've never been with mecha.
JOE=>That makes two of us.
PATRICIA=>I'm afraid it will hurt.
JOE=>Patricia...once you've had a lover robot, you'll never want a real man...again. Are these the wounds of passion?
PATRICIA=>Do you...do you hear that music?
JOE=>You... are a goddess, Patricia. You wind me up inside. But you deserve much better in your life. You deserve... me.
JANE=>Hey, Joe, whaddaya know?
JOE=>Hey, Jane, how’s the game?
FRONT DESK CLERK=>Hey, Joe, whaddyaknow?
JOE=>Hello, Mr. Williamson. Place a DND on room one-oh-two, please.
MR. WILLIAMSON=>Sure thing. 'ere ya go. Here y'are.
JOE=>It's a good thing I ran into you. Thanks Mr. Williamson.
MR. WILLIAMSON=>Sure thing.
JOE=>Mustn’t keep a lady waiting.
JOE=>Ms. Bevens. It’s Joe. At your service. I’ve been counting the seconds since last we met. Have you been crying, Samantha? I found a tear.
MR. BEVINS=>Hey Joe, whatdya know? How many seconds has it been, the last time the two of you were together?
JOE=>Two hundred and fifty five thousand, one hundred and thirty three.
MR. BEVINS=>Goodbye, Sam. And never forget, you killed me first.
JOE=>I’m in bad trouble.
DAVID=>If I am a real boy, then I can go back. And she will love me then.
TEDDY=>How?
DAVID=>The Blue Fairy made Pinocchio into a real boy. She can make me into a real boy. I must find her, so I can become real. There must be someone in the whole world who knows where she lives.
DAVID=>What do we do?
TEDDY=>We run now.
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Any old iron? Any old iron? Any old iron? Any old iron? Expel your mecha. Purge yourselves of artificiality. Come along now, let some mecha loose to run, any old unlicensed iron down there? Hey, see that? Could be a human thing.
BALLOON OPERATOR=>No, he’s scanning cold. No expiration date, no ID.
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>What’s a new model doing loose and unregistered?
BALLOON OPERATOR=>Sir, it’s a late generation lover mecha.
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Well, there’s a relief from all this antique iron. You are certain he’s not a man? I wouldn’t want a repeat of the Trenton incident.
BALLOON OPERATOR=>Sir, he’s free range mecha, running hot.
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Let’s reel him in, boys. Sic the hounds on the rest. Shake down Shantytown.
MECHA NANNY=>What’s your name?
DAVID=>My name is David.
MECHA NANNY=>Hello David! How old are you?
DAVID=>I don’t know.
MECHA NANNY=>Do you need someone to take care of you? Would you like a nanny? I have many good references.
DAVID=>Do you know where the Blue Fairy lives?
MECHA NANNY=>Don't be afraid, David.
TEDDY=>I'll break, David.
MECHA NANNY=>Une chanson douce que me chantait ma maman...
TEDDY=>Ow!
MECHA NANNY=>Une chanson douce que me chantait ma maman...
FRONT GATE ATTENDANT=>Hello. Anybody lose this? Hello? This your dog?
TEDDY=>Grr-rrrr...
FRONT GATE ATTENDANT=>Take it to lost and found for me, okay?
TEDDY=>Do you know David?
TEDDY=>Where's David? Can you help me find David? I have to find David. Are you taking me to David?
MECHA COMEDIAN=>Can you shoot me OVER the propeller thing? Yea, I don't need to go through it. Ahhh, I was considering it, but I changed my mind.
RINGLEADER=>Gentlemen! Start... your... engines! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. What about us?!
CROWD=>What about us!
RINGLEADER=>What... about... us?!
CROWD=>What about us!
RINGLEADER=>We are alive, and this is a celebration of life! And this is commitment to a truly human future!
DAVID=>Hello, Teddy.
TEDDY=>Hello, David.
PAPA=>Take it! Take it. Backgrounds rolling...
LITTLE GIRL=>Papa?
PAPA=>Not on the...
TECHNICIAN=>...biker helm.
LITTLE GIRL=>Papa?
PAPA=>Amanda, go on back outside, honey. It's too smoky in here.
AMANDA=>There's a boy in the cage.
PAPA=>What'd you say?
AMANDA=>There's a boy the cage.
PAPA=>A boy?
AMANDA=>A real boy. He's stuck in the cage.
PAPA=>In the pen, honey?
AMANDA=>In the jail place...
TECHNICIAN=>Random crowd reaction-
PAPA=>Hey, Russell, will you get a remote near the pig pen? Bring it up on VT1. Lemme see what she's talking about.
RUSSELL=>Move it up on one.
TECHNICIAN=>Push in.
RUSSELL=>What are you looking for?
PAPA=>Amanda said she saw a little boy in there.
TECHNICIAN=>Push in! Denny, let's go wide on the shot - wide on the shot.
PAPA=>Honey, how do you know about this?
AMANDA=>The bear told me.
TEDDY=>I told her.
DAVID=>Why is this happening?
TAXI MECHA=>History repeats itself. It's the rite of blood and electricity.
GRUMPY MECHA=>So, when the opportunities avail themselves, they pick away at us, cutting away our numbers so they can maintain numerical superiority!
DAVID=>Keep me safe! Keep me safe! Keep me safe! Keep me safe!
CREW MEMBER=>Not yet! Just this one here!
DAVID=>Keep me safe. Keep me safe. Keep me safe...
FEMALE CREW MEMBER=>Mike, security? Mike! Do you have any reports of any missing kids, any missing children? Alright, thanks.
PAPA=>How'd you get in there? Boy! You, boy! Hey, what's your name? I won't bite ya. Come on over where I can see ya. Hey hey, it won't hurt ya. I just need to see. You're a machine.
DAVID=>I'm a boy.
AMANDA=>Is he a toyboy?
DAVID=>My name is David.
PAPA=>Impossible.
NANNY MECHA=>Goodbye, David.
PAPA=>No one builds children. No one ever has. What would be the point?
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Aye, he could be a custom job. Some rich, and lonely, scaredy pusses pretend child.
GRUMPY MECHA=>I'm a custom job. 75 years ago I was Time Magazine's mecha of the year!
PAPA=>Eh, this work is first rate. A lot of love went into him. David! You are one of a kind, you know that? Who made you?
DAVID=>My mommy made me.
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Her womb was your factory, eh? One of those built to aspire to the human condition. What is the name of your maker? Serve U.S., E.Z. Living, Robbyville? Simulate-City, Santern, Cybertronics, Sidekicks--
DAVID=>Monica is my mommy.
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Can I speak with you for a moment? You thinking of not putting him in the show?
PAPA=>Something as original as this you don't toss out with the rest of the garbage!
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Yeah, well, I say originality without purpose is a white elephant, but if money is your purpose, then here's your refund-- my compliments.
PAPA=>What are you going to do with him?
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Put him where he belongs-- in show business.
JOE=>It was certainly my good fortune running into you!
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Let go of him.
JOE=>Let go of me.
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>I said let go of him.
JOE=>I'm trying!
DAVID=>Don't let go. Keep me safe! Don't let go!
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Suit yourselves.
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Ladies and gentlemen. Girls and boys and children of all ages! What will they think of next?! See here: a bitty box, a tinker toy, a living doll. 'Course we all know why they made them. To seize your hearts. To replace your children! This is the latest iteration to the series of insults to human dignity. An underground scheme to phase out all of God's little children. Meet the next generation of child designed to do just that!
DAVID=>Don't burn me! Don't burn me! I'm not Pinocchio! Don't make me die! I'm David, I'm David, I'm David!
WOMAN IN CROWD=>Mecha don't plead for their lives! Who is that? He looks like a boy...
DAVID=>Don't make me die...don't make me die! I'm David!
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Built like a boy to disarm us! See how they try to imitate our emotions, now!
DAVID=>I'm David, I'm David, I'm David...
LORD JOHNSON-JOHNSON=>Whatever performance this sim puts on, remember we are only demolishing artificiality! Let he who is without 'sim' cast the first stone.
CROWD=>He's just a boy... He's just a boy, Johnson...You're a monster!...
PAPA=>Get them out of there before they tear this place apart.
HOBBY=>Where?
HOBBY=>Is he alive?
TEDDY=>I see the moon.
DAVID=>Is it real?
TEDDY=>I don't know, David.
DAVID=>Is it coming?
TEDDY=>I can't tell yet.
DAVID=>Let's not walk this way.
JOE=>Where are we going?
DAVID=>This way now.
JOE=>Are you in bad trouble, have you run away from someone?
DAVID=>My mommy told me to run away.
JOE=>Why did she say that?
DAVID=>I guess...because Henry didn't like me.
JOE=>Why was that?
DAVID=>Martin came home.
JOE=>And who is he?
DAVID=>Martin is Mommy and Henry's REAL son. After I find the Blue Fairy, then I can go home. Mommy will love a real boy. The Blue Fairy will make me into one.
JOE=>Is Blue Fairy mecha, orga, man, or woman?
DAVID=>Woman.
JOE=>Woman. I know women! They sometimes ask for me by name. I know all about women. About as much as there is to know. No two are ever alike, and after they've met me, no two are ever the same! And I know where most of them can be found.
DAVID=>Where?
JOE=>Rouge City. Across the Delaware. Too far for our feet. We'll need help to get there. And, it is not without peril. We will have to journey....towards the moon.
DAVID=>Are there many women in Rouge City?
JOE=>As there are stars at night.
DAVID=>And how will we find just one?
JOE=>We will ask Dr. Know! There is nothing he doesn't. Exactly what name do you give this woman?
DAVID=>She is...just Blue Fairy.
JOE=>Blue Fairy. In the world of Orga blue is the color of melancholy, yet the services I provide will put a blush back on anyones cheek. I will change the color of your fairy for you. She will scream out in the moonlight...'Ah, oh yes, oh god, oh yes, oh god, oh god'...she will make you a real boy for I will make her a real woman and all will be right with the world, because you held my hand and saved my brain. So once again my customers may ask for my by name 'Gigolo Joe, whatdoyaknow'!
DAVID=>Why do you do that?
JOE=>That's just what I do. Now follow me, and don't fall behind. All roads lead to Rouge! Don't they say that, eh? Don't they just....
JOE=>There are girls your age who are just like me. We are the guiltless pleasures of the lonely human being. You're not going to get us pregnant, or have us over for supper with mummy and daddy. We work under you, we work on you, and we work for you. Man made us better at what we do than was ever humanly possible. If you can manage us a lift to Rouge City, all this, and much, much more, can be yours.
TEENAGER=>Get in!
JOE=>Say ‘Ah!’
JOE=>Over there is 'Here, Kitty Kitty'. That's where the agency held my trial when I was made new. That's 'Tails'...very 'hoity-toity'. Only sunrise gents and sunset ladies. I've never been asked to perform there. Strictly sierra class robots who have no idea how to live. Can't even speak English, all made in Sweden. Couldn't tell a joke from a poke. There's Mildred! I have to show you inside Mildred!
DAVID=>Are you her?
JOE=>That’s Our Lady of the Immaculate Heart. The ones who made us are always looking for the ones that made them. They go in, look around their feet, sing songs, and when they come out, it's usually me they find. I've picked up a lot of business in this spot.
DAVID=>But Joe, where's Blue Fairy?
JOE=>That's what we're gonna find out when we ask Dr. Know. It's where everyone goes who needs to know.
DR.KNOW=>Starving minds, welcome to Dr. Know! Where fast-food for thought is served up 24 hours a day, in 40,000 locations nationwide. Ask Dr. Know, there's nothing I don't!
DAVID=>Tell me where I can find the Blue Fairy.
DR.KNOW=>Question me you pay the fee, two for five you get one free!
JOE=>He means two questions cost five Newbucks with a third question on the house. In this day and age, David, nothing costs more than information.
DAVID=>That's everything!
JOE=>Ten Newbucks and a ten copper comes to 7 questions for Dr. Know.
DAVID=>That should be enough!
JOE=>He's a smooth operator. He'll test our limits, but try we must.
DR.KNOW=>Greetings colleagues. On author, factual text or fictionalized text, 1st or 3rd person, usual literacy range from primal level to the post doctural, usual span of styles from fairy tale to religious, who’s who, or where’s where - or, flat fact.
DAVID=>Flat-fact?
DR.KNOW=>Thank you for question number one. 'Flat-fact' is a term demanding an equal answer with interpretive speculation... merely not the... and what you are saying is basically that is what you-
DAVID=>That shouldn't count, that wasn't my question!
JOE=>You must take care not to raise your voice up at the end of a sentence. 'Flat-fact'.
DAVID=>Where is Blue Fair-REE?
DR.KNOW=>In the Garden. Vascostylis blue fairy. Blooms twice annually with bright blue flowers on a branched inflorescence. A hybrid between Ascola Meda Arnold. You have 5 more questions.
DAVID=>Who is Blue Fair-REE?
DR.KNOW=>Are you sad, lonely, looking for a friend? 'Blue Fairy Escort Service' will find a mate for you! You have 4 more questions.
DAVID=>Joe. Try fairy tale.
JOE=>New category. A fairy's tail.
DAVID=>No! Fairy tale!
JOE=>No. Fairy tale.
DAVID=>What is Blue Fairy?
DR.KNOW=>Pinocchio, by Carlo Collodi. At the signal, there was a rustling as flapping of wings, and a large falcon flew to the windowsill. What are your orders, beautiful fairy, he asked...
DAVID=>That’s her.
DR.KNOW=>...For you must know that the child with blue hair was no other than the good hearted fairy who had lived in that wood for more than a thousand years...
JOE=>David! David!
DAVID=>That’s her!
JOE=>It was an example of her. But I think we're getting closer.
DAVID=>But if a fairy tale is real, wouldn’t it be a fact? A flat fact?
DR.KNOW=>...then the dream ended, and Pinocchio awoke, full of amazement...
JOE=>Say no more. New category, please. Combine Fact with Fairy Tale. Now. Ask him again.
DAVID=>How can the Blue Fairy make a robot into a real, live boy?
DR.KNOW=>Come away,O human child! To the waters and the wild With a fairy, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping then you can understand.
DAVID=>Will you tell me how to find her?
DR.KNOW=>Discovery is quite possible. Our blue fairy does exist in one place, and one place only, At the end of the world Where the lions weep. Here is the place dreams are born.
JOE=>Many a mecha has gone to the end of the world... never to come back! That is why they call the end of the world 'MAN-hattan'.
DAVID=>And that is why we must go there!
JOE=>Wait! What if the blue fairy isn't real at all, David? What if she's magic? The supernatural is the hidden web that unites the universe. Only orga believe what cannot be seen or measured. It is that oddness that separates our species. Or what if the Blue Fairy is an electronic parasite that has arisen to hold the minds of artificial intelligence? They hate us, you know? The humans...They'll stop at nothing.
DAVID=>My Mommy doesn't hate me! Because I'm special, and...unique! Because there has never been anyone like me before! Ever! Mommy loves Martin because he is real and when I am real, Mommy's going to read to me, and tuck me in my bed, and sing to me, and listen to what I say, and she will cuddle with me, and tell me every day a hundred times a day that she loves me!
JOE=>She loves what you do for her, as my customers love what it is I do for them. But she does not love you David, she cannot love you. You are neither flesh, nor blood. You are not a dog, a cat or a canary. You were designed and built specific, like the rest of us. And you are alone now only because they tired of you, or replaced you with a younger model, or were displeased with something you said, or broke. They made us too smart, too quick, and too many. We are suffering for the mistakes they made because when the end comes, all that will be left is us. That's why they hate us, and that is why you must stay here, with me.
DAVID=>Goodbye, Joe.
POLICE OFFICER=>You’re in big trouble.
TEDDY=>Be careful David, this is not a toy.
AMPHIBICOPTER=>Destination please?
JOE=>MAN-hattan.
AMPHIBICOPTER=>Mecha Restricted Area. Manhattan. Destination Achieved.
JOE=>Man-hattan, the lost city in the sea at the end of the world.
DAVID=>Where the lions weep.
TEDDY=>Grrrrrr…
DAVID=>Turn around, Joe.
JOE=>We're not going to give up yet, David.
TEDDY=>Grrrrrr…
DAVID=>Turn around, Joe. Turn all the way around.
TEDDY=>Grrrrrr…
DAVID=>Professor Hobby? Professor Hobby?
JOE=>Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a Faery, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
DAVID=>Professor Hobby? Professor Hobby? Hello? Hello? Is this the place they make you real?
DAVID II=>This is the place they make you read.
DAVID=>Are you real?
DAVID II=>I guess.
DAVID=>Are you me?
DAVID II=>I'm David.
DAVID=>You’re not.
DAVID II=>Yes, I am! I’m David!
DAVID=>So am I.
DAVID II=>Hello, David. - Can you read? Can you sit down, and we can read together? Let’s be friends.
DAVID=>You can’t have her.
DAVID II=>I can’t hear you.
DAVID=>She's mine. And I'm the ONLY one. I'm David! I'm David! I'm David! I'm David! I'm... , I'm David! I'm David! I'm David! I'm special! I'm unique! I'm David! You can't have her! I'm David...I'm David...I'm David...
HOBBY=>David? David!
DAVID=>I'm David...I'm David...
HOBBY=>Yes, you are David.
DAVID=>Professor Hobby?
HOBBY=>Yes David, I've been waiting for you.
DAVID=>Dr. Know told me you'd be here. Is Blue Fairy here, too?
HOBBY=>I first heard of your Blue Fairy from Monica. What did you believe the Blue Fairy could do for you?
DAVID=>She would make me a real boy.
HOBBY=>But you are a real boy. At least as real as I've ever made one which by all reasonable accounts would make me your Blue Fairy.
DAVID=>You are not her. Dr. Know told me she would be here at the lost city in the sea at the end of the world where the lions weep.
HOBBY=>And that's what Dr. Know needed to know to get you to come home to us. And it's the only time we intervened; the only help that we gave him to give to you, so you could find your way home to us.
DAVID=>I thought I was one of a kind.
HOBBY=>My son was one of a kind. You are the first of a kind. David?
DAVID=>My brain is falling out.
HOBBY=>Would you like to come meet your real mothers and fathers? The team is anxious to talk to you. I want you to wait here and I'll gather them up. We want to hear everything about your adventure. We want thank you, and tell you what's in store for you next.
DAVID=>Mommy.
DAVID=>I saw it Joe, I saw it! The place where she lives! She's right down there, Joe!
JOE=>She is?
DAVID=>She's waiting for me, we have to go!
JOE=>Uh-oh. When you become a real boy, remember me to the ladies when you grow up!
DAVID=>Good-bye Joe.
JOE=>Good-bye David. I am...I was!
TEDDY=>David, please, be careful.
DAVID=>The Blue Fairy's all right!
TEDDY=>What happened?
DAVID=>I don't know.
TEDDY=>We are in a cage.
DAVID=>Blue Fairy? Please...please, please make me into a real live boy. Please...Blue Fairy? Please...please...make me real. Blue Fairy? Please, please make me real. Please make me a real boy. Please, Blue Fairy, make me into a real boy. Please...
NARRATOR=>And David continued to pray to the Blue Fairy there before him, she who smiled softly, forever...she who welcomed forever. Eventually the floodlights dimmed and died, but David could still see her palely by day, and he still addressed her, in hope. He prayed until all the sea anemones had shriveled and died. He prayed as the ocean froze and the ice encased the caged amphibicopter, and the Blue Fairy too, locking them together where he could still make her out - a blue ghost in ice - always there, always smiling, always awaiting him. Eventually he never moved at all, but his eyes always stayed open, staring ahead forever all through the darkness of each night, and the next day...and the next day...
DAVID=>Teddy, we’re home. Mommy?! Mommy?! We’re home! Where are you?!
DISEMBODIED VOICE=>David…Daaaaaaaaavid…David…Daaaaaaaaaavid…
BLUE FAIRY=>You have been searching for me, haven't you David?
DAVID=>For...my whole life.
BLUE FAIRY=>And what after all this time have you come to ask me?
DAVID=>I had a wish to make.
BLUE FAIRY=>And what is your wish?
DAVID=>Please make me a real boy so my Mommy will love me, and let me stay with her.
BLUE FAIRY=>David, I will do anything that is possible, but I cannot make you a real boy.
DAVID=>Where am I? This looks like my house, but it is different.
BLUE FAIRY=>Yes, it is different, but it's also your home. We read your mind, and it's all here. There's nothing too small that you didn't store for us to remember. We so want you to be happy. You are so important to us David, you are unique in all the world.
DAVID=>Will Mommy be coming home soon? Is she out shopping with Martin now?
BLUE FAIRY=>David, she can never come home, because two-thousand years have passed, and she is no longer living. Dearest David, when you are lonely, we can bring back other people from your time in the past.
DAVID=>If you can bring back other people, why can’t you bring back HER?
BLUE FAIRY=>Because we can only bring back people whose bodies we dig up from the ice. We need some physical sample of the person, like a bone, or a fingernail.
TEDDY=>David.
DAVID=>Yes Teddy.
TEDDY=>Do you remember when you cut some of Mommy’s hair?
DAVID=>Henry shook me.
TEDDY=>And you dropped her hair?
DAVID=>I know.
SPECIALIST=>Give him what he wants.
BLUE FAIRY=>Dearest David, your wish is my command.
DAVID=>Hey Joe what do you know?
SPECIALIST=>David, I often felt a sort of envy of human beings and that thing they call 'spirit'. Human beings had created a million explanations of the meaning of life in art, in poetry, in mathematical formulas. Certainly, human beings must be the key to the meaning of existence, but human beings no longer existed.
DAVID=>Maybe…maybe she will be special, maybe she will stay.
SPECIALIST=>I thought this might be hard for you to understand. You were created to be so young.
DAVID=>Maybe the one day will be like that one day inside the amphibicopter, maybe it will last forever.
SPECIALIST=>David, you are the enduring memory of the human race, the most lasting proof of their genius. We only want for your happiness. David, you've had so little of that.
DAVID=>If you want for my happiness, then you know what you have to do.
SPECIALIST=>Listen. Can you hear that? The new morning has come. Go to her David, she's just waking up this instant.
DAVID=>I found you.
MONICA=>Hi.
DAVID=>Hi.
MONICA=>I must’ve dozed off. How long have I-
DAVID=>Would you like some coffee? Just the way you like it?
MONICA=>Yeah, I’d love a coffee. It'll wake me up.
DAVID=>Okay.
MONICA=>You never forget how, do you?
DAVID=>No. I never forget.
MONICA=>I must be a little confused. What day is it?
DAVID=>It is…today!
NARRATOR=>And as the day wore on, David thought it was the happiest day of his life. All the problems seemed to have disappeared from his mommy's mind. There was no Henry, there was no Martin, there was no grief, there was only David.
NARRATOR=>David had never had a birthday party, because David had never been born. So they baked a cake, and lit some candles.
MONICA=>Now make a wish.
DAVID=>It came true already.
NARRATOR=>By now indeed the windows were beginning to dim. David drew the shades without even needing to be asked.
MONICA=>I really ought to be tucking you in. Strange. Hmm...How fascinating. I can hardly keep my eyes open. I don't know what's come over me. Such a beautiful day. I love you David. I do love you. I have always loved you.
NARRATOR=>That was the everlasting moment he had been waiting for. And the moment had passed, for Monica was sound asleep - more than merely asleep. Should he shake her she would never rouse. So David went to sleep too. And for the first time in his life, he went to that place where dreams are born.
