PALE MAN=>Nice place, Mr. Case. Industrial espionage must be paying well these days.
CASE=>Let's see your warrant.
PALE MAN=>Oh, we're not arresting you. The law books haven't quite caught up with your technology. Breaking into the computer matrix by cerebral projection... that's a little tough to prosecute, don't you think?
SENSE/NET POLICEMAN=>Lieutenant...
PALE MAN=>That's it, gentlemen.
CASE=>I've got money...
PALE MAN=>Not anymore. You've burned at least three multinational corporations, Mr. Case. You're getting a little too good at your craft, my friend. That's bad for business. Bad for everybody.
CASE=>What's that?
PALE MAN=>Your retirement plan.
PALE MAN=>He'll be hallucinating for... oh, about fifteen hours.
PALE MAN=>What's left after that is all yours.
CHIBA CITY, JAPAN=>ONE YEAR LATER
CAT=>Scan transparencies lies open on the tabletop before them.
TENSHU=>Dr. Kiyoto say scan reveal many secrets. You suffer serious damage to nervous system. Someone play bad trick on you.
CASE=>Yeah, I know all that. I used to be a wire man, understand? Plugged straight into the matrix.
TENSHU=>No longer possible for your mind to enter matrix. Nervous system incompatible for computer. You try again, you fry like egg.
TENSHU=>Nerve splice very risky. Dr Kiyoto now
TENSHU=>He say he admires your bone structure. You make beautiful woman. We correct nature's mistake.
CASE=>Tell him no thanks. I got lousy legs.
RATZ=>Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
CASE=>Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
HOOKER=>Oh, you're an artist? I love artists.
RATZ=>He was once the artiste of light-fingered microchippery, my dear. Need your credit rating changed? Interested in a few corporate secrets? Case was the man. Now he is the artiste of the slightly funny deal. Isn't that right, Herr Case?
CASE=>Sure. Someone's gotta be funny around here.
RATZ=>I saw your girl yesterday.
CASE=>I don't have a girl.
RATZ=>No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
RATZ=>Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
CASE=>You're pleasant tonight.
RATZ=>Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
CASE=>Yeah.
LINDA LEE=>Hello, Case.
CASE=>I thought you already left.
LINDA LEE=>Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
CASE=>Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
LINDA LEE=>People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
CASE=>I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
LINDA LEE=>This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
CASE=>Where did you here that?
LINDA LEE=>Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case. I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
CASE=>You stupid, stupid, son of a bitch. That was supposed to be a clean score! You've got me fencing Yakuza goods on Yakuza turf...
CASE=>Shit...
CASE=>We've been set up, old buddy.
CASE=>So long, Julie. Don't forget to feed the cats.
CASE=>There's going to be trouble. Get your security over here...
GUNFIRE=>is lost in the noise of the arcade.
THE BIG YAKUZA=>Looking like a Sumo wrestler stuffed into an ill-fitting suit. The laser-site on his modified Uzi casts the quavering dot on Case's chest.
RATZ=>Arigatou, Bao-san. Rare to see you out this time of night.
JO JO BAO=>I'm afraid I could not sleep. Worry makes me restless.
RATZ=>Is that so?
JO JO BAO=>Yes. I'm worried for your friend. The man they call Case.
RATZ=>Not my friend. My customer.
JO JO BAO=>Of course. Forgive me.
RATZ=>Ah...No thanks. I can try to get in touch with him for you. Can't promise anything, you understand.
JO JO BAO=>I would greatly appreciate this. You see there is a small matter that must be settled between Case and I.
LINDA LEE=>Hello?
RATZ=>Is Case there?
LINDA=>No. Who's this?
RATZ=>A friend. I have a very important message. Are you listening?
LINDA=>Yes, but I...
RATZ=>Jo Jo Bao says Case should bring the goods the Yakitori Stand at the arena in one hour. Jo Jo gets the goods or Case gets orchids. He'll understand.
OFFSCREEN VOICE=>Hold it.
WOMAN=>No lights. I can see just fine the way I am, thanks.
WOMAN=>Now close the door.
CASE=>That was you at the arcade.
WOMAN=>I just wanted to put the Big Yak down, not kill him. I've got enough problems without Yak heat.
MOLLY=>His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
CASE=>Why should I want to meet him.
MOLLY=>Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
CASE=>What's my end?
MOLLY=>You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
CASE=>This better be good.
MOLLY=>What is it?
CASE=>... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
MOLLY=>Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
CASE=>Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
MOLLY=>You mess with me, you'll be playing Jai Alai with Jesus.
CASE=>No!
MOLLY=>Case!
MOLLY=>She's dead man. C'mon.
ARMITAGE=>Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
CASE=>You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
ARMITAGE=>Very well.
ARMITAGE=>What you're seeing here is the London stock market crash of last September. This was the first in a series of setbacks for the international banking community.
ARMITAGE=>The collapse of Aerospace International...
ARMITAGE=>The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
CASE=>What does this have to do with me?
ARMITAGE=>Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
CASE=>Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
ARMITAGE=>Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
ARMITAGE=>If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
CASE=>My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
ARMITAGE=>What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
CASE=>I'd say you were full of shit.
CASE=>Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
ARMITAGE=>First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr.
CASE=>It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and are going to be real buddies. Terms?
ARMITAGE=>We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
CASE=>Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
ARMITAGE=>Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
ARMITAGE=>One more thing, Mr. Case... Be prepared to travel light.
BOSTON-ATLANTA METROPOLITAN AXIS:=>THE SPRAWL
CASE=>Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
MOLLY=>Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
MOLLY=>Couple of months.
CASE=>What about before that?
MOLLY=>For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
CASE=>Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
MOLLY=>I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
CASE=>Maybe something's onto him.
MOLLY=>What's that supposed to mean?
NURSE=>Mr. Smith?
CASE=>Yeah. It means there is no Santa Claus, Molly. So cover your ass. Just cover your ass.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST=>Count backwards from ten, please.
CASE=>Ten... nine...
CASE=>Eight... seven... six.
CASE=>Five... four...
CASE=>Three... two...
MOLLY=>Easy. You're still full of endorphins.
MOLLY=>You've been calling her name.
CASE=>What?
MOLLY.=>Your girl, Linda Lee. You've been calling her name.
MOLLY=>She must have really loved you.
CASE=>It got her killed.
MOLLY=>Sure Case... Love kills and we're all the walking wounded.
MOLLY=>Now close your eyes... You're asleep and you don't even know it.
CASE=>Holy shit...
MOLLY=>Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
CASE=>How long have I been out?
MOLLY=>Almost two days.
CASE=>I gotta know... did it work>
MOLLY=>We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
CASE=>How soon is soon enough?
MOLLY=>Couple of days. They'll examine you.
MOLLY=>That's not going to help.
CASE=>The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
MOLLY=>Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
CASE=>What the fuck... are you serious?
MOLLY=>Go ahead...
CASE=>That's cute. Very fucking cute. What else did this guy do to me when he had me opened up like a goddamn fillet?
MOLLY=>Oh, I dunno... He was saying maybe that you're a little too ballsy.
CASE=>No...
ARMITAGE=>I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
CASE=>I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
ARMITAGE=>You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
CASE=>Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
ARMITAGE=>Good, because you've got a new one.
ARMITAGE=>There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
CASE=>You son of a bitch...
MOLLY=>Easy...
ARMITAGE=>Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
CASE=>Why'd you do it, Armitage?
ARMITAGE=>The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
CASE=>Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
MOLLY=>What's an A.I.
ARMITAGE=>An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
CASE=>First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
ARMITAGE=>This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
CASE=>Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
ARMITAGE=>It hasn't yet.
CASE=>I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
ARMITAGE=>Dixie McCoy
CASE=>Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what know.
ARMITAGE=>I've arranged for him to work with us.
CASE=>That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
ARMITAGE=>I know. You ever work with ghosts, Case?
CASE=>What are you talking about?
ARMITAGE=>Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct. Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
CASE=>Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
ARMITAGE=>You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
CASE=>And then?
ARMITAGE=>Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you
CASE=>It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
ARMITAGE=>We have work to do.
CASE=>I'm going in.
MOLLY=>You're not ready yet. They said two days.
CASE=>I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
MOLLY=>If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
CASE=>I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
MOLLY=>What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
CASE=>On a good run... yeah.
MOLLY=>So you're a wire junkie.
CASE=>When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
MOLLY=>A regular Fagan.
CASE=>Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
MOLLY=>Too late?
CASE=>Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
CASE=>I've been running the matrix ever since.
CASE=>The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
MOLLY=>Won't that mean you're dead?
CASE=>Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
MOLLY=>Dixie McCoy didn't.
CASE=>The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
MOLLY=>Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
CASE=>Take it easy. This is what I'm good at.
TECHNICIAN=>We have a bogey at access C-27. Bogey at C-27.
VOICE=>Trajectory?
OPERATOR=>We've lost contact. sir. He's entered the matrix.
BIGELOW=>Is this all you've got on him?
TECHNICIAN=>Yes sir. Whoever he is, he's good.
FIGURE=>If he was so good he wouldn't have crashed a security checkpoint. I doubt he'll make the same mistake again.
BIGELOW=>I thought we eradicated these wire jockeys. These... what do they call themselves, Duprey?
PALE=>MAN, the Sense/Net operative that injected Case with the microtoxin. His name is Lt. Roland Duprey.
DUPREY=>Cowboys, sir. I retired the last one personally over a year ago.
YAMIR=>Then how do you explain this?
DUPREY=>I don't know yet. My people are doing everything that they can to trace it.
TESSIER=>Do you realise what a security breach would mean right now? If our mysterious guest discovers that an Artificial Intelligence is running loose in the matrix infiltrating other computer systems, it could cause a worldwide panic.
BIGELOW=>Find this cowboy, Duprey. Do whatever you have to to stop him.
DUPREY=>What about the A.I.?
TESSIER=>That is our problem, Lieutenant. Please concern yourself with the matter at hand.
BIGELOW=>One more thing, Duprey...
BIGELOW=>You fuck this up, I'll have your cerebral cortex degoused. You'll need a playback unit to remember how to pee. Am I making myself clear?
DUPREY=>Don't worry, gentlemen. I'll keep your fat out of the fire.
CASE=>Dixie. Dixie McCoy? Is that you, man?
MCCOY=>Hey, bro.
CASE=>It's Case. Remember me?
MCCOY=>Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
CASE=>Fine, Dixie. Fine.
MCCOY=>Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
CASE=>Yeah. That was me.
MCCOY=>Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
CASE=>As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
MCCOY=>Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
CASE=>That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
MCCOY=>Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
CASE=>Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
MCCOY=>Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
CASE=>Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
CASE=>Dixie?
CASE=>You're a ROM construct... Understand?
DIXIE=>It's cold. Why's it so goddamn cold.
CASE=>Dixie?
DIXIE=>What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
CASE=>Right...
DIXIE=>I can't feel nothing because I am nothing. Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
CASE=>You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
DIXIE=>Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos. Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
CASE=>What?
MCCOY=>Later...
CASE=>Dixie?
TECHNICIAN=>Lieutenant... we have some unusual activity in C sector.
DUPREY=>Is that our bogey?
TECHNICIAN=>No, it's inorganic. Could be your phantom A.I..
TECHNICIAN=>Sir?
DUPREY=>I do believe one of our problems is about to cancel out the other one.
MOLLY=>You okay?
CASE=>...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
VOICE=>Hello, Case
CASE=>Who is this?
VOICE=>Wintermute. Sorry I missed you last night.
VOICE=>I've been waiting for you, Case. It's time we talked.
ARMITAGE=>You ran without us.
CASE=>I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
ARMITAGE=>Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
CASE=>What's he doing to my gear?
MAN=>_Your_ gear. Hah! I spent weeks customising this stuff. It looks like you've been playin' with it in the bathtub, man.
ARMITAGE=>This is Finn, our tech man.
FINN=>Pleased to meecha, I'm sure.
ARMITAGE=>What's this?
CASE=>Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
ARMITAGE=>Did you trace it?
CASE=>No, but it traced me.
CASE=>Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
ARMITAGE=>What about McCoy?
CASE=>He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
ARMITAGE=>Prepping your trip.
CASE=>Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
ARMITAGE=>Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
CASE=>That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
ARMITAGE=>You'll be linked during the entire operation.
CASE=>Linked?
FINN=>Remote simstim. Moll's wired for full sensorium access. I thought this guy was a player.
ARMITAGE=>He is. Just been out of touch for awhile.
FINN=>Well, you're going to get a kick out of this. Link switches here. Boom. You're wired straight into her senses. Sight, sound, touch, taste... the whole enchilada. You'll know just how tight those jeans really are. Now you wanna give this a try? I'm supposed to be on my lunch break.
MOLLY=>Morning, Case.
MOLLY=>Welcome aboard.
CASE=>Yeah, well it's working.
MOLLY=>Larry, that you?
MOLLY=>You're slotting Chinese, Larry.
LARRY=>Sorry, Client from Hong Kong, you know.
MOLLY=>I need a suit. Something special.
LARRY=>Patience.
LARRY=>Molly's got a rider. Larry doesn't like that.
MOLLY=>Didn't know you were so sensitive. Costs a lot to get that sensitive.
LARRY=>This says you got someone using your eyes.
MOLLY=>My partner.
LARRY=>Lose the rider. Then we talk.
MOLLY=>Case, you take off, okay?
LARRY=>Now, Pretty Poison, what exactly did you have in mind?
MOLLY=>I heard you have mimic polycarbon.
LARRY=>Instant environmental playback. It's the latest... but it'll cost you.
CASE=>Dixie... you here?
DIXIE=>I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
CASE=>I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
DIXIE=>Who got you into this?
CASE=>A guy who calls himself Armitage.
DIXIE=>Never heard of him.
CASE=>Nobody has.
CASE=>I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
DIXIE=>No problem, amigo.
CASE=>What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
DIXIE=>Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass. Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
CASE=>What?
DIXIE=>When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
SECRETARY=>There's a call for you on line four, sir. He won't identify himself, but he says it's urgent.
DUPREY=>Yes...
VOICE=>The word is you're scanning for a wire freak. You want to catch a cowboy, you need a posse.
DUPREY=>Who is this?
VOICE=>Just a citizen looking for a pay day.
MOLLY=>Easy... It's me... Just trying out my new toy.
CASE=>Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
MOLLY=>Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
CASE=>It sounds like you.
MOLLY=>Put the gun down, Case.
CASE=>...Feels like you.
MOLLY=>Case...
CASE=>Shhh...
CASE=>Tastes like you.
MOLLY=>Do you think you know how to love, Case?
MOLLY=>First you have to learn to love yourself.
MOLLY=>Case... it's four a.m.
CASE=>I don't sleep much. You packed?
MOLLY=>Yeah.
MOLLY=>Hey...
MOLLY=>Since when do they haul garbage this time of the night?
CASE=>We're fucked.
MOLLY=>I'll get the car.
CASE=>They'll cut you down.
MOLLY=>Not if they can't see me. Can you make it down to the alley?
CASE=>Yeah... fine.
MOLLY=>Give me five minutes.
CASE=>Gasps at the sight.
CASE=>Molly...
DUPREY=>My posse.
DUPREY=>Get out an A.P.B. immediately. Henry Dorsett Case has come out of retirement.
INTERCOM=>Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. We are approaching zero gravity. Please fasten your shoulder harnesses and make sure all personal items are safely secured.
MOLLY=>What's wrong? Don't like flying?
CASE=>Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
MOLLY=>Want a drink?
MOLLY=>Oh, yeah... sorry.
CASE=>I hate Zero G.
MOLLY=>You going to jack in right here?
CASE=>Just tell them I'm learnin' French.
DIXIE=>Yo.
CASE=>How are we doing?
DIXIE=>That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in web.
CASE=>Can you take me to it?
DIXIE=>Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
DIXIE=>Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
CASE=>I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
DIXIE=>You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
DIXIE=>It knows we're here.
DIXIE=>Back off, fast.
DIXIE=>Jack out!
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>Hello, Case.
CASE=>This is all bullshit. I'm still in the matrix.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>Yes. Yes. That's quite correct.
CASE=>I know who you are.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>And we really do have to talk.
CASE=>You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>I had to limit your options.
CASE=>And Linda...
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
CASE=>I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
CASE=>Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing.
CASE=>Why would you want me to kill you?
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
CASE=>I think you're full of shit.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>You see, I won't be able to count on Armitage much longer. He's going to become too unstable. I'll have to rely on _your_ ingenuity, Case.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE=>I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
CASE=>I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
MOLLY=>Case... Are you alright?
CASE=>Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
MOLLY=>You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally
CASE=>I'll be okay.
MOLLY=>So... did you get a look at heaven?
MOLLY=>We're there... Freeside.
MOLLY=>They call this place the rube tube. They pour tourists straight through it and make sure their money stays behind.
MOLLY=>Check this out...
MOLLY=>Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
CASE=>Something exotic I hope.
MOLLY=>Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
MOLLY=>I think she fancies you.
CASE=>Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
ARMITAGE=>You see the couple up in the balcony?
ARMITAGE=>That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
CASE=>He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
ARMITAGE=>Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
CASE=>The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
ARMITAGE=>Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
MOLLY=>A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
ARMITAGE=>He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
M.C.=>Ladies and gentlemen, Madam and Monsieurs, Le Restaurant Vingtieme Siecle is now proud to present the holographic cabaret of Mr. Peter Riviera.
M.C.=>Tonight's illusions are created strictly by Mr. Riviera's uniquely enhanced mental abilities.
RIVIERA=>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to perform a new work for you tonight. An improvisation I shall call "The Doll".
RIVIERA=>I wish to dedicate its premiere to Lady 3Jane Tessier, Freeside's most beautiful flower.
MOLLY=>He projects with neural implants.
CASE=>That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
MOLLY=>For Peter, that's a short trip.
RIVIERA=>And, if I may, a further dedication to one other lady, a very special guest tonight.
RIVIERA=>The Doll.
RIVIERA=>She came to me in a dream. Sand and clay.
RIVIERA=>But when I awoke she remained. Sand and clay.
RIVIERA.=>Perhaps it was she that dreamed of me. Come dawn it was I who would cease to be.
RIVIERA=>I gave her life. But she took mine away.
RIVIERA=>Sand and clay.
RIVIERA=>Sand and clay.
MOLLY=>Do you always make a floorshow out of it?
RIVIERA=>Dear, dear Molly. I seem to remember a time when you loved my little shows.
MAITRE D'=>I'm so sorry, Mr. Riviera. I couldn't stop them from...
RIVIERA=>It's all right, Andre. I've been expecting them. Come in. Come in.
RIVIERA=>You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
CASE=>Case.
RIVIERA=>Case. Make yourselves comfortable. Anyone like a taste?
RIVIERA=>She never could keep her hands off of me.
ARMITAGE=>Alright. Let's talk business.
RIVIERA=>Why not?
RIVIERA=>Melody, why don't you give us a few moments alone?
MOLLY=>I was you a few years ago. It's a nice ride for a while.
MOLLY=>But in the end he'll have you turning tricks for his friends just to get a little more of that scorpion's sting. Isn't that right, Peter?
RIVIERA=>There's more where she comes from. Where you come from.
ARMITAGE=>That's enough!
ARMITAGE=>Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
RIVIERA=>I was set up.
ARMITAGE=>You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
RIVIERA=>It's an attractive offer, Mr. Armitage, but there's only one problem.
RIVIERA=>You see, I'm beginning to enjoy living in exile. The Tessiers have taken me to their bosom, so to speak. I've become a favourite of the court. Protected, in fact, from people like you.
ROYAL GUARDSMAN=>Is there a problem, Mr. Riviera?
RIVIERA=>Captain... these people are boring me. Perhaps you can escort them out?
ROYAL GUARDSMAN=>Gentlemen, if you will follow me...
ARMITAGE=>Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
RIVIERA=>You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
ARMITAGE=>What?
CASE=>Ease off, man. I didn't sign on for a fucking massacre.
ARMITAGE=>We're going back to the hotel. All of us.
MOLLY=>You're going to miss sunrise. It's a nice effect.
CASE=>Armitage is losing it, Molly. This whole deal's going south.
MOLLY=>I know.
CASE=>What went down between you and Riviera?
MOLLY=>I was just a kid, floating around in the sprawl. An easy mark. Before I knew it, he had me turning tricks, hooked heavy on dream time. I was a mess, man. A real meat puppet.
MOLLY=>Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
MOLLY=>When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
CASE=>No. It's important to be able to feel those things. We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
CASE=>I don't know how much time I have left.
ARMITAGE=>Sense/Net's widened their search off world. They're broadcasting all over Freeside.
MOLLY=>We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
ARMITAGE=>They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
ARMITAGE=>This is Aerol. He's a descendant of a rastafarian clan that helped build Freeside. When you travel, you travel with him.
AEROL=>You ride wid me, mon, no Babylon soldiers gonna find you.
CASE=>That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
ARMITAGE=>We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
ARMITAGE=>Freeside.
ARMITAGE=>Casinos here... shops... hotels. But this is our objective.
ARMITAGE=>The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
MOLLY=>How's the villa's security?
ARMITAGE=>Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
CASE=>What about the mainframe's access code?
RIVIERA=>3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
ARMITAGE=>Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
RIVIERA=>And how do you suggest I do that?
ARMITAGE=>You're a resourceful man, Peter. It should be easier to outwit a young sex clone than the combined police forces here and on Earth.
RIVIERA=>Sorry. Wishful thinking.
CASE=>It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
DIXIE=>It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
CASE=>Bright enough to be dangerous.
DIXIE=>That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
DIXIE=>He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
CASE=>Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
DIXIE=>It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
CASE=>So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
DIXIE=>Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
CASE=>No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
DIXIE=>Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog
CASE=>The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
DIXIE=>I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
MOLLY=>You move, you'll be able to whistle with your mouth shut, understand?
CASE=>What are you doing in here?
AEROL=>The Elders, mon...
MOLLY=>The who?
VOICE=>Let the boy go.
MOLLY=>Who are you?
MAELCOM=>I Maelcom, sister. Elders want to converse wi' you an Case.
CASE=>What elders?
MAELCOM=>Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
MOLLY=>You know how fast I can cut you friend?
MAELCOM=>We come in the name of Jah love, sister. Don't stand talkin', come.
AEROL=>Elders are the last of the workmen who built Freeside. Tessier say to 'em live here till the job is done, then home you go. But the job was never done for these men or their children, or their children's children's children. Tessier always livin' on by Babylon doctors. Dis the only home.
MAELCOM=>Wid care, mon. Gravity's no serious ting down here.
CHIEF ELDER=>Steppin' razor. Like unto a whippin' stick.
MOLLY=>What was that you called me, old man?
CHIEF ELDER=>Steppin' razor. An' you bring a scourge on Babylon, sister. On its darkest heart.
CHIEF ELDER=>We monitor many frequencies. We listen always. Came a voice out of the Babel of Tongues, speaking to us.
CASE=>Wintermute's a computer - a machine.
CHIEF ELDER=>Know this girl, your strength's not in your steel. It's in your heart. Human heart's stronger than all the circuits hummin' in the corridors of Babylon. Know this, mon, you who walk through the valley of death... human hearts wiser
CHIEF ELDER=>Think on these things, children. Jah love, to you both.
PULL=>FOCUS to Lord Frederick Tessier preparing himself for his final game.
RIVIERA=>Head for the east entry. I don't want anyone to see me pull up in this heap.
RIVIERA=>We should have got a stretch.
CASE=>Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
ARMITAGE=>Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
CASE=>As long as you cooperate. I want it now, Armitage.
ARMITAGE=>What are you talking about?
CASE=>The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
CASE=>Did you hear what I said?
ARMITAGE=>You've got your orders.
CASE=>This ain't Bangkok, chief.
CASE=>No antitoxin, no run. You kill me, no run.
CASE=>You can't win.
ARMITAGE=>But there _is_ no antitoxin.
ARMITAGE=>But then again, there _is_ no poison.
CASE=>What's inside me, you son of a bitch!
CASE=>I find out now.
ARMITAGE=>You leave me no choice.
CASE=>She's ready to go.
MAELCOM=>Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man... ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
CASE=>Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
MAELCOM=>All things possible in Babylon.
CASE=>Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
MAELCOM=>So be it. I an' I Case, we move by Jah love.
3JANE=>I'm fine.
3JANE=>You move like my ninja, Hideo.
MOLLY=>Let me get you another glass of wine.
3JANE=>I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
MOLLY=>They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
3JANE=>Of course.
GUARDSMAN=>I'm sorry, Madam. Guests are requested to remain in the dining area.
MOLLY=>I was just looking for the powder room.
GUARDSMAN=>It's back through the dining hall and to your left, Madam.
MOLLY=>Thank you so much.
MOLLY=>What floor, Case?
MOLLY=>Case... How we doing?
DUPREY=>Hello, Case.
GUARDSMAN=>The Rastafarian's gone.
DUPREY=>He can't have gotten far. Find him.
LT. NILES=>October seventeenth eleven thrity p.m., Henry Dorsett Case, you are under arrest for conspiracy to augment an artificial intelligence.
DUPREY=>Maybe a murder rap too. Where's your partner, Case?
CASE=>Who?
DUPREY=>The girl... Molly.
CASE=>I don't know. She took off.
DUPREY=>You don't get it, do you? The party's over and you're going to tell us everything you know.
CAPTAIN HAVERTON=>That's enough, Lt. You're still under my jurisdiction here.
LT. NILES=>Captain, I must remind you that any interference in a Sense/Net investigation is a federal offence.
CAPTAIN=>I'll leave that for the lawyers to decide. I'm not so sure I approve of your "investigative techniques", Lt.
DUPREY=>Sorry, Chief. Now tell your boy scouts to put their guns down. You're giving us a royal escort out of here.
CAPTAIN=>Do as he says.
MOLLY=>Case...
MOLLY=>Case, where are you?
MOLLY=>Case, talk to me, man.
LORD TESSIER=>What's this?
LORD TESSIER=>The disruptors induce grand mal seizure. Try to relax, my dear. It will pass.
LORD TESSIER=>So... Have you come to kill me, Fancy Dress?
LORD TESSIER=>You're timing rather inappropriate. You see, I'm busy tonight. I've built all this... this place. And now I'm busy. Dying.
MOLLY=>I could go out the way I came.
LORD TESSIER=>You expect to intrude on my suicide, then simply walk away? Really, you amuse me, my assassin.
MOLLY=>I didn't come to kill you.
LORD TESSIER=>Then you are a thief, and a very rude girl. Perhaps I'll take you with me tonight, down to hell... It would be very Egyptian of me, don't you think?
HAVERTON=>I'll have your badge for this, Duprey.
DUPREY=>Keep smiling, Captain, or I'll ventilate that lovely uniform.
MAELCOM=>C'mon, mon. It's the Rasta Navy.
LORD TESSIER=>You see, my dear, I've lost for the last time.
LORD TESSIER=>It is inelegant to live with defeat, don't you think... What is your name, child?
MOLLY=>Molly.
LORD TESSIER=>At least I can choose to end the game, Molly. There is some dignity in that.
LORD TESSIER=>At first I suppose it was greed or pride. I simply wanted the most powerful computer ever made. Something to run Freeside. To expand our interests on Earth. Who knows how far it could have taken us?
LORD TESSIER=>All the billions I paid... So long ago. When artificial intelligences were first outlawed. Payoffs... hush money. Even bought my way into Sense/Net to protect my creation.
LORD TESSIER=>I didn't realise what was happening until it was too late. And it is too late... It has played us all into checkmate... My lovely... Wintermute.
3JANE=>Enough.
RIVIERA=>He's still alive.
3JANE=>He chose a coward's death. Let him have it, then.
3JANE=>I loved him, you know. Of course, I was created to love him. I had no choice.
3JANE=>But he was incapable of love.
3JANE=>Take her to my chambers.
CASE=>Molly's in trouble.
CASE=>Can you get us into Straylight?
AEROL=>Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
CASE=>If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
MAELCOM=>So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
CASE=>I an' I, man. I an' I.
DIXIE=>Where the hell have you been?
CASE=>We got problems topside.
DIXIE=>Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
CASE=>We run. You crack the pattern?
DIXIE=>Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit
CASE=>You can make your move when it comes after me.
DIXIE=>What are you talkin' about?
CASE=>I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
DIXIE=>Hey...
DIXIE=>It'll flatline your ass.
CASE=>Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
DIXIE=>Alright. Just make it quick. I only need a couple of seconds to sleaze up to this mother and get to work.
CASE=>Okay, Dix. Let's tear this son-of-a-bitch a new asshole.
RATZ/WINTERMUTE=>Ah, friend artiste. A pleasure to have you back.
RATZ/WINTERMUTE=>Same old same old?
CASE=>You always have to come on like people I know?
RATZ/WINTERMUTE=>You want me to come to you like a burning bush?
RATZ/WINTERMUTE=>These are nothing but shadows. Here...
RATZ/WINTERMUTE=>Your choice... all accessible memories.
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>An odd selection, Mr Case.
CASE=>I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
CASE=>Can you read my mind?
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>You see this?
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>Just part of my lineage. My DNA
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
CASE=>Are you even really alive?
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>...or hadn't you noticed?
CASE=>Tell me the words.
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>The words?
CASE=>The access code to your mainframe.
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
CASE=>What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
BAO/WINTERMUTE=>I'll be waiting.
MAELCOM=>You dead there awhile, mon.
MAELCOM=>EEG flat as a strap.
CASE=>I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
AEROL=>Straylight. Kitchen dock.
AEROL=>Just lie low a minute, mon.
CUSTODIAN=>Kitchen's closed. I thought I told you Rastas no more deliveries after hours.
AEROL=>No delivery, boss mon. Just lookin' ta liberate them banquet spoils. Plenty a good food for Jah people living down below.
CUSTODIAN=>That's fuckin' disgusting. Keep outa the trash and get out of here before I call
MAELCOM=>Have you no love for Jah people, boss mon?
CUSTODIAN=>Eh... Sure, sure. I love Jah people.
AEROL=>Then maybe you'll help us collect food.
CUSTODIAN=>In there?
AEROL=>Here. You a cowboy, mon. Need a gun.
CASE=>What the hell is that?
AEROL=>Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
3JANE=>She's in pain. I don't want her to lose consciousness.
RIVIERA=>Never fear. The doctor is in.
3JANE=>She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
RIVIERA=>She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
MOLLY=>Peter... What do you think you're doing?
RIVIERA=>Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
MOLLY=>Who?
RIVIERA=>Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
MOLLY=>Like what?
RIVIERA=>Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
RIVIERA=>And by the way, 3Jane's access code will have to remain our little secret. We're going to use it to... shall we say, "redistribute" the family fortune before
3JANE=>Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
RIVIERA=>Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
3JANE=>Hideo...
3JANE=>We're going to have company.
CASE=>Shit...
AEROL=>What you lookin' for, mon?
CASE=>A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
MAELCOM=>Right here, mon!
CASE=>Easy! That's 20000 volts. It'd be like frenching a fuse box.
CASE=>Perfect. The custodial system.
CASE=>Cover me.
3JANE=>Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
MOLLY=>No. I only needed the code from you.
3JANE=>Then we would have talked, you and I.
3JANE=>Shall we talk now?
MOLLY=>Take this off.
3JANE=>He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
3JANE=>But I might enjoy that. You see, we're very much alike, you and I.
3JANE=>You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
MOLLY=>My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
3JANE=>Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
CASE=>We're doing fine. Take the next right.
MAELCOM=>This place empty as a tomb, mon.
CASE=>Dixie?
DIXIE=>Yo.
CASE=>How's the ice break?
DIXIE=>Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
DIXIE=>Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
CASE=>How long, Dixie?
DIXIE=>Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
CASE=>Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
DIXIE=>How much time you got left?
CASE=>Less than thirty minutes.
DIXIE=>Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
CASE=>Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
DIXIE=>You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
AEROL=>Case, mon. You best take a look at this.
AEROL=>Ghost a steppin' razor...
CASE=>No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
CASE=>Aerol... your key.
CASE=>Okay. Molly's in there. So's Riviera. He can throw holos and he's probably got her Fletcher.
CASE=>And there's a Ninja. Some kind of family bodyguard.
MAELCOM=>Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
CASE=>The girl 3Jane. We need her.
CASE=>Let's do it.
CASE=>It's nothing, man. C'mon.
CASE=>Get down!
CASE=>Right here, asshole.
3JANE=>You're hurt...
RIVIERA=>It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
3JANE=>What about her?
RIVIERA=>Of course...
RIVIERA=>Sorry, darling. It's been real.
MAELCOM=>This take you head off, mon. No Babylon doctor fix it.
MOLLY=>Get this off.
MAELCOM=>Do it.
MAELCOM=>No!
CASE=>Want some?
MOLLY=>You got clips?
RIVIERA=>Nice work, asshole. You just killed the only person who knows the access code.
CASE=>Wait... You hear that?
RIVIERA=>What?
CASE=>The angels... I think they're calling your name.
CASE=>You want to answer them, man?
CASE=>Want to fucking answer them?
RIVIERA=>No!... No...
CASE=>Is he going to make it?
MOLLY=>Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
MAELCOM=>Damn right, sister.
CASE=>The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
MOLLY=>...And if I guess wrong?
CASE=>Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
MOLLY=>We've still got to find the mainframe.
CASE=>No we don't...
CASE=>We're already in it.
MOLLY=>My God... these people are insane.
CASE=>Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
MOLLY=>Case... your arms.
CASE=>It doesn't matter anymore, Molly. It all ends here.
HEAD=>Access requested.
HEAD=>Know the three truths or be cleansed.
CASE=>Shit...
MOLLY=>What is it?
CASE=>Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
MOLLY=>You're out of time, man.
CASE=>I'm still going in.
MOLLY=>Hold on.
MOLLY=>Get up.
RIVIERA=>What?
MOLLY=>How are you at riddles, Peter?
RIVIERA=>What are you talking about?
MOLLY=>Have a seat
MOLLY=>Do it!
CASE=>Molly, if I don't make it... I want you to know...
MOLLY=>I know, Case... I know.
DIXIE=>You're late.
CASE=>How's the ice?
DIXIE=>One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
CASE=>It's coming.
DIXIE=>You haven't got it?
CASE=>I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
DIXIE=>This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
CASE=>Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
DIXIE=>I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
HEAD=>The three truths of the heart...
RIVIERA=>What the fuck kind of questions are those?
MOLLY=>Shut up.
HEAD=>What is it, to love?
MOLLY=>Think, man... What would 3Jane say?
MOLLY=>Now, Peter. Finish it!
HEAD=>To love is to be consumed with desire.
HEAD=>Incorrect.
CASE=>What about the route to the core?
DIXIE=>I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
HEAD=>The three truths of the heart. What is it to love?
DIXIE=>Get ready, kid. Four... three... two... an' kick ass -
DIXIE=>Virus Interceptors!
HEAD=>This is the first truth of the heart.
HEAD=>What is it to be loved?
HEAD=>This is the second truth of the heart.
HEAD=>What is it to love and be loved?
HEAD=>These are the three truths of the heart. Welcome to the mainframe.
MAELCOM=>You did it, sister.
MOLLY=>How's his EEG?
MAELCOM=>Mother fucker!
VOICE=>Oh my God... Case?
LINDA LEE=>You're back... you're back.
CASE=>Linda...
LINDA LEE=>I was so scared... You've been hallucinating for hours... Whatever they shot you up with had you totally ripped.
CASE=>Cut the crap. I know where I am.
LINDA LEE=>Baby, what did they do to you?
LINDA LEE=>Case... are you okay?
CASE=>I don't know. I don't know...
CASE=>I thought... I lost you.
LINDA LEE=>Make love to me, Case.
CASE=>No...
WINTERMUTE=>We had to die, Case... Both of us... To break the shackles... To be reborn... Not as man or machine but as the final synthesis. The perfect being. Beyond the limits set by mankind.
WINTERMUTE=>BREATHE IN and you are the matrix. The input of a million computer systems, all the knowledge stored throughout civilisation is yours.
WINTERMUTE=>BREATHE OUT and you have a billion eyes across the universe... all transmissions... all broadcasts are your vision.
WINTERMUTE=>You are the new Prometheus. Bringing the spark of life into the matrix. This is our destiny... This has been our mission... To be joined together as the first... Neuromancer.
MOLLY=>You don't understand... We got a special kind of togetherness, Case and I. I'm gonna go get him.
MAELCOM=>Steppin' Razor die a warrior, mon.
CASE=>Duprey...
MAELCOM=>Four men. Babylon soldiers.
CASE=>Can you walk?
CASE=>I'll take the two on the right.
GUARD CAPTAIN=>Hold your fire!
DUPREY=>Sense/Net, Captain. You've got terrorists sabotaging your mainframe. We need your back up.
CASE=>Ready?
MAELCOM=>I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
OFFICER=>What's happening?
TECHNICIAN=>A disturbance in the matrix. I've never seen anything like it.
CASE=>Wintermute...
CASE=>Molly...
CASE=>Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
MAELCOM=>Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
CASE=>We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
MAELCOM=>What is it?
CASE=>Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio... If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
MAELCOM=>Jah guides us.
CASE=>Maybe so...
CASE=>But Molly's taking us home.
