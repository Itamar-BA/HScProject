OLIVER=>Yes. "Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find Thee sitting careless on a granary floor, Thy hair soft lifted... Thy hair soft lifted..."
ALICE=>Reminds me. I have a date with the hairdresser.
OLIVER=>What a way to spend a Saturday afternoon!
ALICE=>The business girl's holiday
OLIVER=>You should've minded your mother and eaten more bread crusts. You'd have curly hair now.
ALICE=>Thank you for lunch. See you at the office Monday.
IRENA=>Thank you.
OLIVER=>You won't believe this, and you've probably heard it a dozen times before...but I've never known any artists.
IRENA=>I'm not an artist, really... not a real artist...just a sketch artist for fashion drawings.
OLIVER=>May I see it?
IRENA=>Oh, no. It's not good. If I let you see it, you might not want to know any artists...ever.
OLIVER=>I'm afraid it would have to be pretty bad to do that. Besides, look... "Let no one say, and say it to your shame..."
OLIVER=>Irena Dubrovna -- is that a Russian name?
IRENA=>No...I am from Serbia.
OLIVER=>I see. Would you mind spelling it?
IRENA=>You want to know how to spell my name? Are you going to write me a letter?
OLIVER=>I'd like to write you a letter.
IRENA=>What about?
OLIVER=>I would say in this letter... "Dear Miss...Dubrovna," I would say, "will you have tea with me?"
OLIVER=>Well, in that case, I'd just have to write you another letter, I'd say...
IRENA=>Here is my house.
IRENA=>Perhaps, Mr. Reed, you would like to have tea in my apartment.
OLIVER=>Oh, Miss Dubrovna, you make life so simple!
OLIVER=>I never cease to marvel at what lies behind a brownstone front.
OLIVER=>What's the matter?
IRENA=>Nothing.
OLIVER=>But you looked at me in such a funny way.
IRENA=>I've never had anyone here. You're the first friend I've met in America. I know lots of people in business...editors, secretaries, other sketch artists...you know. But you might be my first real friend. That's why I looked at you.
OLIVER=>Thank you.
IRENA=>That's Lalage.
OLIVER=>Lalage?
IRENA=>The perfume I use. I like it, perhaps too well. Maybe I use too much of it, living alone like this.
OLIVER=>Oh, I like it all right. It's hard to describe...not like flowers...it's like something warm and living.
OLIVER=>What's that?
IRENA=>It's the lions in the zoo. One can hear them here often. Many people in this building complain. The roaring keeps them awake.
OLIVER=>And you don't mind it?
IRENA=>No. To me it's the way the sound of the sea is to others, natural and soothing. I like it.
OLIVER=>Not exactly. Who's it supposed to be?
IRENA=>King John.
OLIVER=>King John? The Magna Carta and stuff?
IRENA=>Oh, no. King John of Serbia. He was a fine king. He drove the Mamelukes out of Serbia and freed the people.
OLIVER=>But why have this around?
IRENA=>Perhaps you have in your room a picture of George Washington or Abraham Lincoln?
OLIVER=>Aren't there some better statues of him -- some without that cat thing?
IRENA=>Yes. There are beautiful statues of King John. There is one in Belgrade, where his face shines with goodness. But this statue reminds me of my home, the little village where I was born. This is the statue that stands in the square.
OLIVER=>But what does it mean? Why is he spearing that cat?
IRENA=>It's not really a cat. It's meant to represent the evil ways into which my village once had fallen. You see, the Mamelukes came to Serbia long, long ago, and they made the people slaves. But my village was too little, too far away in the mountains. They left it alone. For five hundred years my little village was cut off from the Mother Church. At first the people were good and worshipped God in a true Christian way. But, little by little, the people changed. When King John drove out the Mamelukes and came to our village he found dreadful things. The people bowed down to Satan and said their Masses to him. They had become witches and were evil. King John put some of them to the sword and burned some of them in fires. But some --the wisest and the most wicked -- escaped into the mountains. ) Now, do you understand?
OLIVER=>I still don't see what it has to do with you.
IRENA=>Those who escaped — the wicked ones -- their legend haunts the village where I was born. The past remains...
OLIVER=>Boys who come to tea can't expect to stay to dinner.
OLIVER=>When am I going to see you again? Tomorrow?
ALICE=>A little more to the left, Harry. Easy...just a hair...
COMMODORE=>By George! This is going to bo our best yet. Wait till she rides into Tokyo Bay.
ALICE=>She's got what it takes all right, Commodore.
OLIVER=>Bought it.
COMMODORE=>You're not going to start keeping cats, are you?
OLIVER=>No, Commodore, I just got it for a friend.
CARVER=>We arrive at the inescapable conclusion that our Oliver has a girl.
COMMODORE=>A brilliant deduction.
ALICE=>A girl friend?
OLIVER=>A girl.
ALICE=>Anybody I know?
OLIVER=>Not yet, but I know you'll like her.
ALICE=>If you like her, she's okay with me.
OLIVER=>Look, Irena. I brought you a present.
IRENA=>It's all right. It's just that cats don't seem to like me.
OLIVER=>But this is only a kitten. It's very friendly. When I had it in the office, Alice — the girl who works in our department — it played with her.
IRENA=>Cats just don't like me.
OLIVER=>Yes.
IRENA=>Good. We could exchange it for some other pet?
MISS PLUNKETT=>I can't imagine...
OLIVER=>All I want is to exchange this kitten for a bird.
MISS PLUNKETT=>Why, of course. I have some lovely canaries. One little lemon-colored follow with top notes like Caruso.
IRENA=>You go, please, Oliver. Pick the one you like. It's so hot and stifling in there. I'd rather stay here.
OLIVER=>Of course. I'll only bo a minute.
MISS PLUNKETT=>Animals are ever so psychic. There are some people who just can't come in hero. My dear brother's wife, for instance; she's a very nice girl...I've nothing against her...but you should just see what happens when she puts her foot inside this place. The cats particularly. They seem to know. You can fool everybody, but landie, dearie me, you can't fool a cat. In some ways they seem to know who's not right — if you know what I mean. Here we are! Isn't he a ducky little angel!
OLIVER=>This is it.
OLIVER=>What do you think of it?
IRENA=>Ah, he is sweet! He will like me very much. You will see. I like to be liked.
OLIVER=>That ought to be easy. Really easy.
OLIVER=>Slide rule.
ALICE=>I have to wash the taste of that out of my mouth.
CARVER=>What's that?
ALICE=>I'll bet you a dollar you can't hold a quarter on your forehead like this, pull out your belt, lower your head, and let the quarter fall bingo into your trousers.
CARVER=>A mere matter of precision.
COMMODORE=>Who wants to go out on my boat Sunday?
OLIVER=>The fact is, sir, I've got an engagement for Sunday.
ALICE=>Your boat seems to have competition, Commodore.
CARVER=>You should meet the competition.
ALICE=>Have you met her, Doc?
CARVER=>I saw her one day with Ollie.
ALICE=>Ollie's always saying he'll take me to see her, but he never does.
OLIVER=>As a matter of fact, Alice, I was going to take you around next Sunday, but since the Commodore...
COMMODORE=>I withdraw my invitation to you two.
ALICE=>We'll take a rain check, Commodore,
COMMODORE=>I'll expect the rest of you.
IRENA=>I think, Alice, I shall like you very much. We shall be good friends, you and I.
ALICE=>Ollie tells me you like to draw cats. I tried to draw a cat once -- looked more like a mouse.
IRENA=>Cats are harder to draw than the human hand...a good cat portrait is almost impossible. Look up there... Even Goya couldn't do it...not really well. That's why I like It...because it's hard.'
ALICE=>Because it's hard? You're a glutton for punishment.
IRENA=>No, it's not just because it's hard. In a way, I felt I had to draw them. Didn't you draw boats?
ALICE=>Sure. I spent half my study periods drawing boats. The Marblehead tomboy — that was me.. My poor mother wept every time I brought home a report card.
IRENA=>And I drew cats. The other children in my village had cats, and they could hug them and play with them. But cats don't like me. They won't let me cuddle or caress them. So instead of playing with them, I drew them. They're the one subject still too hard for me. You understand, don't you?
OLIVER=>I think it's right clever. How about my mixing a cocktail?
IRENA=>I have them all mixed.
OLIVER=>This is what the kitten turned into.
ALICE=>Much easier for a working girl to keep. Listen to her, will you? Little old Jenny Lind herself.
IRENA'S VOICE=>Was the bird singing?
ALICE=>Yes. It gave out with an aria.
IRENA=>It's never sung before. This is the first time.
ALICE=>Probably a prima donna.
IRENA=>Shall we have our martinis?
OLIVER=>Here's luck to all of us...May we always be in better voice than that.
ALICE=>To all of us.
IRENA=>Better now?
OLIVER=>Much better. Those under-lit tables we work at...we had to use them all day today... they give a man a rotten headache.
IRENA=>What about Alice? Doesn't she mind them?
OLIVER=>I suppose so, but she never lets anything bother her. She says the best cure for anything is swimming. She only lives at that women's club because there's a pool there.
OLIVER=>Irena
IRENA=>Yes.
OLIVER=>I've been asleep.
IRENA=>I know.
OLIVER=>It couldn't have been very entertaining for you.
IRENA=>I was watching you.
OLIVER=>And that was fun?
IRENA=>Why?
OLIVER=>When people in America know each other as well as we do — when they're in love — or oven think they're in love, they've usually kissed long ago.
IRENA=>I love you, Oliver.
OLIVER=>For heaven's sake, Irena, what's wrong?
IRENA=>I've lived in dread of this moment, Oliver. I've not wanted to love you. I kept myself away from people...I stayed alone...I never wanted this to happen.
OLIVER=>But you just told me you loved me.
IRENA=>I do. I do.
OLIVER=>Then there's only one thing to do. Come up here and be kissed.
IRENA=>No. I can't, Oliver, I've fled from the past, from things you could never know or understand...evil things... evil...
OLIVER=>Irena, you've told me something of the past...of King John, and the witches in the village, and the cat people who are descended from them. Fairy tales, Irena, fairy tales you heard in childhood...nothing more than that. They've nothing to do with you, really. You're Irena...you're here In America...you're so normal you're even in love with me...Oliver Reed...a good, plain Americano.
CARVER=>Ah! Comitaji!
IRENA=>Oh, Mr. Carver, you should not call the good man that.
CARVER=>But it's Serbian. I got it from my barber this afternoon.
IRENA=>You might insult him. "Comitaji" means bandit...robber...
CARVER=>Bless my soul!
COMMODORE=>Oliver's bride seems a very nice girl...and very pretty too. Carver tells me she's a bit odd. He's a little worried about the marriage.
ALICE=>Nonsense. Irena's a grand gir1. She and Oliver are going to be very happy together.
COMMODORE=>To the bride.
CARVER=>Looks like a cat.
IRENA=>Thank you so much, Alice, for this lovely party. I did not know there was a Serbian restaurant.
ALICE=>Anything you want to know about this city, ask me. I know all the unimportant details.
CAT WOMAN=>Moja sestra.
ALICE=>How do you like that?
OLIVER=>What did that woman say to you?
IRENA=>If this were any night but-my wedding night...If you were any man but my husband...I would not tell you.
OLIVER=>Wait a minute. It can't be that serious...just one single word --
IRENA=>She greeted me...she called me "sister." You saw her, Oliver. You saw what she looked like.
OLIVER=>Oh, the cat people ... she's one of the cat people. She looks like a cat, and so she must be one of the cat people...one of King John's pets. Irena, you crazy kid!
CARVER=>I know a joke about weddings. Why would my wedding be a dollar and cents wedding?
COMMODORE=>All right -- why?
CARVER=>Because I haven't d dollar, and my girl hasn't any sense.
COMMODORE=>Come along, Carver.
OLIVER=>What is it, darling?
IRENA=>I'm going to beg --
OLIVER=>Mrs. Reed.
IRENA=>It's nice to hear that...nice. I want to be Mrs.. Reed.
OLIVER=>You are, Irena.
IRENA=>But I want to be Mrs. Reed really. I want to be everything that name means to me — -- and I can't -- I can't.
OLIVER=>There's no sense in what you're saying, darling. You're excited. That woman in the restaurant upset you.
IRENA=>She brought back the old fears. If I could have some time to -- Oliver, be kind -- be patient - let me have time - time to get over this feeling there's something evil in me.
OLIVER=>Darling, you can have all the time there is In the world, If you want it, and all the patience and the kindness there's in me. You didn't have to ask for that.
IRENA=>Only a little time...only a little time, Oliver. I don't want more than that!
OLIVER=>Good night, Irena,
IRENA=>Good night, Oliver..
OLIVER'S VOICE=>Good night, Irena.
KEEPER=>There was not any person hurt, Except the Reverend Parson Burt... He wasn't killed by cannon ball, As judged by jurors one and all.
IRENA=>I've been married. I've been married almost a month.
KEEPER=>That's what I tell this misbegotten devil...nobody comes to see him when they're happy. The monkey house and the aviary draw the happy customers.
IRENA=>But he's beautiful.
KEEPER=>No. He ain't beautiful. He's an evil creature, ma'am. You read your Bible. In Revelations -- when the Book is talking about the worst beast of them all -- it says, "And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard."
IRENA=>Like unto a leopard...
KEEPER=>Yes, ma'am, like a leopard... but not a leopard. I guess that fits this fellow.
IRENA=>Yes, it fits him.
KEEPER=>Best wishes for your marriage, ma' am.
OLIVER=>Would you like some sherry?
IRENA=>It's not just because the bird died.
OLIVER=>They can't match your little finger.
IRENA=>I envy them. They are happy. They make their husbands happy. They lead normal, happy lives. They're free... The bird...do you know what happened to the bird?
OLIVER=>It died.
IRENA=>It died of fright when I tried to take it In my hand.
OLIVER=>All right. The bird was afraid of you -- that's nothing. I had a rabbit once that hated me; yet I grew up to be quite a nice fellow.
IRENA=>Oliver, when I went past the panther's cage I had to open the box; I had to throw the bird to him, Do you understand?...I had to. I had to do it! That's what frightens me.
OLIVER=>I've been trying to kid you out of it. Maybe that's wrong. I've tried...
IRENA=>No one could have been more gentle or more patient.
OLIVER=>I've tried to make you realize all these stories that worry you are so much nonsense. Now I see it's not the stories... it's the fact that you believe them. We've got to have help, Irena.
IRENA=>Find one for me, Oliver. The best one...the very best one I
JUDD=>the cats...the cats...you were saying the cats....the cats...
IRENA=>They torment me. I wake in the night, I fool their warmth and their strength in me...in me. I walk in the day, and the tread of their foot whispers in my brain. I have no peace...for they are in me...
JUDD=>In me... in me...
IRENA=>No...not very.
JUDD=>Hypnosis always tires me. And some of my patients, too, find it exhausting.
IRENA=>It's only that I remember nothing.
JUDD=>But It 1s my duty to remember, I have it all here. Most Interesting. You told me of your village, and the people, and their strange beliefs.
IRENA=>Is that all I told you?
JUDD=>You told me tales of blood, violence...mangled bodies in dark forests...men torn to death by woman half witch, half panther.
IRENA=>I am so ashamed. It must seem so childish.
JUDD=>And the cat woman of your village...you told me of them, too...woman who In jealousy or anger, or out of their own corrupt passions, could change into great cats, like panthers. And if one of those woman were to fall in love...and if her lover were to kiss her...take her into his embrace, she would be driven by her own evil to kill him.
IRENA=>What shall I tell my husband? Naturally, he is anxious to have some word.
JUDD=>What does one tell a husband? One tells him nothing.
JUDD=>Friday, at eleven?
IRENA=>Alice, it's so nice to see you!
ALICE=>Hello, darling. How did you make out with Louis?
IRENA=>Louis ?
ALICE=>Dr. Judd.
OLIVER=>Alice knows, darling.
ALICE=>Of course. Didn't I suggest Dr. Judd? I met him on the Commodore's boat. The way he goes around kissing hands makes me want to spit cotton, but I guess he knows all there is to know about psychiatry.
OLIVER=>I told Alice; I knew she'd know some good doctor.
IRENA=>I don't see why that was necessary.
ALICE=>Sorry. I seem to have put my big foot in it.
IRENA=>Good-bye, Alice.
OLIVER=>Darling, really, there's no reason....
IRENA=>But, Oliver, how can you discuss such things...such intimate things about me? How much did you tell her?
OLIVER=>You can tell Alice anything. She's such a good egg, she can understand anything.
IRENA=>There are some things a woman doesn't want other women to understand.
OLIVER=>I woke up. You were gone, What's wrong, darling?
IRENA=>I couldn't sleep. I went out.
OLIVER=>Where'd you go?
IRENA=>Just walked.
OLIVER=>I'm sorry about this afternoon. I just didn't think.
IRENA=>We should never quarrel, Oliver. I need you so much. You must help me, Oliver. Never let me feel jealousy or anger. Whatever it is that is In me is held in...is kept harmless...when I am happy.
OLIVER=>I'd turn handsprings, darling... I'd dance In the streets...to make you happy.
IRENA=>You forgot your key.
KEEPER=>Ah, I'm always forgettin' it, 'Tain't no worry in It. Nobody'd steal one of them creatures.
JUDD=>You resist temptation admirably.
IRENA=>Temptation?
JUDD=>The key.
IRENA=>Why would I want it?
JUDD=>For many reasons. There is, in some cases, a psychic need to loose evil upon the world. And we all of us carry within us a desire for death. You fear the panther; yet you are drawn to him again and again. Could you not turn to him as an instrument of death? You didn't come back to see me Friday. I've had to come to you.
IRENA=>How did you know where to find me?
JUDD=>You told me many things.
IRENA=>I don't feel that you can help me. You are very wise. You know a great deal. Yet when you speak of the soul, you mean the mind...and it is not my mind that is troubled.
JUDD=>What a clever girl! All the psychologists, all the theologians have tried for centuries to find that subtle shade of difference between mind and soul...and you have found it!
IRENA=>It does seem presumptuous of me, doesn't it? Good-bye, Doctor.
JUDD'S VOICE=>I can cut one thread of fear for you.
JUDD=>Your mother. Do you remember her?
IRENA=>Yes. My mother was a peasant. She was lovely...quiet and strong...a big woman.
JUDD=>And this aristocratic little hand...is this a peasant hand? The little bones of this wrist...are they peasant bones? The mystery of your father is very simple. Perhaps a young aristocrat from Belgrade... maybe an artist on a sketching trip. And your mother..fresh and attractive, as peasant girls are when they are young.
IRENA=>But what of my mother's death?
JUDD=>Her death? You didn't tell me.
IRENA=>I held her hand when she died. That hand...even as I held it... turned to the black paw of a panther. I felt the coarse hair, the sharp talons, the pads...I felt them... I saw her lying, black... I saw that.
JUDD=>You were a child?
IRENA=>I was thirteen when my mother died.
JUDD=>Why did she die?
IRENA=>There was an epidemic in the village.
JUDD=>And you were sick, feverish, delirious, when your mother died?
IRENA=>No. I was called from school. I can remember it so clearly. I came through the fields. The meadow larks were singing, and the sun was shining. I carried the knapsack of school books in my hand. I remember I could not believe that on such a day anyone could die. I was not delirious.
JUDD=>There is a delirium in great grief. There are the illusions of bereavement.
IRENA=>The priest would not come into our house when he saw what was on the bed. Was his also an illusion of grief?
JUDD=>There is always an explanation for every phenomenon. We shall find the reasonable explanation for this one.
OLIVER=>Toward the sheer line...sixty-two degrees --
ALICE=>Hey!
OLIVER=>I'm sorry. Must have given you the wrong figure. Let me try again.
ALICE=>Wait. Let's have a cigarette first.
OLIVER=>Getting careless in my old ago.
ALICE=>Something's on your mind. Anything wrong?
OLIVER=>No.
ALICE=>Must be marriage.
OLIVER=>In a way, it is. I'm worried about Irena.
ALICE=>I thought she was going to Dr. Judd.
OLIVER=>That's what I thought. But I bumped Into Judd this morning, and she hasn't been there since the first visit.
ALICE=>But you told me she seemed anxious to be cured.
OLIVER=>Apparently not.
ALICE=>I'm sorry, Oliver. It must make you very unhappy.
OLIVER=>You know...it's a funny thing... I've never been unhappy before. Things have always gone swell for me. I had a grand time as a kid...lots of fun at school... at the office here with you, and the Commodore, and Doc. That's why I don't know what to do about all this. I've just never been unhappy.
ALICE=>I can't help it. I just can't help it. I can't bear to see you unhappy. I love you too darn much, and I don't care if you do know it. I love you.
OLIVER=>I didn't' know it.
ALICE=>Of course, you didn't. What do you think I'd do...drag my blooding heart across the drafting tables? It just had to come out now. It's been too hard to love you...to see you in love with Irena...and to see you unhappy.
OLIVER=>I don't know. All this trouble has made me think -- I don't know what love really is. I don't oven know whether I'm in love with Irena.
ALICE=>I know what love is. It's understanding. It's you and me...and let the rest of the world go by. It's just the two of us, living our lives together..happily...proudly. No self-torture...no doubt. It's enduring and it's everlasting. Nothing can change it. Nothing can change us. That's what I think love is.
OLIVER=>I don't feel that way about Irena. It's a different feeling. I'm drawn to her. There's a warmth from her that pulls at me...I have to watch her when she's in the room. I have to touch her when she's near. But I don't really know her. In many ways were strangers.
ALICE=>You and I...we'11 never be strangers.
OLIVER=>Irena.
IRENA=>I love you, Oliver.
OLIVER=>I know -- but people can love, and people can still drift apart. And that's what I feel is happening to us. We don't talk together openly — you are not frank with me...
IRENA=>I have never lied to you.
OLIVER=>I ran into Dr. Judd today.
IRENA=>He cannot help me.
OLIVER=>You won't lot him help you. You won't let me help you. You won't even help yourself. It's what I said to Alice this afternoon —
IRENA=>Alice!
OLIVER=>I promised you we'd never quarrel. Let's calm down a bit. I'll go down to the office — I've got some work to do.
MRS. AGNEW=>You want to go up to the office, Mr. Reed?
OLIVER=>No, I think I'll go around the corner to Sally Lunn's and get a cup of coffee before I got to work. I'll be back.
MINNIE=>Maybe you'd like some nice chicken gumbo, Mr. Reed.
OLIVER=>No, thanks, Minnie. How about some apple pie and a cup of coffee?
MINNIE=>Yes'r, Mr. Reed. My goodness, don't nobody like chicken gumbo?
ALICE=>Hello. Hello.
ALICE'S VOICE=>Hello -- Hello —
ALICE=>John Paul Jones, don't you hate people who do that?
ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING=>:fI*bm^;:VohlMv;th6?ae^h^1M'V/¦::,iV^ cat in line; a little further to one side than the other. From this vantage point we can see down into Irena's apartment. We now see the object of Irena's adoration and her plea: the statue of King John of Serbia. Suddenly, Irena rises swiftly to her feet, and with a quick, violent movement she sweeps the statue to the floor. The cats, frightened, scamper away over the rooftops.
ALICE=>Here, Mrs. Agnew, I've got a couple of new match books for your collection.
MRS. AGNEW=>Thanks, Miss Moore. Chartreuse. My, ain't that elegant!
ALICE=>Oh? Where'd he go?
MRS. AGNEW=>Said he was going around the corner to Sally Lunn's.
ALICE=>I'll see if I can catch him, Good night.
MRS. AGNEW=>Good night, Miss Moore.
ALICE=>Could you squeeze the coffee pot for me, Minnie?
OLIVER=>Hello !
MINNIE=>I sure could. Only this coffee's been workin' so long, it's got muscles.
ALICE=>What are you doing in this part of town at this hour of night?
ALICE=>Ollie, you're going to have to solve your problems your own way. I'm going to drink up and go home. You'd better go home, too, and make it up with Irena.
OLIVER=>You're very swell.
ALICE=>That's what makes me dangerous. I'm the new type of other woman.
OLIVER=>Cold?
ALICE=>A cat just walked over my grave.
OLIVER=>Don't you want me to walk you home?
ALICE=>I'm a big girl now, and I'm not afraid.
OLIVER=>Well, good night.
ALICE=>Good night.
BUS DRIVER=>Are you ridin' with me, or ain'tcha?
BUS DRIVER=>You look as if you'd seen a ghost.
ALICE=>Did you see it?
POLICEMAN=>What got into you, Joe?
CARETAKER=>The woolly fools!
TAXI DRIVER=>Taxi?
OLIVER=>Are you all right?
IRENA=>Please...please...don't touch me...don't come near me.
OLIVER=>All right.
IRENA=>I forgive you.
OLIVER=>Irena? Irena?
IRENA'S VOICE=>What do you want?
JUDD'S VOICE=>Go loose evil upon the world -- a psychic necessity — a desire for death-- to loose evil --a desire for death -- to loose evil — a desire for death ---
KEEPER=>Good afternoon, ma'am.
IRENA=>The animals must love you. You feed them so promptly...the same time every day. One could set one's watch by you.
KEEPER=>Thank you, ma'am. It ain't that the animals like me, though. I tell you, they'd just as leave have me for their dinner, even if they was to get everlastin1 dyspepsia.
IRENA=>I don't think they'd find you indigestible.
ALICE=>I'm afraid this is dull for Irena.
OLIVER=>Look, darling, there are some beautiful moderns upstairs. Why don't you take a look at them?
IRENA=>I like these little boats. I want to be with you. Don't send me away.
OLIVER=>We're not sending you away. We just don't want you to be bored.
ALICE=>Ollie, look! Line drawings of the "America!"
ALICE=>Could I have the key to the swimming pool? .
BLONDE=>Of course, dearie.
ALICE=>What a darling kitten!
BLONDE=>Yeah. It's one of four. Minou had 'em about a month ago.
ALICE=>I won't forget!
BLONDE=>Hullo...Ah, gee -- I can't tonight. I got Civilian Defense work...Yeah. As I was saying to Brenda, them Japs and Nazis is whittling down my social life.
BLONDE=>Just a minute, dearie. Yes?
IRENA=>Is Miss Moore in?
BLONDE=>She just went downstairs to the swimming pool.
IRENA=>Would it be all right if I went down to see her?
BLONDE=>Of course, dearie. Right down them steps there.
BLONDE=>Mrs. Hanson! Mrs. Hanson!
MRS, HANSON=>P3r barmhertighetens skull... Kom med skynda.
IRENA=>What Is the matter, Alice?
MRS. HANSON=>Vad fattas, Miss Moore...
BLONDE=>Gee whiz, dearie, you all right?
ALICE=>It's nothing. It was dark down here. Mrs. Reed, coming in unexpectedly, frightened me. I'm terribly sorry.
MRS. HANSON=>Jag ar glad att allt &r v&lbestSlt med er.
ALICE=>Don't go. I'm coming right out.
IRENA=>I'm sorry I disturbed you, Alice. I missed you and Oliver. I thought you might know where he is.
ALICE=>We looked for you at the museum, You'll probably find him at home.
IRENA=>If you don't mind, then, I'll run on.
ALICE=>Would you get me my robe? I left It over there.
BLONDE=>Why, honey, it's torn to ribbons!
ALICE=>Thank you for coming at so late an hour, Dr. Judd. I phoned you because I am troubled. I think you can help me. How much do you believe about the cat people?
JUDD=>The cat people? The story Mrs. Reed told me?
ALICE=>What would you say, Dr. if I were to tell you that believe Irena's story?
JUDD=>Yes?
ALICE=>Twice I have been followed by something that was not human, something that attempted to take my life. I believe that was the cat form of Irena.
JUDD=>Why should she wish to harm you?
ALICE=>Because I am in love with her husband.-
JUDD=>Oh, my dear Miss Moore, the story grows more and more charming. And simpler all the time, too. You are both victim of fear. Mrs. Reed fears the past and you fear the present. Mrs. Reed has a very strong imagination, and you have an equally strong conscience.
ALICE=>I am not a victim of fear, Dr. Judd. The danger that threatened me was very real.
JUDD=>You disappoint me, Miss Moore.
ALICE=>Here is my robe.
JUDD=>To understand this, I would first have to hear Mrs. Reed's version of the story myself. That should be a most interesting interview*
ALICE=>I shouldn't advise you to see her alone.
JUDD=>Do you think I am afraid of so charming a lady?
ALICE=>I know you don't believe me, Doctor but you must be careful.
JUDD=>You want me to carry some means of protection — a gun, perhaps, with a silver bullet...is that what you mean?
ALICE=>) If you're lucky enough to have one.
JUDD=>Of course, this isn't silver...
IRENA=>Hello. ) Alice?
ALICE=>I didn't sleep last night, Irena.
IRENA'S VOICE=>Oh, darling...
ALICE=>You hate me, Irena, don't you? You hate me so much that twice you have tried to kill me, haven't you? That night on the Transverse... again last night in the swimming pool...that was you, wasn't it?
IRENA=>Don't say that, I don't remember last night. I don't remember. It isn't true. You mustn't say it!
ALICE=>I am sorry, Irena.
IRENA'S VOICE=>Help me...help me...
JUDD=>You say you have lapses of memory for which you cannot account...they are becoming more frequent...and you are afraid...
IRENA=>Help me...
JUDD=>I cannot help you. You are not truthful with me.
IRENA=>But I am. I have told you everything. I have not lied.
JUDD=>Do you sincerely believe that if your husband were to kiss you, you would change into a cat and rend him to bits?
IRENA=>I don't know...I am only afraid...
JUDD=>And if I were to kiss you?
IRENA=>I don't know, I only know that I should not like to be kissed by you.
JUDD=>My dear Mrs. Reed, sometimes, in my profession, there comes a contest of will between the doctor and his patient. The patients are clever...oh, very clever...and they can fool the doctor...sometimes. You are very clever and, perhaps you enjoy this little game you are having with me. But, in the end, I will discover your secret.
IRENA=>Dr. Judd, believe me...I beg you to believe,me. I have no secrets. I have told you everything. I have not lied to you. I need your help.
JUDD=>I cannot help you when you refuse to confide in me. But I can warn you. These hallucinations approach insanity — this nonsense about Miss Moore- in the park and at the swimming pool — it is a deterioration of the mind — the escape into fantasy — and it is dangerous —
IRENA=>For the first time you have been kind to me.
JUDD=>It is because you interest me.
IRENA=>Oliver?
OLIVER=>Listen, Irena -- I had hoped - things have changed.
IRENA=>Too late ---
OLIVER=>It's no one's fault...neither yours, nor mine. I'm sorry we've caused each other unhappiness...
IRENA=>You gave me happiness.
OLIVER=>There seems only one decent thing for me to do -- I'll give you a divorce. Believe me, it is better this way.
IRENA=>Better? Better for whom? I am being loft alone.
OLIVER=>Irena — you're talking, like an insane woman.
IRENA=>Please --- please go.
OLIVER=>Dr. Louis Judd, please.
MINNIE=>Bavarian cream?
JUDD=>I have pointed out two alternatives, Mr. Reed. Either have her put away for observation and restraint or have your marriage annulled.
ALICE=>It's tough for Oliver either way, Doctor.
JUDD=>As a psychiatrist I should recommend that you have her put away.
ALICE=>And if Irena is sent away?
JUDD=>The law is very explicit. One cannot divorce an insane person.
OLIVER=>If she's not well, I am going to take care of her.
ALICE=>It's the only right thing.
JUDD=>As you will. I shall have the commitment papers drawn up and arrange an interview with Mrs. Reed tonight at her apartment. Let's say 6 o'clock?
OLIVER=>Let's not play that. I don't think Irena's coming. We've waited an hour and a half. I don't think she Intends to come. She's probably walking in the park.
JUDD=>Perhaps it Is useless to wait.
ALICE=>Let's get back to the office, Ollie. We've had a terribly broken~up day. There's lots of work to be done.
OLIVER=>Suits me.
JUDD=>How stupid! I left my walking stick in the apartment.
OLIVER=>I'll get it for you.
JUDD=>No, no. It is my fault. Give me the key. I shall only be a moment.
JUDD=>Thank you so much. I should be quite lost without my walking stick.
ALICE=>Don't worry, Ollie. It'll come out all right. It must.
OLIVER=>Let's get to work.
ALICE=>Three and a quarter...
OLIVER=>And one and three eighths!
ALICE=>And one and three eighths! There!
OLIVER=>What?
ALICE=>It happened once before like that. The telephone rang. I answered. There was someone on the other end of the line; I could almost hear them listening. And then there was a little click, as they put up the receiver. That was the night I was followed on the transverse... Oliver...
OLIVER=>What is it, Alice?
ALICE=>Let's get out of here, I'm afraid.
OLIVER=>Your things.
ALICE=>The door's open. We can see to get out into the hall.
OLIVER=>I'll switch off the table lights as we go.
ALICE=>It's shut now. Just a minute ago it was open.
OLIVER=>It's locked.
OLIVER=>Don't Alice. It's gone. Everything's all right. Don't be afraid.
ALICE=>I'm not afraid.
OLIVER=>Look!
ALICE=>Irena's perfume -- strong — sweet...
ALICE=>I've got to have a drink.
JUDD=>Yes?
ALICE'S VOICE=>Dr. Judd?
ALICE=>Yes. We've been trying to get you on the phone, Dr. Judd. I called your hotel. Yes. I know. That's what I want to talk about. Are you alone? You had better leave then. She may be on her way back now, She is dangerous, Dr. Judd. I warn you — Hello. Hello. Dr. Judd. Dr. Judd are you there?
OLIVER=>We'll get a taxi!
JUDD=>I kept my appointment, late, aren't you?
IRENA=>Oliver!
FIRST OLD LADY'S VOICE=>Mr. Reed! Oh, Mr. Reed!
FIRST OLD LADY=>You needn't worry, Mr. Reed, Sue Ellen and I phoned the police Just as soon as we heard the racket.
OLIVER=>Thank you.
FIRST OLD LADY=>Sue-Ellen! You know better than that. You're not supposed to touch anything until the police get here.
SUE-ELLEN=>But it's all blood.
ALICE=>We've got to help her.
OLIVER=>She never lied to us.
ALICE=>Come on.
OLIVER=>Poor Irena.
