A GIANT BALLROOM=>As a hundred heads turn towards her. While the room is packed with people, it’s dead silent. They’ve been waiting. For her. And now we hear one sound: THE WHIR OF CAMERAS. A DOZEN PHOTOGRAPHERS gathered at the entrance snap her picture. The crowd parts to reveal A TABLE at the very center of the room. A CHESSBOARD sits on top. TV CAMERAS have been set up. The size/look hinting that it’s sometime in the mid sixties. Seated at the table waiting for her is VASILY BORGOV, forty. A frightening figure in a dark suit, Borgov is all eyebrows and frown. Beth approaches, quickly shakes his hand and sits down across from him.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>I know that, at this moment, all you’re feeling is loss. But after grief brings you low, prayer and faith will lift you high... high enough for you to see a new path for yourself.
BETH=>What are they?
JOLENE=>Well, someday you might. You let me know if you do.
ON THE WINDOW=>As Beth gets to the front of the line and Fergussen hands her the two pills and a cup of water. Beth looks at them...
AS BETH SITS DOWN=>Jolene takes one look at Beth’s dreamy face and laughs.
JOLENE=>Far as we know.
DOWN THE HALL.=>She looks up at the ceiling. BRANCHES from the trees outside the window form eerie, CRISSCROSSING SHADOWS on the ceiling. She sees Jolene, a few beds over, taking her pill NOW. Jolene looks back at Beth, shakes her head and lays down. Beth rolls over on her side and curls up tight. INT. GIRLS' WARD - MORNING As Beth wakes up, doesn’t feel so good. Mrs. Deardorff walks into the ward and everybody straightens up. Good Morning Mrs. Deardorff.
JOLENE=>She came here after you. Most of us are lifers. Been here a long time. Nobody’s gonna come for us now. We’re too old. Or too black.
THE GIRLS SINGING OVER...=>INT. CHAPEL - MORNING Miss. Lonsdale leads the girls in singing Bringing in the Sheaves. Beth, bored out of her skull, slips out of her seat, motions to MISS. LONSDALE that she “has to go.” Miss Lonsdale frowns. Beth indicates “really bad.” INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING The singing in the b.g. as Beth hurries to the stairs--
JOLENE=>You just be careful you don’t get too used to that feeling.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>Here, at Methuen, we don’t run in the halls. It’s unseemly.
BATS.=>Beth looks at an eerie-looking BISHOP. It starts to slide along the diagonal...
MR. SHAIBEL=>It’s not a rule. It’s sportsmanship. BETH
JOLENE=>What did you see?
JOLENE=>That’s right. You saw nothing. So you say nothing.
A SEQUENCE OF SHOTS=>Beth running up the corridor with the erasers. Beth in line for her pills. Beth playing with Mr. Shaibel. Beth stashing the pills. Beth watching the boy and girl from town making out at the fence. His hand up her shirt. Beth’s desk empty. Beth slamming down her queen and-- INT. BASEMENT - DAY
BOOM DOWN TO REVEAL=>Modern Chess Openings open under her desk.
ALICE=>Fear is just a phantom...
JOLENE=>What do you want?
MR. GANZ=>I’m also coach of the high school team. Duncan High?
BETH=>Mate in three.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>There’s only trouble on that side of the fence.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>But on this side... there’s love. Friendships. Family. All you need is right here, with us. Unless, of course, we’re not enough for you.
BETH=>Knight to K-5.
A FLASH AND--=>INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY The kids are all watching a movie called “HOW TO ACT AT
DINNERTIME.” ON BETH=>Watching the movie with a bored detachment as now behind her Fergussen makes his way into the room and scans their faces. He spots Beth, sitting with Jolene. He leans over the older girl and taps Beth on the shoulder. Jolene notes the closeness of his lean, gives him a look, as Beth gets up and follows Fergussen out of the room-- INT. CORRIDOR - DAY A frightened Beth follows a silent as usual Fergussen, her thick brown shoes squeaking on the linoleum behind him. He leads her to the door with the frosted glass window, HELEN DEARDORFF. SUPERINTENDANT. Beth takes a breath-- INT. MRS. DEARDORFF’S OFFICE - SAME Beth walks in and sees Mr. Ganz -- in a brown suit -- smile self-consciously and half rise from a red armchair, but sit back down as--
MRS. DEARDORFF=>Mr. Ganz tells me that you are a-- --gifted child.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>He has an unusual request to make. He would like you to be taken to the high school on...
MR. GANZ=>At the same time.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>But... I am a bit wary of letting Elizabeth go off to the local high school.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>Oh, no... I couldn’t possibly abandon my duties here.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>What do you say Elizabeth? Do you want to go play chess at the high school?
MRS. DEARDORFF=>I’m told that you’ve been playing chess with our custodian.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>I believe we have chess sets in the game closet. I’ll have Fergussen look into it.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>That will be all, Elizabeth. Mind your manners at the high school and be sure your nails are clean.
BETH=>Looks up, thoughtful.
SHIRLEY=>It’s my favorite.
REVERSE ON MR. SHAIBEL=>Quietly watching her. What’s that on his face? Concern? Admiration? Both? Hard to say. Finally--
MR. SHAIBEL=>You should get back.
IN HER STONED POV=>--exploding on the edge of the stool at her feet. The fragments, mixed with hundreds of green pellets, cascading to the linoleum floor. Bits of glass caught like rhinestones and lay in place while the green pills roll outward like a bright waterfall toward Mrs. Deardorff.
MRS. DEARDORFF=>If you are seen whispering to another child in chapel or in any class, you will automatically be given ten demerits. You understand the meaning of ten demerits, Elizabeth? Answer me.
FERGUSSEN=>Wanna help yourself?
BETH=>It felt funny.
MR. FERGUSSEN=>The darkest night is the bridge to the brightest tomorrow.
ON BETH FROM ABOVE=>As she looks up at the ceiling. And now... slowly... THE UPSIDE DOWN PIECES LINE UP IN OUR PERIPHERAL-- FROM BETH UP TO THE CEILING As she begins to play a game. The pieces move faster and faster. Before long, she’s playing two games. Now three. Four. Five... and so on. The light in the room changing, going from dark to slowly lighter and... THE PIECES FADE. BOOM DOWN as Fergussen sticks his head in the doorway of the Girls’ Ward, now wearing a beard.
PULLS INTO IMMEDIATE F.G. FROM THE WINDOW=>As Beth and Jolene watch as a MAN in a grey suit gets out of the driver’s side. And now a WOMAN in blue dress and sweater gets out of the passenger side.
