JACKIE/HARMONY’S KID=>So what’s the deal with chores and allowances? I turn eight and my mom says “I’ll give you ten dollars a week to make your room, wash the dishes and clean the cat’s litter box”. Ten dollars? That’s slave labor. I go to our neighbor’s house and I say, “What’ll you give me if I make your room, wash your dishes and clean your cat’s litter box?” Neighbor says I don’t have a cat. So I piss in her hallway and say, “You go to 15 a week and I’ll supply the pussy”.
