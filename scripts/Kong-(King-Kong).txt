WESTON=>Hey, Is this the moving picture ship?
WATCHMAN=>The Venture? Yep. You going on this crazy voyage?
WESTON=>What's crazy about it?
WATCHMAN=>I dunno know, but I hear everybody talkin' about this crazy feller that's running it.
WESTON=>Carl Denham?
WATCHMAN=>Guess that's the name. They say he ain't scare of nothin' - if he wants a picture of a lion he walks right up and tells it to look pleasant.
WESTON=>He's a tough egg, all right. But why the talk about this voyage being crazy?
WATCHMAN=>Wal, there's talk around the docks about the cargo for one thing. And I never see a ship this size with such a crew.
WESTON=>Not enough men to handle her?
WATCHMAN=>Not enough! The crew's three times too big for the ship. I dunno know where they find enough room to sleep.
DRISCOLL=>Hey, there! What do you want?
WESTON=>Denham aboard?
DRISCOLL=>Yes. Who are you?
WESTON=>I want to see him. I'm Weston, the agent.
DRISCOLL=>Come aboard. Denham's getting wild. Hope you have some good news for him.
ENGLEHORN=>Well, Mr. Denham, you know the reasons for hurrying as well as I do. The insurance company has found out we're carrying explosives, and the Marshal will be aboard tomorrow or next day.
DENHAM=>I suppose if we make a legal case of it, we'll be tied up for months.
ENGLEHORN=>With ship's articles falsified and ammunition enough aboard to blow up the harbor? And what do you think the Marshall will say to these new gas-bombs? According to you one of them is powerful enough to knock out an elephant.
DENHAM=>We've got to get to where we're going before the monsoon starts.
ENGLEHORN=>You can trust me to get you through a blow, I hope.
DENHAM=>Don't get sore, Skipper. But you know what it means to hit the tropical rainy season when we're making an outdoor picture. Months wasted, money gone, and nothing to show for it.
ENGLEHORN=>But still you always bring back a picture and everyone says, "There is only one Carl Denham."
DENHAM=>Weston! I was just going ashore to ring you up.
WESTON=>If I'd known that, I'd have waited.
DENHAM=>Meet the Skipper. This is Weston, the theatrical agent. And this is Driscoll, the first mate. Well, where's the girl, Weston?
WESTON=>It can't be done, Denham.
DENHAM=>What? It's got to done. Look here, Weston. The Actor's Equity and the Hays outfit have interfered with every girl I've tried to hire; now every agent in town has shut down on me. All but you. You know I'm square -
WESTON=>Everybody knows you're square, Denham but you've got a reputation for recklessness that can't be glossed over. And then you're so secretive.
DRISCOLL=>I'll say so.
ENGLEHORN=>When even the skipper and the mate don't know where they're going --
WESTON=>There you are. I've got a conscience, Denham. I can't send a young, pretty girl, such as you want, on a job like this without telling her what to expect.
DENHAM=>And what is she to expect?
WESTON=>To go off for no one knows how long, to some place you won't even hint at, the only woman on a ship with the toughest mugs I ever looked at. I mean the crew.
DENHAM=>Good Lord, you'd think I never brought anybody back alive! The Skipper and Driscoll have stuck by me on two trips. They seem healthy.
DRISCOLL=>Sure we're healthy.
ENGLEHORN=>But it's different taking a girl into danger.
DENHAM=>Oh, I suppose there's no danger in New York? Why, there are dozens of girls in this town tonight in more danger than they'd ever see with me.
DRISCOLL=>Sure. But they know that kind of danger.
WESTON=>You never had a woman in your other pictures, why do you want one in this?
DENHAM=>Holy mackerel D'ye think I want to haul a woman along?
WESTON=>Then why - ?
DENHAM=>Because the public - bless 'em - must have a pretty face to look at.
WESTON=>Everybody likes romance.
DENHAM=>Isn't there any romance or adventure in the world without a flapper in it?
ENGLEHORN=>Well, Mr. Denham, why not make a picture in a monastery?
DENHAM=>It makes me sore. I go out and sweat blood to make a swell picture, and then the exhibitors and critics all say, "if this picture had a love interest, it would gross twice as much." All right, the public wants a girl, and this time I'll give 'em what they want.
WESTON=>I don't know where you'll get her.
DENHAM=>Weston, I've got to. We've got to sail on the morning tide - we've got to be out of here by daylight -
WESTON=>Why?
DENHAM=>Well - there's a good reason.
WESTON=>Everything I hear makes me like this thing less. I'm glad I didn't get you a girl.
DENHAM=>You are, eh? Well, I'll show you. If you think I'm going to give up just because you can't find a girl with a backbone -- -- I'm going to make the greatest picture in the world, something that's never been seen or dreamed of. They'll have to invent some new adjectives when I come back.
ENGLEHORN=>Where are you going?
DENHAM=>I'm going to bring back a girl for my picture -- if I have to marry one!
GREEK=>Ah-ha! I catch you, you stealer! I catch the cop - you like that, ha!
ANN=>No-no, I didn't. Please let me go. I wanted to, but I didn't.
GREEK=>I had enough dese stealers --
DENHAM=>Oh, dry up. The kid didn't take anything.
ANN=>I didn't, truly I didn't.
DENHAM=>So, shut up, Socrates. Here's a dollar. Forget it.
DENHAM=>Hi! Taxi!
DENHAM=>Feeling better?
ANN=>Yes, thank you. You're very kind.
DENHAM=>Don't fool yourself. I'm not bothering with you just out of kindness. How come you're in this fix?
ANN=>Bad luck I guess. There are lots of girls just like me.
DENHAM=>There aren't such a lot who've got your looks.
ANN=>Oh, I can get by in good clothes. But when a girl gets too shabby --
DENHAM=>No family?
ANN=>I'm supposed to have an uncle somewhere.
DENHAM=>Ever do any acting?
ANN=>I used to do some extra jobs over at Fort Lee sometimes. Once I got a real part. The studio is shut down now.
DENHAM=>What's you name?
ANN=>Ann Darrow.
DENHAM=>Are you one of these city gals who screams at a mouse and faints at a snake?
ANN=>No, of course not. I'm a country gal - or used to be.
DENHAM=>Listen, sister. I've got a job for you. The costumes I've got on board will fit you. The Broadway shops will still be open. I'll get you some clothes for yourself. Come on.
ANN=>But - but what is it?
DENHAM=>It's money, and adventure, and fame. It's the thrill of a lifetime. And a long sea-voyage that starts at six tomorrow morning.
ANN=>No! Wait, I can't - I don't understand - you must tell me - I do want the job so - I was starving - but I can't -
DENHAM=>Oh, I see. You got me wrong. Nix, sister, nix. This is strictly business. I'm no chaser.
ANN=>I only wanted to -
DENHAM=>Sure. Sure you did. I dot excited and forgot you didn't understand it. Listen, I'm Carl Denham. Ever hear of me?
ANN=>Ye-es. Yes. You make moving pictures. In jungles and places.
DENHAM=>That's right. And I've picked you for the lead in my next picture. We sail at six.
ANN=>Where to?
DENHAM=>A long way from here. Think, Ann, a long voyage, easy living, the warm blue sea, moonlight on the water - isn't that better than tramping New York trying to keep out of the gutter.
ANN=>Oh, yes.
DENHAM=>I'm square, Ann. And I'll be square with you. No funny business.
ANN=>What do I have to go?
DENHAM=>Trust me. And keep your chin up.
DRISCOLL=>Carry that line aft! Aft, you farmer! Back there!
DRISCOLL=>Who the -- What are you going up here?
DRISCOLL=>Well, I'm sorry. You're the girl Denham found at the last minute, aren't you?
ANN=>Yes. I'm - I'm awfully excited. It's all so strange, and I've never been on a ship before.
DRISCOLL=>And I've never been on a ship with a woman before.
ANN=>I guess you don't think much of women on ships, do you?
DRISCOLL=>No. They're a cock-eyed nuisance.
ANN=>I'll try not to be.
DRISCOLL=>You got in the way already. Better stay below.
ANN=>What! The whole voyage!
DRISCOLL=>Say, I didn't apologize very good for hitting you. That was an awful sock in the jaw.
DRISCOLL=>Well, we're off.
ANN=>We're off.
ANN=>Charley, how many potatoes do you suppose you've peeled since we left New York six weeks ago?
CHARLEY=>Too many.
ANN=>Sailors eat an awful lot, don't they?
CHARLEY=>All time eat. No can fill up. Some day my go back to China, never see no more potato.
ANN=>There. That's fourteen knots I've learned to tie.
CHARLEY=>Pretty soon now you be same sailor. Only don't eat so much.
ANN=>I'd like to be a sailor. Isn't the sea wonderful!
CHARLEY=>Oh yes, very pretty.
ANN=>Of course it wasn't so nice up north when it was cold and rough.
CHARLEY=>Ocean very fine when you order weather how you like all same like eggs for breakfast.
DRISCOLL=>Hello, Ann.
ANN=>Hello, Jack.
DRISCOLL=>Where have you been all morning?
ANN=>Trying on costumes for Mr. Denham. He's going to make some tests of me this afternoon, here on deck, when the light's right.
DRISCOLL=>Tests? Why?
ANN=>Oh - to see which side of my face looks best - and all that.
DRISCOLL=>Both sides looks all right to me.
ANN=>Yes, but you're not the movie director.
DRISCOLL=>If I was, you wouldn't be here.
ANN=>Well, that's a nice thing to say.
DRISCOLL=>It's no place for a girl.
ANN=>I wish you wouldn't keep harping on that. It's very mean of you. Anybody'd think I'd been a lot of trouble.
ANN=>I haven't! You can't say I've been one bit of trouble to anyone.
ANN=>Have I?
DRISCOLL=>Sure you have.
ANN=>I don't see - Well, how?
DRISCOLL=>Just your being here's a trouble.
ANN=>Oh dead. I thought everything was going to nicely.
DRISCOLL=>Aw, you're swell. Women can't help being a bother. I guess they're made that way.
ANN=>Well, anyhow, I've had the happiest time of my life on this old ship.
DRISCOLL=>Why - that's fine.
DRISCOLL=>D'ye really mean that, Ann?
ANN=>Of course. Everyone's so nice to me - Mr. Denham and the Skipper - Don't you think the Skipper is a sweet old lamb?
DRISCOLL=>I'd hate to have him hear me say so.
ANN=>Ignatz is nice to me too. He likes me better than he does anyone else on board, don't you Iggy?
DENHAM=>Beauty and the Beast.
DRISCOLL=>Well, I never thought I was handsome, but -
DENHAM=>Go put on a costume, Ann. Light's good for those tests now.
ANN=>I won't be a minute, Mr. Denham.
DENHAM=>Beauty and the Beast.
DRISCOLL=>Mr. Denham, I've going to do some butting-in.
DENHAM=>What's your trouble, Driscoll?
DRISCOLL=>When do we find out where we're going?
DENHAM=>Pretty soon now.
DRISCOLL=>Are you going to tell us what happens when we get there?
DENHAM=>How can I? I'm no fortune-teller.
DRISCOLL=>But hang it, you must have some idea what you're after.
DENHAM=>Going soft on me, Jack?
DRISCOLL=>You know I'm not for myself. But Ann --
DENHAM=>Oh you've gone soft on her? I've got enough on my hands without a love affair to complicate things. Better cut it out, Jack
DRISCOLL=>Love affair! You think I'm going to fall for any dams?
DENHAM=>It never fails. Some big hard boiled egg goes goofy over a pretty face, and bingo! He cracks up and gets sappy.
DRISCOLL=>Who's getting sappy? I haven't run out on you, have I?
DENHAM=>Nope. You're a good tough guy, Jack. But if beauty gets you -- Why, I'm going right into a theme song!
DRISCOLL=>What are you talking about?
DENHAM=>It's the idea for my picture. The Beast was a tough guy, Jack. He could lick the world. But when he saw Beauty, she got him. He went soft, he forgot his wisdom, and the little fellers licked him. Think it over, Jack.
SAILOR=>Mr. Denham, the Skipper says will you please come up on the bridge? We've reached the position you marked, he says.
DENHAM=>Come on, Jack. You're in on this. I'm going to spill it.
ENGLEHORN=>Here's your noon position. 2 South, 90 East; you promised me some information when we reached these latitudes.
DENHAM=>'Way west of Sumatra.
ENGLEHORN=>And way out of any waters I know. I know the East Indies like my own hand, but I was never here.
DRISCOLL=>Where do we go from here?
DENHAM=>South-West.
ENGLEHORN=>South-West! But there is nothing - nothing for thousands of miles. What about food? So many in the crew makes the food melt away. And water? And coal?
DENHAM=>Take it easy, Skipper. We're not going thousands of miles. That's the island we're looking for.
ENGLEHORN=>The position -- I'll get the big chart.
DENHAM=>You won't find that island on any chart. That one there was made up by the skipper of a Norwegian Barque.
DRISCOLL=>He was kidding.
DENHAM=>No. Listen. A canoe with natives from this island was blown out to sea. When the barque picked them up, there was only one alive. He died before they reached port, but not before the skipper had pieced together a description of the island and got a fairly good idea of where it lies.
DRISCOLL=>Where did you get hold of it?
DENHAM=>Two years ago, in Singapore, going home from my last trip. I've known that skipper for years. He knew I'd be interested.
ENGLEHORN=>Does he believe it himself?
DENHAM=>I don't know. But I do. See, here's what the island looks like.
DENHAM=>Here's a long sandy peninsula. The only possible landing place is through this reef. The rest of the shore-line is sheer precipice, hundreds of feet high. And across the base of that peninsula, cutting it off from the rest of the island, is a wall.
ENGLEHORN=>A wall?
DENHAM=>Built so long ago that the people who live there now have slipped back, forgotten the high civilization that built it. But it's as strong today as it was centuries ago. The natives keep that wall in repair. They need it.
DRISCOLL=>Why?
DENHAM=>There's something on the other side - something they fear.
ENGLEHORN=>A hostile tribe.
DENHAM=>Did you ever hear of -- KONG?
ENGLEHORN=>Why -- yes. Some Malay superstition. A god or a spirit or something.
DENHAM=>Anyway, neither beast nor man. Monstrous, all-powerful -- still living, still holding that island in the grip of deadly fear.
DENHAM=>Every legend has a basis of truth. I tell you there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen.
ENGLEHORN=>And you expect to photograph it?
DENHAM=>If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.
DRISCOLL=>Suppose it doesn't like having it's picture taken?
DENHAM=>Well, now you know why I brought those cases of gas-bombs.
DENHAM=>Oh, you picked out the Beauty and the Beast costume!
ANN=>It's the prettiest.
DENHAM=>All right. Stand over there.
ANN=>I'm sort of nervous. Suppose I don't photograph well?
DENHAM=>Don't let that worry you. If I hadn't been sure of that, I wouldn't have brought you half way round the world.
ANN=>What shall I do?
DENHAM=>Now when I start cranking hold it a minute, then turn slowly toward me. Look at me, look surprised, then smile a little, listen and then laugh. All right, camera.
1ST SAILOR=>Looks kinda silly, don't it?
2ND SAILOR=>She's sure a pretty dame.
CHARLEY=>You think maybe he like take my picture, huh?
1ST SAILOR=>Them camera cost money. Shouldn't think he'd risk it.
DENHAM=>That was fine. I'm going to try a filter on this one.
ANN=>Do you always take the pictures yourself?
DENHAM=>Ever since a trip I made to Africa. I'd have got a swell picture of a charging rhino, but the cameraman got scared. The damned fool. I was right there with a rifle. Seemed he didn't trust me to get the rhino before it got him. I haven't fooled with cameramen since. Do the trick myself.
DRISCOLL=>Think he's crazy, Skipper?
ENGLEHORN=>Just enthusiastic!
DRISCOLL=>But this yarn about unknown islands and monstrous gods --
ENGLEHORN=>He pays us well to take him where he wants to go. If the island exists, we will find it.
DENHAM=>Now Ann, stand there. Look down. When I start to crank, look up slowly. You're quite calm, don't expect to see anything. Follow my directions. All right -- camera.
DENHAM=>Now -- look up. Slowly. You see nothing yet. Look higher. Still higher. That's it. Now you see it. You're amazed. You can't believe it. Your eyes open wider. It's horrible, but you can't look away. What is it Ann? What can you do? No chances for you, no escape. Helpless, Ann, you're helpless. One chance -- if you can scream. Your throat's paralyzed. Try to scream, Ann. Try. If you didn't see, perhaps you could scream. Throw you arms across your eyes, and scream, Ann, scream for your life!
DRISCOLL=>What's he think she's really going to see?
DENHAM=>This infernal fog! Sure of your position, Skipper?
ENGLEHORN=>Of course. Last night, before the fog shut down, I got a good sight.
DENHAM=>We must be near the island.
DRISCOLL=>If we don't see it when this fog lifts we never shall. We've quartered these parts.
SAILOR=>No bottom at 30 fathoms!
DRISCOLL=>Of course that Norwegian skipper was guessing at the position.
ANN=>How will we know it's the right island?
DENHAM=>The mountain that looks like a skull.
ANN=>Yes. I'd forgotten. You told me that. Skull Mountain.
SAILOR'S VOICE=>Bottom! 20 fathoms!
ENGLEHORN=>Shallowing fast, Driscoll, dead slow.
DENHAM=>Curse the fog!
SAILOR'S VOICE=>Sixteen fathoms!
DENHAM=>What does she draw, Skipper?
ENGLEHORN=>Six.
DRISCOLL=>Listen! Hear anything?
DENHAM=>No.
ANN=>No.
MAN IN CROWS NEST=>Breakers ahead!
SAILOR'S VOICE=>Ten fathoms!
DRISCOLL=>Let go!
DRISCOLL=>That's not breakers. That's drums.
DENHAM=>Well, Skipper, see anybody?
ENGLEHORN=>Not a living thing. I think there are more houses in the thick bush.
DENHAM=>Funny they haven't spotted us. I think the whole population would be on the beach.
ENGLEHORN=>Listen.
DENHAM=>Maybe they have seen us and are signalling. Well, Skipper, do you believe me now? There's Skull Mountain, the wall - everything just like my funny map. Come on, let's get started.
ENGLEHORN=>Twelve men go with you. The rest stay aboard.
DENHAM=>Who's in charge of the gas bombs?
ENGLEHORN=>Jimmy. That young feller.
DENHAM=>Good. Leave the 2nd Mate aboard, Skipper. I need you, you may be able to talk to these birds ashore.
ANN=>I'm going ashore with you, aren't I?
DENHAM=>You bet.
DRISCOLL=>She ought not to go till we find out what goes on --
DENHAM=>Say, who's running this show? I've learned by experience to keep my cast and my cameras right with me. You never can tell when you'll want 'em.
DRISCOLL=>But it's crazy to risk --
DENHAM=>Oh, go on, Jack. Get busy. Deal out the rifles and ammunition. And pick me a couple of huskies to carry my stuff.
DENHAM=>Bring the costume box. We might get a swell shot right away if we're lucky.
DENHAM=>You fellers with the camera stay close to me. Where's Jimmy with the bombs?
JIMMY=>Here, sir.
DENHAM=>All right. Stick around. And watch your step. There's enough trichloride in that case to put a herd of hippos to sleep.
JIMMY=>Aye Aye, sir.
ANN=>What queer-looking boats.
DRISCOLL=>Outrigger canoes.
ENGLEHORN=>Driscoll, have two men stay with the boat.
DRISCOLL=>All attended to, sir.
DENHAM=>Now, all set? Ready, Skipper?
ENGLEHORN=>Ready.
ENGLEHORN=>Not a soul in sight.
DENHAM=>That wall, Skipper! What d'ye say to that, eh?
ENGLEHORN=>Colossal! It might almost be Egyptian.
DENHAM=>But what's on the other side? That's what I want to know.
ANN=>Who do you suppose could have built it?
DRISCOLL=>Aw, I went up to Angkor once. That's bigger than this - and nobody knows who built it.
DENHAM=>Oh, boy! What a chance! What a picture!
DENHAM=>Come on!
DENHAM=>Hear that! They're saying Kong! Kong!
DRISCOLL=>Hope you'll be able to speak their lingo Skipper.
DENHAM=>Can you catch any words yet?
ENGLEHORN=>I'm not sure. It sounds something like the language the Nias Islanders speak.
ANN=>What do you suppose is happening?
DRISCOLL=>Up to some of their heathen tricks. Now don't go rushing out to see.
ANN=>All right. But isn't it exciting!
DRISCOLL=>Sure. I wish we'd left you on the ship.
ANN=>I'm so glad you didn't.
DENHAM=>Wait. Easy row. Stay here till I see what goes on.
DENHAM=>Holy mackerel! What a show! Skipper, get a look at this!
DENHAM=>Did you ever see anything like that before? If I can steal a shot before they see us -
DENHAM=>Hey! You with the camera!
ANN=>I want to see.
ENGLEHORN=>Come on and look, but be careful.
CHIEF=>Bado! Dama pati vego!
DENHAM=>Too late, they see us.
JIMMY=>Let's beat it!
DRISCOLL=>Hold on there! What are you running for?
DENHAM=>No use trying to hide now. Everybody come out here in plain sight. Put up a bold front.
CHIEF=>Bado! Maka mini tau ansaro.
2ND SAILOR=>Say, let's scram outa this.
DRISCOLL=>Stand still, you fool!
DENHAM=>Steady, boys. Don't get nervous.
DRISCOLL=>Never let a native see you're worried, boys. Bluff 'em.
CHIEF=>Watu! Tama di? Tama di?
DENHAM=>Come on Skipper, make him a friendly speech.
ENGLEHORN=>Tabe! Bala kum nono hi. Bala! Bala!
CHIEF=>Bala reri! Tasko! Tasko! (We don't want friends, Go! Get out!
DENHAM=>He understands you, Skipper! What's he say?
ENGLEHORN=>Telling us to get out.
DENHAM=>Talk him out of it. Ask him what goes on.
ENGLEHORN=>Vana di humya? Malem ani humya vana?
CHIEF=>Ani saba Kong!
ENGLEHORN=>He says the girl there is the bride of Kong.
DENHAM=>Great! Find out what they're going to do.
WITCH DOCTOR=>Dama si kasi! Dama si kasi! Punya bas! Punya!
CHIEF=>Tasko!
DENHAM=>What's that?
ENGLEHORN=>He must be the witch-doctor. He says the ceremony is spoiled because we have seen it.
DENHAM=>What's the word for friends?
ENGLEHORN=>Bala.
DENHAM=>Calm the old boy down.
CHIEF=>Punya!
ENGLEHORN=>I don't like the looks of this, Denham. The women have cleared out. That's a bad sign.
CHIEF=>Sita! Malem! Malem me pakeno!
DENHAM=>What's that?
ENGLEHORN=>He says look at the golden woman.
DENHAM=>Blondes are scarce around here.
CHIEF=>Malem ma pakapo! Kong wa bisa! Kow bisa para Kong!
ENGLEHORN=>A gift for Kong, he says.
DENHAM=>Good Lord!
CHIEF=>Dama, tebo malem na hi?
ENGLEHORN=>Wants to buy her.
CHIEF=>Sani sita malem ati - - kow dia malem ma pakeno.
ENGLEHORN=>He's offering to trade us six of his girls for Ann.
DRISCOLL=>You got her into this, Denham.
ENGLEHORN=>Tida, tida! Malem ati rota na hi.
DRISCOLL=>I'm going to take her back to the ship.
ENGLEHORN=>We'd better all get out before they think to cut us off from the beach.
DENHAM=>I guess so. But tell him we'll come back tomorrow to make friends.
ENGLEHORN=>Dulu hi tego. Bala. Dulu.
DENHAM=>Get going, Ann. Don't act scared. Everything's all right. Smile, Ann. Talk to Jack. Keep your chin up!
ANN=>-- and an enormous wall, Charley, all the way across that piece of land where we went ashore.
CHARLEY=>What fashion that girl do -- that girl with flowers on her?
ANN=>The poor thing, she looked -- as though she was too frightened to feel frightened. You know?
CHARLEY=>Sacrifice.
ANN=>The Chief said she was the bride of Kong. Charley, what do you suppose Kong is?
CHARLEY=>My guess he very big joss this place. People here plenty scared. You don't worry. No can help.
ANN=>Oh, there's Ignatz! He's broken loose again.
ANN=>Catch him, Charley. He'll get in the cabins and break things.
CHARLEY=>My catch him. Bad devil, come here.
DRISCOLL=>Why aren't you in bed?
ANN=>I can't sleep. Those drums make me nervous, I guess.
DRISCOLL=>I think Denham's off his nut, taking you ashore today.
ANN=>I was -- sort of scared there for a while.
DRISCOLL=>Huh! You weren't the only one.
ANN=>I wonder what we do next?
DRISCOLL=>That's what's worrying me. Denham's such a fool for risks. No telling what he'll ask you to do.
ANN=>After what he did for me, I'll do anything he wants.
DRISCOLL=>Don't talk like that. When it comes to getting a picture, he's crazy enough to try anything.
ANN=>I won't go back on him.
DRISCOLL=>When I think what might have happened today -- if anything happened to you.
ANN=>Why then you wouldn't be bothered with a woman on board.
DRISCOLL=>Don't laugh. I'm scared for you. I'm sort of - I'm scared of you, too. Ann, I -- I guess I love you.
ANN=>Jack! You hate women!
DRISCOLL=>You aren't -- women. I love you. Ann, I don't suppose -- you don't feel like that about me -- do you?
ENGLEHORN'S VOICE=>Mr. Driscoll! Are you on deck?
DRISCOLL=>Yes, sir.
ENGLEHORN'S VOICE=>Please come up here a minute.
DRISCOLL=>Yes, sir.
ANN=>I'll wait here for you.
DENHAM=>Now tomorrow morning, pick out the men to go ashore. Couple of those nervous boys you better leave aboard.
ENGLEHORN=>Mr. Denham wants you to break out the trade goods the first thing tomorrow.
DENHAM=>We'll try a little bribery.
DRISCOLL=>Still hoping to make friends with that bunch ashore?
DENHAM=>Sure. We've got to. I've got to find out what Kong is.
ENGLEHORN=>He's their tribal legend, their god, of course.
DRISCOLL=>You planning to make movies of a fairy story?
DENHAM=>How do you know Kong's only a legend or a fairy story? That wall wasn't built for fun.
DRISCOLL=>But you said yourself it was built so long ago the people who live here now don't know anything about it.
DENHAM=>Yes, but they've kept it in damn good repair. Did you see how those gates were fastened? They're meant to keep something out.
ENGLEHORN=>After ten. And they're still at is ashore.
DENHAM=>If I could only take pictures by firelight! I'd sneak back there now and get a scene.
ENGLEHORN=>Be sensible. We're lucky to be all safe aboard tonight.
DENHAM=>Oh sure, sure.
DENHAM=>What is is, Jack?
DRISCOLL=>Oh -- er -- I was looking for Ann. She's gone below, I guess.
DENHAM=>How about turning in, Skipper?
ENGLEHORN=>No, not for me tonight.
DENHAM=>But you've set a watch in the bow.
DENHAM=>Oh well, I'll sit up with you then.
ENGLEHORN=>Mr. Driscoll, I wish you'd take a star sight. See how our position checks up with what I got last night before we ran into the fog.
DRISCOLL=>Yes sir. I guess it's been a long time since the map-makers got a brand new island to put down.
ENGLEHORN=>That's about it. We'll make absolutely sure tomorrow noon.
DENHAM=>About midnight. Hey, look at that.
ENGLEHORN=>Torches going through the village.
DENHAM=>Looks like the night before election.
DENHAM=>Listen to 'em, will you? Wonder what's up.
CHARLEY=>My don't know, sir. My not see Missy one, two hour.
DRISCOLL=>Guess, she's in her cabin.
CHARLEY=>On deck! On deck!
SAILOR IN BOW=>All hands on deck!
CHARLEY=>Look sir! My found on deck.
ENGLEHORN=>A native bracelet!
CHARLEY=>Crazy black man that place comes this place!
DRISCOLL=>Who's turning out the crew? What's the matter?
ENGLEHORN=>Charley found this. Some one's been aboard. Search the ship.
DRISCOLL=>Oh my God! Where's Ann?
DENHAM=>In her cabin -
DRISCOLL=>No, she isn't! I just looked.
ENGLEHORN=>Bos'n!
BOS'N'S VOICE=>Yes sir.
ENGLEHORN=>Man the boats. Serve out the rifles. Search the ship.
BOS'N'S VOICE=>Yes sir.
DENHAM=>The boats, Skipper? D'ye think -- ?
ENGLEHORN=>They may have stolen something.
CHIEF=>Kara Ta ni, Kong. O Taro Vey, Rama Kong. Wa saba ani mako, O Taro Vey, Rama Kong.
DRISCOLL=>He's got Ann! Who's coming with me?
1ST SAILOR=>I'll go.
2ND SAILOR=>Sure. Me too.
3RD SAILOR=>I'm going, sir.
DRISCOLL=>All right. Here you - and you -
DENHAM=>What did you see?
DRISCOLL=>Skipper, you stay here with half the men and guard this gate. Don't let 'em close it.
DENHAM=>Who's got the bombs?
DRISCOLL=>Come on, you fellers.
DENHAM=>Keep the gate open for us, Skipper.
DENHAM=>No telling where he's gone in this darkness.
DRISCOLL=>He came by here. Look at those broken branches.
DENHAM=>That's right. He's up ahead somewhere.
DRISCOLL=>The sun ought to be rising about now.
DENHAM=>Listen to those birds. It's dawn all right.
DRISCOLL=>Look here.
DENHAM=>Look at the size of that. He must be as big as a house. He's come this way, all right.
DRISCOLL=>And he's heading that way. Come on.
DENHAM=>Keep those guns cocked.
SAILOR IN BLACK SWEATER=>He's telling us!
DRISCOLL=>That's right. We're on his trail.
DRISCOLL=>There!
SAILORS=>Look out! Look out!
DENHAM=>Great Scott, that's something I didn't know about.
DRISCOLL=>I got an idea there's plenty on this island you weren't figuring on.
DENHAM=>Gimme one of those bombs.
DRISCOLL=>It won't stop him.
DENHAM=>Wait a minute. He's only knocked out.
DENHAM=>I told you those gas bombs would bring down anything. We'll get that ape alive.
DRISCOLL=>We're not trying to catch the ape - we're trying to save that girl. Come on - we're losing time.
DENHAM=>There's his foot again -- -- he's down in that hollow where the fog is, some place.
DRISCOLL=>There's water down there. Here.
DENHAM=>That's him, splashing through. Come on.
DRISCOLL=>He must have swum across.
DENHAM=>That's out for us. We can't swim with guns and bombs.
DRISCOLL=>How about these -- -- for a raft?
DENHAM=>Yeah, that's it. A raft.
DRISCOLL=>All right, boys, gets busy.
1ST SAILOR=>Get some vines, Tim.
2ND SAILOR=>Pull 'em clear now.
DENHAM=>Don't get the arms wet, boys.
SAILOR A=>I'm watching 'em.
SAILOR B=>Easy now.
DRISCOLL=>All set? All set, everybody?
SAILORS=>All set. Let 'er go.
TOGETHER=>O.K.
DRISCOLL=>Shove off.
DENHAM=>Easy now -- keep her against the current.
DRISCOLL=>Keep your weight in the center, boys -- weight in the center.
1ST SAILOR=>Holy mackerel -- look at that.
SAILOR A=>It's Tim he's after.
DENHAM=>Hasn't anybody got a gun?
DRISCOLL=>They're all at the bottom of the lake.
BOMB CARRIER=>I had to let them go to keep from drowning.
DENHAM=>You fool.
BOMB CARRIER=>You lost your gun.
DRISCOLL=>Down! Down!
DENHAM=>If we only had some of those bombs!
SAILOR WITH STRIPED TROUSERS=>Boys - boys, where are you?
DENHAM=>Jack - Jack Driscoll.
DENHAM=>Hey -- Jack.
DRISCOLL=>It didn't get you, huh?
DENHAM=>I got to cover, same as you. I guess we're safe now.
DRISCOLL=>Safe like a cow in the stockyards. There's only two of us left alive, to save that girl.
DENHAM=>I can't get across now.
DRISCOLL=>I don't want you to. You got to lam back for some more of them bombs.
DENHAM=>You wouldn't follow that beast alone?
DRISCOLL=>Someone's got to keep on his trail while it's hot. Maybe I'll get a chance to snake her away -- and if I don't I'll figure some way to signal your party where he's taken her.
DENHAM=>I guess that's the only out.
DRISCOLL=>Sure it is. Get going now -- and don't get croaked till you give the office to Englehorn.
DENHAM=>O.K., Jack. Good luck.
DRISCOLL=>See you later...maybe
DENHAM=>--Skipper, I tell you this Kong is the biggest thing on earth. He shook the men off that log like flies.
ENGLEHORN=>All those men lost! Incredible!
DENHAM=>Driscoll said he'd try to signal us when he found Ann.
ENGLEHORN=>We'll never see either of them again.
2ND MATE=>Don't give up, Skipper. There's still a chance for Driscoll.
DENHAM=>We'll have to wait for daylight. Then we'll bridge the ravine. Where's that other case of bombs?
SAILOR=>Here, sir.
ENGLEHORN=>This--this monster that you saw, will he care for bombs.
DENHAM=>If we can get near enough to use 'em, you bet he'll care. Had any trouble with the natives?
ENGLEHORN=>Yes, just after you left.
DENHAM=>What happened?
ENGLEHORN=>We fired a couple volleys over their heads, and they took to their huts like scared rabbits.
DENHAM=>Gunpowder's something new in their lives, huh?
ENGLEHORN=>They're terrified.
2ND MATE=>They've kept under cover ever since.
DENHAM=>Briggs, get up on the wall and keep your eyes peeled. We'll start at dawn, whether we get a signal for Driscoll or not.
LOOKOUT ON WALL=>Driscoll and the lady -- coming up from the woods, sir.
ENGLEHORN=>Gott sei dank!
DENHAM=>Give her to me.
ENGLEHORN=>Good man, Jack!
ENGLEHORN=>Here.
ANN=>I'm all right. Oh Jack.
ENGLEHORN=>Now, now. You're safe. We'll be back on the ship in no time.
DENHAM=>Wait a minute. What about Kong?
DRISCOLL=>What about him?
DENHAM=>We came here to make a moving picture, but we've found something worth all the movies in the world.
ENGLEHORN=>What!
DENHAM=>We've got the bombs. If we capture him alive --
DRISCOLL=>You're crazy. Anyway, he's on top of a cliff where an army couldn't get at him.
DENHAM=>If he chooses to stay there.
DENHAM=>We've got something he wants.
DRISCOLL=>Something he won't get again.
DRISCOLL=>He's followed us!
DENHAM=>Shut the gate - shut the gate.
ENGLEHORN=>All hands on the gate.
DENHAM=>The bombs! Who's got the bombs!
ENGLEHORN=>Are you hurt?
DENHAM=>Come on. We've got him.
DENHAM=>He'll be out for hours. Send off to the ship for anchor-chain, Skipper. And tools.
ENGLEHORN=>What are you going to do?
DENHAM=>Build a raft to float him out to the ship. The whole world'll pay to see this!
ENGLEHORN=>No chains will hold -- that.
DENHAM=>We'll give him more than chains. He's always been king of the world. But we'll teach him fear. We're millionaires. I'll share with all of you. Listen, boys a few months from now it'll be in lights on Broadway -- Kong, the Eight Wonder.
1ST MAN=>What is it, anyhow?
2ND MAN=>They say it's sort of a gorilla.
1ST MAN=>Gee, ain't we got enough of them in New York?
YOUNG MAN=>I hear it's bigger'n an elephant.
GIRL=>Does it do tricks or what?
WOMAN=>Heavens, what a mob.
HER HUSBAND=>Well, you would come. And the tickets cost me twenty bucks.
ANN=>I don't like to look at him, Jack. It makes me feel the way I did that awful day on the island.
DRISCOLL=>I wouldn't have brought you, but you know how Denham insisted.
ANN=>Of course we had to come when he said it would help the show. Do you suppose we'll really make a lot of money, Jack?
DRISCOLL=>Enough to pay him back for these clothes, anyway...I never had an open-face suit before.
DENHAM=>Hello, you're just on time. You look great, Ann. Glad I dressed you up for this show. Hello, Jack. Ten thousand dollars in the box office. How's that for one night?
DRISCOLL=>Say! That's money!
DENHAM=>Oh, we're going to do that every night. The newspaper boys are coming in now.
DENHAM=>Miss Darrow, boys. And Mr. Driscoll.
1ST REPORTER=>It was Mr. Driscoll rescued you from the ape, wasn't it?
ANN=>Yes. He was alone. All the sailors with him had been killed.
2ND REPORTER=>Alone, eh? Whew! How did you tackle that baby?
DRISCOLL=>Aw, Denham's the one that got him. The rest of us were running like rabbits, but Denham had the nerve to stand still and chuck gas-bombs at him.
DENHAM=>No, lay off me. Miss Darrow is the story. If it hadn't been for her, we'd never have got near KONG. He came back to the village for her.
3RD REPORTER=>Beauty and the Beast, huh?
DENHAM=>That's it. Play up that angle. Beauty and the Beast. KONG could have stayed safe where we'd never have got him, but he couldn't stay away from Beauty. That's your story, boys.
2ND REPORTER=>It's a story all right.
1ST PHOTOGRAPHER=>How about a few pictures?
DENHAM=>Wait. I want you to take flashlights on the stage in front of the audience. We'll ring the curtain up now, and I'll make a speech. Tell 'em about KONG and Miss Darrow and Driscoll. Then when I call you, you all come on and take pictures.
DENHAM=>Come on Ann. I want you and Jack there when the curtain goes up.
ANN=>Oh, no.
DENHAM=>It's all right. We've knocked some of the fight out of him since you saw him.
DENHAM=>Ladies and gentlemen, I am here tonight to tell you a strange story. So strange a story that no one will believe it. But, ladies and gentlemen, seeing is believing, and we -- I and my partners -- have brought back the living proof of our adventure, an adventure in which twelve of our party met terrible deaths.
2ND PHOTOGRAPHER=>Holy smoke, look at that!
1ST PHOTOGRAPHER=>Hope he's tied up good and plenty.
1ST REPORTER=>Sure he is. Denham's taking no chances.
DENHAM=>- and now, ladies and gentlemen, before I tell you more, I am going to show you the greatest sight your eyes ever beheld. He was the king and the god of the world he knew, but now he comes to civilization, merely a captive, a show to gratify your curiosity. Ladies and gentlemen, look at KONG, the Eight Wonder of the World.
DENHAM=>I want to introduce Miss Ann Darrow. The pluckiest girl I've ever known.
DENHAM=>There the Beast, and here the Beauty. She has lived through an experience that no other woman ever dreamed of. And she was rescued from the very grasp of KONG by her future husband. I want you to meet a very brave gentleman, Mr. John Driscoll.
DENHAM=>Now, before I tell you the full story of our voyage. I am going to ask the gentlemen of the press to come forward, so that the audience may have the privilege of seeing them take the first photographs of KONG and his captors.
DENHAM=>Miss Darrow first, alone. Stand in front of KONG, Ann.
1ST PHOTOGRAPHER=>That's it - That's near enough.
2ND PHOTOGRAPHER=>Ready. Hold it. Smile, please.
DENHAM=>Don't be alarmed, ladies and gentlemen. Those chains are made of chrome steel. He can't move.
DRISCOLL=>It's all right, Ann.
DENHAM=>Get them together, boys. They're going to be married tomorrow.
1ST PHOTOGRAPHER=>Put your arm around her, Driscoll.
DENHAM=>Wait. Hold on. He thinks you're attacking the girl.
1ST PHOTOGRAPHER=>Let him roar. Swell picture. Get this.
DRISCOLL=>My hotel! Across the street!
1ST MAN=>Sweeten it - sweeten it.
3RD MAN=>What's all the doings over there at the theatre?
2ND MAN=>Sounds like a three-alarm fire.
4TH MAN=>Aw, some movie stunt about a monkey.
5TH MAN=>I hear the theatre's sold out.
3RD MAN=>This town sure is full of hicks.
1ST MAN=>Barnum was right.
DRISCOLL=>Hush, Ann. Hush, darling. It's all right. You're safe here.
WOMAN=>Yes, Jimmy, it's Mabel - I been waiting for you to call up.
JIMMY=>Howya, kid. Glad I'm back?
WOMAN=>You bet I'm glad you're back...I got your postal. Talk louder, Jimmy, there's fire-engines going by. I can't hear...
JIMMY=>Gonna step out with me, kid? Ya save the evening like I told ya?
MABEL=>Sure I saved the evening...Nine o'clock'll be swell...And say, wait until you see my new outfit...All right, I'll be there...Say, when did I ever break a date with you, honey...
JIMMY=>Whatsa matter? Hey, kid, what yer yelling -- Mabel! Mabel! Operator, something's happened!
DRISCOLL=>We'll stay here, dear. I won't leave you. They'll get him. It's all right.
ANN=>It's a like a horrible dream. It's like -- being back there -- on the island.
DENHAM=>Jack! He's climbing up, outside there.
DRISCOLL=>He got Ann. He's taking her up.
DENHAM=>The roof! Quick!
DENHAM=>What'll we do?
DRISCOLL=>Fire Department searchlights. They'll keep him in sight.
1ST FIREMAN=>Where is he?
2ND FIREMAN=>He went that way.
1ST FIREMAN=>He may have fallen.
1ST FIREMAN=>There! There he is.
2ND FIREMAN=>He's still got the girl.
3RD FIREMAN=>He's turned. He's going back.
2ND FIREMAN=>Where's he gone?
1ST COP=>Can you see him?
2ND FIREMAN=>No. Lost sight of him half and hour ago.
1ST MAN=>They say he's disappeared.
2ND MAN=>Well, what could he hide in?
1ST MAN=>Gee, I hope he don't come down in the street.
2ND MAN=>You said it.
SERGEANT=>Yes? Yes...No, not yet...Headquarters is broadcasting the reports.
THE LOUDSPEAKER=>Kong, the giant ape, is still at large. He has not been seen since midnight. The whole city is aroused. We are hoping for a report at any moment.
DENHAM=>Snap out of it, Jack. They're bound to find him when morning comes.
DRISCOLL=>I can't do anything. Ann's out there -- somewhere --
DENHAM=>But we're pretty sure he won't hurt her.
DRISCOLL=>He may have dropped her. She may be lying somewhere.
THE LOUDSPEAKER=>Attention, all stations! Kong has been seen again. He is on the roofs of the warehouses at 41st Street. He is going toward the East River. He is still carrying Ann Darrow.
SERGEANT=>Yes?...Yes, the report just come in...I don't know. What can we do without killing the girl, too?
DENHAM=>If he puts Ann down --
SERGEANT=>It'll be daylight in an hour. Keep him in sight.
THE LOUDSPEAKER=>Kong is going West. He is making for the Empire State Building.
DRISCOLL=>If he goes up there, what can we do?
SERGEANT=>We won't be able to get near him.
THE LOUDSPEAKER=>Kong is climbing the Empire State. He is still carrying Ann Darrow.
DENHAM=>That's licked us.
DRISCOLL=>There's one thing that hasn't been tried.
SERGEANT=>What?
DRISCOLL=>Airplanes. If he should put Ann down -- if they could fly near enough to pick him off -- without hitting Ann --
SERGEANT=>You're right! Planes -- as soon as it's daylight --
DENHAM=>Here comes the planes.
POLICEMAN=>They'll get him.
DRISCOLL=>Can they shoot him and not hit Ann?
POLICEMAN=>Hold on. Don't you get on that roof too.
DENHAM=>Give the pilots a chance, Jack.
POLICE CAPTAIN=>It's no use. All night we've been after him -- and never got near enough to take a shot.
POLICE LIEUTENANT=>It'll be daylight soon. That ought to help.
POLICE CAPTAIN=>Help the ape, maybe.
DRISCOLL=>There he goes -- making for the Empire State Building.
POLICE CAPTAIN=>If he takes the girl up there with him, we're fair beat.
POLICE LIEUTENANT=>That's right. We can't shoot him down while he has the girl.
DRISCOLL=>Wait a minute. There's one thing we haven't tried.
POLICE CAPTAIN=>And what is that?
DRISCOLL=>Air planes. The army planes from Roosevelt Field. They might find a way to pick him off without touching her.
POLICE CAPTAIN=>You're right. Get to a phone, Tim. Call the field, - burn up the wires -
DRISCOLL=>Ann! Ann! Are you all right? Oh, my darling, sure you're not hurt?
ANN=>Ad lib.
COP=>Gee, what a sight. Well, the aviators got him.
DENHAM=>Oh no, 'twasn't the aviators It was Beauty killed the Beast.
