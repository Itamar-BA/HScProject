SNACKS=>all over the room, and it�s obvious there hasn�t been much studying going on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.
MASAMI=>What�s up with you?
TOMOKO=>It's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the
GIRL.=>She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.
�O�=>as she�s suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright. She continues staring, silently, at the camera.
HOUSE=>with a small covered parkway for a garage. She gets out of her car, closes the door. She stares at the house, unmoving.
PAPER=>on Tomoko�s desk flutters in the breeze. Asakawa walks towards it, picks it up. It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop. The developed photos have yet to be claimed.
PICTURE=>obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely round personages. She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.
CLOCK.=>It�s about seven minutes after 7 P.M.
DOORBELL,=>but the door has already opened from within. Asakawa leans out, holding the door open for him. Neither of them speaks. Wordlessly, Ryuji enters the apartment.
TV,=>ejects the tape from the deck.
BAG=>filled with groceries.
ASAKAWA=>What does that mean?
SIGNBOARD=>in both hands.
BUSINESS=>SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO. A BANNER hangs above the stage, which reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.
SHIZUKO=>Sadako? Was it you?
RYUJI=>We�ve been cursed.
ASAKAWA=>Just one more day...
DOOR=>just short of a slam. CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone. She half- runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring blankly into space. Ryuji slides into the driver�s seat, buckles his SEATBELT.
RYUJI=>Lower the buckets!
SOUND=>like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber. It is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair. CUT to shot of Asakawa�s face. Far from being frightened, her features are oddly placid. She regards the fearsome thing before her with an almost tender look. Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long hair.
BLANKET=>draped over her shoulder.
