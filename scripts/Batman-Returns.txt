GIDDY YULETIDE SINGERS=>"He knows when you are sleeping, he knows when you're awake..."
HAPPY COUPLE=>Merry Christmas!
SWEET MICROPHONED VOICE=>Could I have your attention, Gotham City?
ICE PRINCESS=>It's time for tonight's Lighting of the Tree! How 'bout that!
THE CREEPY LIPS=>"I know when you are sleeping, I know when you're awake."
PAPERBOY=>Read about the latest sighting of the Penguin creature! He was seen torching a homeless shelter, robbing a blind --
ALFRED=>Dear Boy! Sometimes it is a diversion to read such piffle. Most times it is a waste of time.
MAYOR=>Well here's hoping ... With Batman protecting us, and all your enterprises keeping our economy on full boil, Gotham just might have its first real Christmas in a good long while.
MAX=>I feel almost vulgar, in this Yuletide context, about mentioning the new power plant. But if we're gonna break ground when we've gotta break ground, I'll need permits, variances, tax incentives ... that sort of pesky nonsense.
MAYOR=>"Power plant"? Max, our studies show that Gotham has enough energy sources to sustain growth into the next cen--
MAX=>Your analysts are talking growth at one percent per annum. That's not growth, that's a mild swelling. I'm planning ahead for a revitalized Gotham City ... So we can light the whole plaza without worrying about brownouts ... Do you like the sound of "brownouts"? Do you?
MAX=>Imagine a Gotham City of the future lit up like a blanket of stars ... but blinking on and off, embarrassingly low on juice. Frankly I cringe, Mr. Mayor.
CHIP=>Dad. Mr. Mayor ... It's time to go downstairs and bring joy to the masses.
MAYOR=>Sorry. You'll have to submit reports, blueprints and plans to the usual committees, through the usual channels.
SELINA=>Um, I had a suggestion. Well, really, actually more of just a question ...
MAX=>I'm afraid we haven't properly house-broken Ms. Kyle. In the plus column, though, she knows how to brew coffee.
CHIP=>Thanks. Y'know it's not the caffeine that buzzes us -- it's the obedience.
SELINA=>Shut up, Chip.
SELINA=>"Actually more of just a question." You stupid corn dog. Corn dog. Corn dog.
CHIP=>Watch your step, Dad, it's pretty grotesque...
MAX=>I have enough signatures -- from Shreck employees alone -- to warrant a recall. That's not a threat. Just simple math.
MAYOR=>Maybe. But you don't have an issue, Max. Nor do you have a candidate.
MAYOR=>The man who's given this city so much is here, to keep giving. Welcome Gotham's own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.
SELINA=>Darn. Darn.
MAX=>Forgot. My. Speech. Remind me to take it out on Selina. "Santa Claus"? 'Fraid not. I'm just a poor schmoe who got a little lucky, and sue me if I want to give a little back. I only wish I could hand out more than just expensive baubles. I wish I could hand out World Peace, and Unconditional Love, wrapped in a big bow.
A RASP=>Oh, but you can. Oh, but you will ...
MAYOR=>Great idea.
MAX=>But not mine...
PENGUIN=>Deck the halls.
GORDON=>What are you waiting for? The Signal!
THE RASP OF PENGUIN=>Ooh, Batman... You gonna piss on my parade..?
ORGAN GRINDER=>Take that, tannenbaum!
KNIFETHROWER DAME=>Relax. We just came for the guy who runs the show.
MAYOR=>What do you want from me?
SWORD SWALLOWER=>Not you. Shreck.
CHIP=>You'll have to go through me.
FAT CLOWN=>All this courage. Goosebump-city.
MAX=>Son!
CHIP=>Dad! Save yourself!
SELINA=>I probably shouldn't bring this up, but this is a very serious pair of shoes you ruined. Couldn't you have just been a prince and broken my jaw? My body will heal, but this was the last pair left in my size.
CLOWN=>All these innocent bystanders and I had to pick you ...SHUT UP!
CLOWN=>Listen up, Mister Man-bat, you take one step closer and I'll...
BATMAN=>Sure.
CLOWN=>Nice shot, Mister...
SELINA=>You shouldn'a left the other heel.
SELINA=>Wow. The Batman--or is it just "Batman"? Your choice. Of course.
BATMAN=>Gotta go.
SELINA=>Well. That was ... very brief. Like most men in my life. What men? Well, there's you, but ... you need therapy.
SELINA=>Electroshock therapy. What a bargain -- we both feel better.
GORDON=>Thanks for saving the day, Batman. Thanks for making the rest of us look like a bunch of dolts ... I'm afraid the Red Triangle Circus Gang is back.
BATMAN=>We'll see...
MAYOR=>The Caped Crusader. We don't deserve you! They almost made off with our mover and shaker, Max Shreck. But --
MAYOR=>Where is that insufferable sonovabitch?
SELINA=>Honey, I'm home. Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.
SELINA=>Miss Kitty ... Back from more sexual escapades you refuse to share ... not that I'd ever pry. Drink your dinner.
SELINA=>What did you just purr? "How can anyone be so pathetic?" Yes, to you I seem pathetic. But I'm a working girl, gotta pay the rent. Maybe if you were chipping in, 'stead of stepping out ...
MOM'S VOICE=>Selina dear. It's your mother. Just calling to say hello --
SELINA=>Yeah right, "but" --
MOM'S VOICE=>-- "but" I'm disappointed you're not coming home for Christmas. I was looking forward to discussing your life. To hearing just why you insist on languishing in Gotham City as some lowly secretary --
SELINA=>Lowly "assistant". Thank you.
LAME BOYFRIEND'S VOICE=>Selina, about that Christmas getaway we planned? I'll be going alone. Doctor Shaw says I need to be my own person now, and not an appendage.
SELINA=>Some appendage.
SELINA=>The party never stops on Selina Kyle's answering machine ... Guess I should've let him win that last racquetball game.
GRUFF WOMAN=>Selina ... We've missed you at the rape prevention class ... It's not enough to master martial arts. Hey, Elvis knew those moves, and he died fat. You must stop seeing yourself as a vict--
SELINA'S OWN VOICE=>Hi, Selina, this is yourself calling. To remind you, honey, that you have to come all the way back to the office unless you remembered to bring home the Bruce Wayne file, because the meeting's on Wednesday and Max Slavemaster will freak if every pertinent fact is not at your lovely tapered fingertips.
SELINA=>The file! You stupid corn dog. Corn dog. Deep fried! Corn dog ...
PENGUIN=>Hi.
PENGUIN=>I believe the word you're looking for is...A-A-A-A-A-G-H-!
PENGUIN=>Actually this is all just a bad dream. You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
MAX=>My god ... it's true. The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
PENGUIN=>Quiet, Max. What do you think, this is a conversation?
PENGUIN=>We have something in common, we two ... We're both perceived as monsters. But, somehow, you're a well-respected monster, and I am... to date... not.
MAX=>Frankly I feel that's a bum rap. I'm a businessman. Tough, yes. Shrewd, okay. But that doesn't make me a mon--
PENGUIN=>Don't embarrass yourself, Max. I know all about you. What you hide, I discover. What you put in your toilet, I place on my mantlepiece. Get the picture?
MAX=>What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
PENGUIN=>No, just give you a splitting headache.
MAX=>Well it's not working.
PENGUIN=>You big baby! Just blanks. Would I go to all this trouble tonight just to kill you? No, I have an entirely "other" purpose.
PENGUIN=>I'm ready, Max. I've been lingering down here too long. I'm starting to like the smell ... bad sign. It's high time for me to ascend. To re-emerge. With your help, your know-how, your savvy, your acumen. I wasn't born in the sewer, you know. I come from ...
PENGUIN=>Like you. And, like you, I want some respect ... a recognition of my basic humanity ... an occasional breeze ...
PENGUIN=>Most of all, I want to find out who I am. By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name. Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
MAX=>And exactly why am I gonna help you?
PENGUIN=>Well, let's start with a batch of toxic waste from your "clean" textile plant. There's a whole lagoon of this crud, in the back...
MAX=>Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere.
PENGUIN=>What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
MAX=>If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
PENGUIN=>A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
MAX=>Fred. Fred? He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
PENGUIN=>Hi, Max. Remember me? I'm Fred's hand. Want to greet any other body parts? Or stroll down memory lane, with torn-up kinky Polaroids? Failed urine tests? Remember, Max ... You flush it, I flaunt it.
MAX=>You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you. And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
PENGUIN=>You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
MAYOR=>I tell you this, not just as an official, but as a husband and father ... last night's eruption of lawlessness will never hap--
ACROBAT-THUG=>I'm not one for speeches, so I'll just say "Thanks".
THUG'S VOICE=>Hey! Oww!
TV ANCHORMAN'S VOICE=>This morning's miracle... Gotham will never forget.
ANCHORMAN'S VOICE=>That's him: The shadowy, much rumored penguin-man of the sewers, arisen. Until today, he'd been another tabloid myth, alongside the Abominable Snowman and the Loch Ness Monster ...
ANCHORMAN'S VOICE=>But now this odd little man-beast can proudly stand tall, alongside our own legendary Batman.
ANCHORMAN'S VOICE=>Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck, had been on a fact-finding mission in Gotham Plaza...
PENGUIN=>All I want in return ... is the chance to ... to find my folks. Find out who they are ... and, thusly, who I am ... and then, with my parents, just ... try to understand why ... why they did what I guess they felt they had to do, to a child who was born looking a little ... different. A child who spent his first Christmas, and many since, in a sewer.
ALFRED=>Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
BRUCE=>No, nothing, ah ... His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
AGGRESSIVE REPORTER=>The Hall of Records is a public place! You're violating the First Amendment, abridging the freedom off the press --!
MAX=>What about the freedom to rediscover your roots, with dignity, with privacy?
AGGRESSIVE REPORTER=>What's the deal, Mr. Shreck? Is the Penguin a personal friend --?
MAX=>Yes he's a personal friend. Of this whole city. So have a heart, buddy.
MAX=>And give the Constitution a rest, okay? It's Christmas.
ALFRED=>The city's been noticeably quiet since the thwarted baby-napping ... yet still you patrol. What about eating? Sleeping? You won't be much good to anyone else if you don't look after yourself.
BATMAN=>The Red Triangle Circus Gang ... they're jackals, Alfred. They hunt in packs, at night --
ALFRED=>Are you concerned about that strange, heroic Penguin person?
BATMAN=>Funny you should ask, Alfred. Maybe I am a bit concerned.
AGGRESSIVE REPORTER=>So -- Mr. Penguin --!
PENGUIN=>I have a name. It's Oswald Cobblepot.
AGGRESSIVE REPORTER=>Mr. Cobblepot! You'll never get a chance to settle up with 'em, huh?
PENGUIN=>True. I was their number one son, and they treated me like number two. But it's human nature, to fear the unusual ... even with all their education and privilege ... My dad, a district attorney, mother active in the DAR ... Perhaps when I held my Tiffany baby rattle with a shiny flipper, and not five chubby digits, they freaked. But I forgive them.
PAPERBOY=>Penguin Forgives Parents ... "I'm Fully At Peace With Myself and the World ..."
MAN=>Abandoned penguins from the old Arctic World raised him...
WOMAN=>Makes you remember the true meaning of the holiday. The love, the giving ...
BRUCE=>" ... Red Triangle Circus put on a swell show last night, with fierce lions ..."
BRUCE=>" ... Triangle Circus has returned for a two-week ... Kids will love ..."
BRUCE=>Thanks, Alfred.
BRUCE=>It's cold.
ALFRED=>It's vichyssoise, sir.
BRUCE=>Vichyssoise. Supposed to be cold, right?
ALFRED=>Mr. Wayne. Does the phrase "Christmas holiday" hold any resonance for you?
BRUCE=>Listen to yourself, Alfred. Hassling me, yesterday, in my car.
ALFRED'S VOICE=>What about eating? Sleeping? You won't be much good to anyone else --
BRUCE=>I learned to live without a mother a long time ago, thanks.
BRUCE=>" ... Circus is back, with a freak show that may not be suitable for your kids. Featuring a bearded lady, the world's fattest man, and an aquatic bird-boy."
ALFRED=>Why are you now determined to prove that this Penguin -- er, Mr. Cobblepot -- is not what he seems? Must you be the only lonely "man-beast" in town?
BRUCE=>"... Circus folded its tents yesterday, perhaps forever. After numerous reports of missing children in several towns, police have closed down the Red Triangle's fairgrounds. However, at least one freak show performer vanished before he could be questioned."
ALFRED=>I suppose you feel better now, sir.
BRUCE=>No, actually I feel worse.
ALFRED=>Eat up your vichyssoise.
MAX=>Working late? I'm touched.
SELINA=>No, I am. Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning. I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
MAX=>Why, how industrious. And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
SELINA=>Well I figured that your password was "Finster." Your Pomeranian. And it was. And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
SELINA=>Big giant capacitor. And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be -- -- sucking power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of? Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
MAX=>And who ... would you say this to?
SELINA=>Well ... um ... nobody --?
MAX=>... Where did curiosity get the cat?
SELINA=>I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant. A secretary --
MAX=>And a very, very good one.
SELINA=>Too good?
SELINA=>It's our secret. Honest. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
MAX=>I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle. And Interest Number One, is moi.
SELINA=>Okay, go ahead. Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big. I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
MAX=>Actually, it's a lot like that.
SELINA=>For a second, you really frightened --
SELINA=>Help me ... someone ... Miss Kitty ...
MAX=>I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
CHIP=>She jumped. She'd been depressed.
MAX=>Yes. Yes. Boyfriend trouble ..?
CHIP=>PMS.
SELINA=>I don't know about you, Miss Kitty, but I feel. So. Much. Yummier.
MAX=>... I hope nothing--I don't know, "icky" happened to her. Devoured by stray reindeer, or ... Bruce.
BRUCE=>Hmm. Primitive ventilation.
MAX=>Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
BRUCE=>No. No glass on the inside.
MAX=>Weird, huh?
MAX=>I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
BRUCE=>Good time, too. Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
MAX=>Not sure I like the inference, Bruce. I'm pushing this power plant now only because it'll cost more, later. And a million saved is a million earned --
BRUCE=>I commissioned this report. Thought you should see it.
BRUCE=>I'll cut to the chase, Max: Gotham City has a power surplus. I'm sure you know that. So the question is: what're you up to?
MAX=>"A power surplus"!? Bruce, shame on you -- no such thing! One can never have too much power.
MAX=>If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
BRUCE=>Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here. So --
MAX=>Mayors come and go. And heirs tire easily. Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
BRUCE=>I'm not scared of you, Max.
BRUCE=>Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
MAX=>Scared of Oswald, are you? Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
BRUCE=>"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang. I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
MAX=>Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office. If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
WOMAN'S VOICE, OS=>-- wherever he wants.
SELINA=>Preferably some nightspot, grotto, or secluded hideaway ... You look good in a suit.
MAX=>Selina?! Selina ... Selina ...
SELINA=>That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
MAX=>Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
BRUCE=>We've met.
SELINA=>Have we?
BRUCE=>Sorry. I mistook me for somebody else.
SELINA=>You mean mistook me?
BRUCE=>Didn't I say that?
SELINA=>Yes and no ...
BRUCE=>What happened?
MAX=>Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope? Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
SELINA=>Maybe that broken window over there had something to do with it, or maybe not, it's blurry ... I mean, not complete amnesia ... I remember Sister Mary-Margaret puking in Church, and Becky Riley said it was morning sickness. And I remember the time I forgot to wear underpants to school, and the name of the boy who noticed ... Ricky Friedburg, he's dead now ... But last night? Complete and total blur.
MAX=>Selina... Please show out Mr. Wayne.
SELINA=>You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
BRUCE=>No. And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
SELINA=>Well that's a ... long story ...
BRUCE=>Well, I could ... free up some time...
SELINA=>I'm listed.
BRUCE=>I'm tempted.
SELINA=>I'm working.
BRUCE=>I'm leaving.
BRUCE=>Se-li-na.
SELINA=>Pouring myself into my work.
BRUCE=>I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
SELINA=>Oh. "Kyle."
SELINA=>Rhymes with "dial."
CHIP=>You buy this "blurry" business?
MAX=>Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage? Bottom line: she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window. Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry. Yeah -- Oswald, please.
ORGAN GRINDER=>For you, boss.
PENGUIN=>Yeah, what is it? I'm busy up here?
MAX=>Good. Stay busy up there.
MAX'S VOICE=>I got plans for us, below.
PENGUIN=>"Plans." Swell. Later.
FEMALE VICTIM=>Help Bat--
MUGGER=>Now-now, pretty young thing, nice and easy...
FEMALE VICTIM=>Please, don't hurt me, I'll do anything...
CATWOMAN=>I just love a big strong man who's not afraid to show it, with someone half his size.
MUGGER=>Who the...
CATWOMAN=>Be gentle, it's my first time.
CATWOMAN=>Tic....Tac....Toe.
FEMALE VICTIM=>Thank you, thank you, I was so scared...
CATWOMAN=>You make it so easy, don't you -- you pretty, pathetic young thing? Always waiting for some Batman to save you.
CATWOMAN=>"I'm Catwoman, hear me roar."
MAX=>Don't look, Oswald. It's a surprise.
PENGUIN=>A big bag of fan mail? Filthy lucre? Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
MAX=>Ta-da.
PENGUIN=>Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
MAX=>Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows I know. But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
PENGUIN=>Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
JOSH=>Keep the umbrella! Works for you! I'm Josh. Here! Reclaim your birthright!
JEN=>I'm Jen. Stand still while I slip on these little glove-thingies ...
JEN=>Our research tells us that voters like fingers.
JOSH=>Not a lot of reflective surfaces down in that sewer, huh?
PENGUIN=>Still, could be worse. My nose could be gushing blood.
JOSH=>Your nose could ... what do you ...
MAX=>Enough! Everyone ...
MAX=>You're right, we missed the regularly scheduled election. But elected officials can be recalled, impeached, given the boot! Think of Nixon, Meacham, Barry ... Then think of you, Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.
PENGUIN=>Me and that "Jen" chick... maybe we could take a tumble...
PENGUIN=>Wonder if it's worth my time.
MAX=>We need signatures. To overturn the ballot. I can supply those, Oswald.
PENGUIN=>I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
MAX=>Oswald: We need one more thing.
PENGUIN=>A platform? Lemme see ... Stop global warming. Start global cooling. Make the world a colder place. Frigid ...
MAX=>That's fine, Oswald. But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
PENGUIN=>"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot." "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot." "I need you, Oswald. I need you now. That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
PENGUIN=>Ah. You want those lawless, mindless, homicidal imbeciles up there ... you want my old friends ... want them to humiliate the powers that be. Drive the Mayor into a foaming frenzy. You want my hideous cohorts to go haywire.
MAX=>Precisely. But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided. That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
PENGUIN=>... Want 'em to go apeshit. Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies. Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ... Sounds fun. But I ...
PENGUIN=>I got my own ... quest to pursue up here. It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
MAX=>Sidetracked? Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
PENGUIN=>Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
MAX=>Imagine: You'll have the ear of the media. Access to captains of industry. Unlimited poon- tang ...
PENGUIN=>I wanna be the Mayor. I wanna be the Mayor of Gotham City ...
PENGUIN=>Burn, baby, burn.
ORGAN GRINDER=>All this dough... it's burning a hole in my pocket!
FAT CLOWN=>The Ice Rink was torched! The 12th Precinct reports offensive graffiti and a pharmacy heist!
PENGUIN=>Love to get my flippers dirty. Bust someone's skull. Eat someone's pet ... But action must be balanced with discretion ...
SELINA=>An orgy of sex and violence? Count me in, Miss Kitty.
SELINA=>It's the purr-fect cover, for the purr-fect crime.
THIN CLOWN=>I'll blow up this whole --
CATWOMAN=>Oh, for me? You shouldn't have...
SECURITY ONE=>Who is she? What is she?
SECURITY TWO=>I don't know whether to shoot or fall in love.
CATWOMAN=>You poor guys ... always confusing your pistols with your privates ...
CATWOMAN=>You're overpaid. Hit the road.
TATTOOED STRONGMAN=>Before I kill you, I let you hit me. Hit me. Come on, hit as hard as you can. I need a good laugh.
TATTOOED STRONGMAN=>You call that a...
BATMAN=>Admiring your handiwork?
PENGUIN=>Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
BATMAN=>You're not the Mayor.
PENGUIN=>Things change. Hey, good to meet you. We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
BATMAN=>Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
PENGUIN=>Better than you know, Bat-boy.
BATMAN=>What're you really after?
PENGUIN=>Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
BATMAN=>Things change.
CATWOMAN=>Meow.
PENGUIN=>I saw her first. Gotta fly.
CATWOMAN=>Where's the fire?
BATMAN=>"Shreck's." You --
CATWOMAN=>How could you? I'm a woman...
BATMAN=>I'm -- sorry, I --
CATWOMAN=>As I was saying: I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted. Are you listening, you Batman you?
BATMAN=>Hanging on every word.
CATWOMAN=>Good joke. Wanna hear another one?
CATWOMAN=>The world tells boys to conquer the world, and girls to wear clean panties. A man dressed as a bat is a he-man, but a woman dressed as a cat is a she-devil. I'm just living down to my expectations. Life's a bitch -- now so am I.
BATMAN=>A "he-man"? Sure. They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
CATWOMAN=>Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
BATMAN=>I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up. One ...
CATWOMAN=>I can't sleep either, lately. A little link, between us. But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it. That could put a strain on our relationship.
BATMAN=>...four, five.
CATWOMAN=>Who are you? Who's the man behind the bat? Maybe he can help me find the woman behind the Cat. That's not him ... Ah, here you are ...
BATMAN=>-- No --
CATWOMAN=>Saved by kitty-litter. Some date ...
CATWOMAN=>So it's not a corsage. But a burn lasts so much longer. The bastard.
BATMAN=>The bitch.
BATMAN=>Alfred ... Would you bring me some antiseptic ointment, please?
ALFRED'S VOICE=>Coming ... Are you hurt?
BATMAN=>My ego, mostly.
BATMAN=>... Meow.
SELINA=>Morning, Max. Bummer about the store. You insured?
MAX=>I damn well better be. In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
SELINA=>Actually I have to split. Take a "personal day." You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
SELINA=>Those darned exterminators. They swore the machine was ship-shape.
PENGUIN=>I may have saved the Mayor's baby, but I refuse to save a Mayor who stood by, helpless as a baby, while a band of hooligans flushed our fair city down the tubes of debauchery, devastation --
AGGRESSIVE REPORTER=>Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast who's been delighting Gotham, today made his bid to deliver Gotham ... from ruffians who've run riot, and from a Mayor he's called "impotent, inept ..."
PENGUIN=>... inept, indecisive, and ... and too tall. We don't need a tall man to run this town. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. We need a ... compact man who carries a big umbrella. Thank you, all.
VOLUNTEER BIMBO=>Mr. Cobblepot, you're the coolest role model a young person could have ...
PENGUIN=>And you're the hottest young person a role model could have. Here, wear a button.
PENGUIN=>I could really get into this Mayor stuff. It's not about power, it's about ... reaching people. Touching people. Groping people ...
FAT CLOWN=>Hey Penguin, there's a --
PENGUIN=>My name's not Penguin! It's Oswald Cobblepot!
PENGUIN=>Hell, maybe I'll get laid on the campaign trail ... Happy Trails ...
KNIFETHROWER DAME=>Oswald ... someone here to see you.
PENGUIN=>Just the pussy I been looking for.
CATWOMAN=>Chilly in here.
PENGUIN=>I'll warm ya! I got hot mitts --!
CATWOMAN=>Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You see we've got something in common.
PENGUIN=>Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
CATWOMAN=>Batman. The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
PENGUIN=>Huh? You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
CATWOMAN=>My mistake.
PENGUIN=>Are you perchance a registered voter? I'm also a mayoral prospect.
CATWOMAN=>I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
PENGUIN=>Oh, him again. He's already history -- check it out.
PENGUIN=>We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels. Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
CATWOMAN=>He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most. Meaning, us.
PENGUIN=>Y'mean frame him?
CATWOMAN=>You're quick. Mayor Cobblepot.
PENGUIN=>Right on! Batman goes Manson, and the Mayor goes South. Straight into the sewer. Actually it's not so bad down there, I miss the drip, drip, drip ...
CATWOMAN=>Hmm ... Not even in office yet, and already an enemies list ..?
PENGUIN=>Those names are not for prying eyes!
PENGUIN=>Hey, why should I trust some Catbroad? This is the big-time. Are you the real item? Maybe you're just some screwed-up sorority chick who's getting back at Daddy for not buying her that pony when she turned sweet sixteen ...
PENGUIN=>No, don't hurt Gertrude! I was just -- whattaya call it -- "flirting."
PENGUIN=>Thanks. Jeez. Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
CATWOMAN=>You're off the hook, Ozzie. But Batman is decidedly not.
CATWOMAN=>He napalmed my arm. He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
PENGUIN=>Well, a plan is forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
CATWOMAN=>I want in. The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty. Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
PENGUIN=>You just got yourself a deal, Cat-doll.
PENGUIN'S VOICE=>I challenge the Mayor to re-light the tree in Gotham Plaza, tommorow night.
PENGUIN=>He must prove that under his administration, we can carry on our proud traditions without fear. Not that I have any faith in the Mayor... but I pray, at least, that Batman will be there, to preserve the peace.
ALFRED=>Sir. Shall we change the channel to a program with some dignity and class? "The Love Connection," perhaps?
BRUCE=>You're very subtle, "Oswald."
SELINA=>Why are you doing this?
BRUCE=>Selina. Hi. Didn't mean to --
SELINA=>Scare me? No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
BRUCE=>I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
SELINA=>Treat to be here.
BRUCE=>What's the story? Holiday blues?
SELINA=>The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
BRUCE=>And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"? The guy probably prevented millions in property damage.
SELINA=>I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds." How do these hacks sleep at night?
SELINA=>You're not coming to that, are you? "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
BRUCE=>I wouldn't be caught dead. No, it's probably how I would be caught. The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
SELINA=>-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
BRUCE=>You almost sound enthusiastic.
SELINA=>I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
BRUCE=>You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
SELINA=>No darker than yours, Bruce.
BRUCE=>Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
SELINA=>Yeah? Me too...
BRUCE=>... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
SELINA=>"We"? You and...
BRUCE=>... and me. No, that's be me and me. Is that what I said?
SELINA=>Yes and no...
ICE PRINCESS=>The tree lights up, I press the button ... No wait, I press the button and --
ICE PRINCESS=>Who are you?
PENGUIN=>Talent scout.
ICE PRINCESS=>Come in! You know I don't just light trees. I studied the Method. By mail, but --
ICE PRINCESS=>What is that, a camera or something?
PENGUIN=>Say cheese.
SELINA=>I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
BRUCE=>Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
SELINA=>Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend?
BRUCE=>Had one. Didn't work.
SELINA=>What went wrong? Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
BRUCE=>Nope, I told her everything.
SELINA=>And the truth frightened her?
BRUCE=>Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because I had trouble reconciling them. Vicki said.
SELINA=>"Vicki." Ice-skater, or stewardess?
BRUCE=>Photojournalist.
SELINA=>Sure.
SELINA=>Well? Was "Vicki" right? About your difficulty with duality?
BRUCE=>If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
SELINA=>It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're commited.
BRUCE=>Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
BRUCE=>I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
SELINA=>Nor I, on the second.
BRUCE=>What're you doing three dates from now?
SELINA=>Weren't we gonna watch the Relighting of the Tree?
ANCHORMAN=>We repeat ... The Ice Princess has been kidnapped! And it only gets worse ... Commissioner Gordon ... Can you confirm the reports we're hearing, of Batman's suspected involvement in the abduction?
COMMISSIONER GORDON=>The evidence is purely circumstantial. We found this, stained with blood, in the missing girl's dressing room ...
BRUCE=>Selina, I'm just gonna check on those chestnuts, Alfred was roasting ...
BRUCE=>Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza. You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
ALFRED=>Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
BRUCE=>'Fraid I can't. There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
ALFRED=>I will relay the message.
BRUCE=>Alright, thanks.
SELINA=>Alfred! Hi. I --
ALFRED=>Ms. Kyle. Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that --
SELINA=>Mr. Wayne. Bruce. Yes ... Would you tell him for me that I've been going through a lot of changes and ... no, don't say that. Just ... this is not a rejection, my abruptly leaving, it's ... In fact, tell him he makes me feel the way I hope I really am ... no ... If you whip up a sonnet, something -- a dirty limerick ...
ALFRED=>One has just sprung to mind.
MAYOR=>People .. fellow citizens ... There's no need for panic, this can still be a party that Gotham will remember for --
MAYOR=>... incess will be safely ... atman will be brought in for ques ...
BATMAN=>Gotta hurry. I was set up to look like I did this --
ICE PRINCESS=>No sweat, I'll just tell the police I was kidnapped by an ugly little birdman with fish breath.
CATWOMAN=>Did someone say 'fish'?
CATWOMAN=>Yummy, I haven't been fed all day.
BRUCE=>Eat floor. High fibre ...
CATWOMAN=>Hey stud: I thought we had something together.
BATMAN=>We do.
CATWOMAN=>Gotta go, girl-talk, guys keep out!
ICE PRINCESS=>She let me go. I think 'cause I reasoned with her, girl to girl.
BATMAN=>Okay .. just slowly move toward me ... away from the edge ...
PENGUIN'S VOICE=>Look out -- lawn dart!
BATMAN=>No -- don't panic --
CROWD MEMBER=>Batman? Batman pushed the Princess!
PENGUIN=>Bats with wings, do your things ...
BATMAN=>Wait --
COMMISSIONER GORDON=>Hold your f--
CATWOMAN=>You're catnip to a girl like me: handsome, dazed, and to die for.
BATMAN=>A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
CATWOMAN=>But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
CATWOMAN=>You're the second man who killed me this week. But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
BATMAN=>I tried to grab you -- save you --
CATWOMAN=>Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
CATWOMAN=>Maybe it's time to retire.
CATWOMAN=>You said you were going to scare the Ice Princess.
PENGUIN=>And I kept my word! The lady looked terrified.
PENGUIN=>Let's consummate our fiendish union!
CATWOMAN=>I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
PENGUIN=>I oughta have you spayed! You sent out all the signals!
CATWOMAN=>Did I? Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men -- Corn dog!
CATWOMAN=>Me, domesticated? By you? I doubt it! You repulsive... awful... penguin.
PENGUIN=>The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
PENGUIN=>And the wedding's been called off.
PENGUIN=>Maybe this is a bad time to mention it, but my license has expired. Of course, so have you.
PENGUIN=>Batman... I know you're not having a swell time, but lemme tellya: Taking control of your vehicle, mowing down decent people, and laying the bad vibes squarely on you ... makes the hairs in my nose tingle.
PENGUIN=>Just relax, and I'll take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham.
PENGUIN=>Helpless old lady at twelve o'clock high.
PENGUIN=>Ya gotta admit ... I've played this stinking city like a harp from hell!
PENGUIN=>Came this close to a perfect evening! Iced the princess. Blew away Batman. Almost got married. Killed the bitch. This close..!
POLICEMAN=>He'll never fit!
BATMAN=>That's funny...
BATMAN=>Now I'm a little worried....Oh.
MAX=>... So he survived ... C'mon, be a mensch, stand t...
PENGUIN=>He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
MAX=>Point is, listen to them. They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future. If it works, don't fix it...
MAX=>We'll celebrate tonight, at my annual Max-squerade ball. Shreck and Cobblepot, the visionary alliance.
PENGUIN=>When it came time to ensure the safety of our city, did the Mayor have a plan? No, he relied on a man. A "bat" man.
PENGUIN=>A ticking time bomb of a costumed freak who finally exploded last night, spraying this city with shrapnel of shame!
ALFRED=>I'm less worried about this ghastly grotesque... more concerned about repairing the Batmobile. It's not as though we can simply bring it to any old Joe's Body Shop. Is it, sir?
BRUCE=>Hey, who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave? I'm sitting there working, I turn around, it's like, "Oh hi, Vick, c'mon in."
BRUCE=>Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh? Funny, but sort of mysterious...
BRUCE=>"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
ALFRED=>I think I'll take the stairs.
PENGUIN=>You ask, am I up here for personal glory? Ha ... I toiled for many years in happy obscurity, beneath your boulevards ... No, the glory I yearn to recapture, is the Glory of Gotham ...!
PENGUIN=>How can this be accomplished? I know you're all concerned.
PENGUIN'S VOICE=>Hey, just relax and I'll take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham.
PENGUIN=>Wait a sec -- I didn't say that.
PENGUIN'S VOICE=>Ya gotta admit ... I've played this stinking city like a harp from hell!
PENGUIN'S VOICE=>"This stinking city, stinking city ..."
PENGUIN=>Max! Relax! Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this. We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
MAX=>I think you'd feel out of place at my party. You see, it's for winners.
PENGUIN=>Why is there always someone who brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech!?
PENGUIN=>My babies ... Did you miss me?
THIN CLOWN=>Great speech, Oswald. The way you told those rubes the score!
PENGUIN=>My name's not Oswald, it's Penguin! I am not a human being! I'm an animal! A cold-blooded one. Crank the a.c.!
PENGUIN=>I'm glad this happened. I've learned a little somethng: I don't want their "love". Their "love" is false and suffocating. Ah, but their hatred and disgust -- that frees me! Anyway it's too damn muggy up there! Christmas, right? And I'm schvitzing.
PENGUIN=>Where's my list!? Bring me the names!
PENGUIN=>It's time. What I've been waiting for my whole putrid life. They had their chance, they blew it, and now they'll pay ...
PENGUIN=>Oh, what a collosal bill has come due! Gotham will never forget.
PENGUIN=>These are the first-born sons of Gotham City! Like I was! And just like me, a terrible fate waits for them.
ALFRED=>Mr. Wayne ... a reminder: Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck. May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
BRUCE=>I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
ALFRED=>Ah. "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
BRUCE=>You'll never guess.
MAX=>Attention Shoppers...
MAX=>Like this splendid department store, Gotham can quickly bounce back from the tumult of the past days ... So deck the halls, and shake your booties!
JOSH=>Jen, look over there, but don't stare.
JEN=>My god. How rude.
MAX=>Ingenious costume. Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
BRUCE=>Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
MAX=>I am the light of this city. And I am its mean, twisted soul. Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
BRUCE=>It does to me.
MAX=>Yawn.
CHIP=>Selina ... Ms. Kyle... May I have this --
BRUCE=>Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
SELINA=>'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
BRUCE=>No hard feelings?
SELINA=>Actually ... semi-hard, I'd say.
SELINA=>There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding. What say we ...
BRUCE=>Y'mean take off our costumes?
SELINA=>Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
BRUCE=>Same here. So why'd you come tonight?
SELINA=>You first.
BRUCE=>To see you.
SELINA=>That's lovely and I really wish I could say the same, but ... I came for Max.
BRUCE=>You don't mean ... you and Max ..?
SELINA=>This and Max.
SELINA=>Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will. Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top? When he should be six feet under?
BRUCE=>Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge or the jury... I mean, just who do you think you are?
SELINA=>I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
SELINA=>A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
BRUCE=>But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
BRUCE SELINA=>You're ... her? You're ... him?
BRUCE=>The burn I gave you.
SELINA=>The puncture wounds I gave you. Oh god ... does this mean we have to start fighting now?
SELINA=>... What do we do?
BRUCE=>I don't know. Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
GORDON=>A darling couple.
ALFRED=>Yes, made for each other ...
ORGAN GRINDER=>Yes, Virginia, there is an anti- Christ!
PENGUIN=>You didn't invite me, so I crashed!
MAYOR=>What do you want ... "Penguin"?
PENGUIN=>Nothing from you ... "Putz".
PENGUIN=>Right now, my troops are fanning out across town, for your children ... Yes, for your first-born sons ... The ones you left helpless, at home, so you could dress up like jerks, get juiced on Max's Shreggnog...
PENGUIN=>I've personally come for Gotham's favorite son ... Mr. Chip Shreck!
SELINA=>Bruce ... we have to do someth ...
PENGUIN=>You're coming with me, you Great White Dope! To die, way down in the sewer!
MAX=>Not Chip! Please! Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
PENGUIN=>I don't. So, no.
MAX=>I'm the one you want! Penguin, please! Ask yourself: Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you? Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
PENGUIN=>Okay, you have a point. Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
PENGUIN=>Let Knute Rockne live. For now.
DARLING LITTLE BOY=>Finally. The tooth fairy ... What do I get?
CLOWN=>Why, the ride of your life. Hey c'mon, little guy ...
NANNY'S VOICE=>Billy ... If you're not brushing, I'll tell your Mama ...
PENGUIN=>Ooh, this is gonna be good...
PENGUIN=>To cut down a whole crop of Gotham's most promising, before their prime...
PENGUIN=>How do I lure 'em in, you ask?
PENGUIN=>Little "Pied Penguin" action...
PENGUIN=>And you get to watch them all sink, in a deep puddle of your industrial by-products. Then you join them. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
ORGAN GRINDER=>Would'ya hurry up loading those kids already..?
PENGUIN=>This way, kiddies ... Jump right in!
PENGUIN=>So ... Where're the kids? Don't tell me they stopped at McDonald's ..?
THIN CLOWN=>Boss ... he's got a note!
PENGUIN=>"Dear Penguin: The children regret they're unable to attend. Have a disappointing day. Batman."
PENGUIN=>You're the messenger. It doesn't make sense to shoot the messenger.
PENGUIN=>My penguins ... We stand at a great threshold. It's okay to be scared. Many of you won't be coming back ...
PENGUIN=>Thanks to Batman, the time has come to punish all God's chillun ... first, second, third and fourth-born, why be biased? Male and female ... hell, the sexes are equal with their erogenous zones blown sky-high ...
PENGUIN=>Forward, march! The liberation of Gotham has begun!
PENGUIN=>The Grinch just stole Christmas. I'm gonna kill it, barbecue it, chop it up and chew its bones!
BATMAN=>I'm homing in on the signal's origin...
ALFRED=>Ready when you are, sir.
BATMAN=>Got the coordinates. They're --
BATMAN=>As I was saying...
FAT CLOWN=>Ten, nine...
PENGUIN=>The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
FAT CLOWN=>... eight, seven...
PENGUIN=>Silent night, violent night...
FAT CLOWN=>All is shrill, all is blight...
BATMAN=>... 28 degrees west. Shall we?
ALFRED=>Let's dance. Sir.
PENGUIN=>Ah, Gotham. You wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so I'm laying you on a slab!
FAT CLOWN=>Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command. Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
PENGUIN=>But who could've ... no, don't say it.
FAT CLOWN=>My lips are sealed.
PENGUIN=>I'm starting... just starting... to lose my temper, now.
PENGUIN=>I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
BATMAN=>Maybe you're right.
PENGUIN=>But in the end all that counts, is: Who's holding the umbrella?
PENGUIN=>My babies ...
PENGUIN=>Ah, you brought your in-laws. I'm sure, once you get to know them --
MAX=>I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss. Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
CATWOMAN=>Your blood, Max.
MAX=>My blood? I ... I gave at the office.
CATWOMAN=>A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.
MAX=>Let's make a deal. Other than my blood, what can I off--
CATWOMAN=>Sorry, Max. A die for a die.
MAX=>Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
MAX=>You're not just saving one life, you're saving a city and its WAY of life.
BATMAN=>First you're gonna shut up. Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
CATWOMAN=>Don't be naive. The law doesn't apply to people like him! Or us --
BATMAN=>Wrong on both counts.
BATMAN=>Why are you doing this? Let's just take him to the police, then go home together ...
BATMAN=>Don't you see, we're the same... split down the middle... please...
CATWOMAN=>Bruce, I could live with you in your castle forever. Just like in a fairy tale.
CATWOMAN=>I just couldn't live with myself. So don't pretend this is a happy ending.
MAX=>Selina! Selina Kyle!? You're fired! And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
CATWOMAN=>He is Batman, you moron.
MAX=>Was.
CATWOMAN=>You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me. Three lives down. Got enough bullets to finish me off?
MAX=>One way to find out?
SELINA=>Four, five. Still alive.
BRUCE=>Selina ... please, stop ...
SELINA=>Six, seven, all good girls go to ...
SELINA=>Hmm, two lives left. Think I'll save one for next Christmas. Meantime how 'bout a kiss, Santey Claus?
CATWOMAN=>You're the light of Gotham City? So be the light of Gotham City!
MAX=>What're you --
BRUCE=>Se-li-na Kyle...
PENGUIN=>Gotta crank the a.c. Stuffy in here.
PENGUIN=>Without the mask you're drop-dead handsome. So, drop dead.
PENGUIN=>Shit. Picked the cute one. Heat's gettin' to me ...
PENGUIN=>Hey. You ... wouldn't blow away an endangered bird ...
PENGUIN=>You wouldn't shoot me in the back ... would'ya ..?
PENGUIN=>I'm overheated, is all ... I'll murder you, momentarily ...
PENGUIN=>But first, a cool drink ...
PENGUIN=>Of ice-water ...
GORDON=>Think he'll ever forgive us?
MAYOR=>Probably not. But he'll always help us.
BRUCE=>I guess this mean we won.
ALFRED=>Yes, I suppose that we did.
ALFRED=>Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
BRUCE=>Right. Sure. And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
BRUCE=>And women.
