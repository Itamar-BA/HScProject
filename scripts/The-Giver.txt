ASHER=>Toss it back, Jonas!
JONAS=>Asher, have you noticed anything strange about that apple?
ASHER=>That it keeps jumping out of my hands?
SPEAKER=>The recreational period has ended. Please return to your classrooms.
ASHER=>Come on, Jonas.
FATHER=>Who wants to be the first to share feelings tonight?
JONAS=>You go, Lily.
LILY=>Um, I felt very angry this afternoon. My childcare group was at the play area, and we had a visiting group of Sevens, and they didn't obey the rules at all! One of them - a male, I don't know his name - kept going right in front of the line for the slide! I felt so angry at him, so I made my hand like this:
MOTHER=>Why do you think the visitors didn't obey the rules?
LILY=>I don't know.
FATHER=>Where were the visitors from, Lily-billy?
LILY=>Our leader told us, but I - I don't remember. I must not have been paying attention. They were from far. Another community.
MOTHER=>Do you think it's possible that the rules in their community may just be different than our own?
LILY=>I suppose.
JONAS=>You've visited other communities, haven't you?
FATHER=>How did you feel there?
LILY=>Strange. They were learning usages that my group wasn't yet, so we felt... stupid.
FATHER=>I'm thinking, Lily, about the boy today. Do you think it's possible that he --
SPEAKER=>Attention. This is a reminder to male elevens that objects are not to be removed from the recreation area, and that snacks are to be eaten, not hoarded.
FATHER=>Lily, do you think it's possible that the boy simply felt strange, being in a place he knew nothing about?
LILY=>Yes.
FATHER=>Are you still angry?
LILY=>I guess not. I guess I feel a little sorry for him. And sorry I made a fist.
FATHER=>Well, then. I have a concern at work. One of the newchildren in the Nurturing Center was born undersized.
LILY=>What gender is it?
FATHER=>Male. He's a lovely little male, but he isn't growing as fast as he should, and he doesn't sleep soundly. We have him in the extra
MOTHER=>Oh, no. I know how sad that must make you feel.
FATHER=>Well, I'm going to keep trying. I may ask the committee for permission to bring him here at night. You know what the night-crew Nurturers are like. I think this little guy needs something extra.
LILY=>Maybe we could even keep him.
MOTHER=>Of course.
MOTHER=>Lily, you know the rules.
LILY=>Well...
FATHER=>Jonas, you're up.
JONAS=>I-I'm feeling... apprehensive.
FATHER=>Why is that, son?
JONAS=>I know there's nothing really to worry about, and that every adult has been through it. But it's the Ceremony I'm apprehensive about. It's almost December.
LILY=>The Ceremony of Twelve.
MOTHER=>Lily, go get into your
LILY=>Privately?
FATHER=>I'm glad you told us your feelings. You know, every December was exciting to me when I was young, too. Each one brings such changes.
MOTHER=>But, to be honest, for you there wasn't the element of suspense that there is with Jonas' Ceremony.
FATHER=>Well, no. I was already fairly certain of what my Assignment would be.
JONAS=>But didn't the Elders select in secret? How could you have known?
FATHER=>Well, it was pretty clear what my aptitude was. I spent almost all my volunteer hours in the Nurturing Center. Of course the Elders knew that, from their observation. So I expected it, and was pleased, but not surprised, when my Assignment was announced as Nurturer.
MOTHER=>Yes, and I wasn't all that surprised when they announced my Assignment in the Department of Justice either.
JONAS=>Did the community still applaud even though they weren't surprised?
FATHER=>Of course. The selections are very rarely big surprises. What's
JONAS=>I know. Everyone knows that. I just don't know where the Elders might decide to place me.
MOTHER=>There are very rarely disappointments, Jonas. There's no need to feel apprehensive.
INSTRUCTOR=>Inside, every search plane contains a screen on the front panel, where blurbs of heat show up as smears on the radar.
ASHER=>I apologize for inconveniencing my learning community. I left home at the correct time but, when I was along near the hatchery, the crew was separating some salmon. I guess I just got distraught, watching them.
THE CLASS=>We accept you apology, Asher.
INSTRUCTOR=>And I thank you, Asher, because once again you have provided an opportunity for a lesson in language. "Distraught" is too strong an adjective.
LILY=>Oh, look! He's here! Isn't he cute? Look how tiny he is! And he has funny eyes like yours, Jonas!
FATHER=>Lily!
LILY=>I'm sorry for being rude.
JONAS=>I accept your apology, Lily.
LILY=>But look how cute!
LILY=>Maybe he had the same birthmother as you, Jonas.
FATHER=>We must all sign this pledge promising not to become attached to our temporary guest. My plea for the newchild was accepted by the committee this afternoon.
LILY=>I think newchildren are so cute. When I become a twelve, I hope I get assigned to be a Birthmother.
MOTHER=>Lily! Don't say that. There's very little honor in that Assignment.
LILY=>But Natasha, the Ten who lives down the street, does most of her volunteer hours at the Birthing Center. She told me that the Birthmothers get wonderful food, they have gentle exercise periods, and most of the time they just play games while they're waiting. I think I'd enjoy that.
MOTHER=>Lily, for the relatively short period of their lives that they're actually allowed to bear newchildren, that's true. But it doesn't last. When it's decided that their time is up in the Birthing Center, they all become simple Laborers in the Community
FATHER=>Anyway, Lily-billy, Birthmothers never even get to see newchildren. If you enjoy the little ones so much, you should hope for an Assignment as Nurturer, like me.
MOTHER=>When you're an Eight and you start your volunteer hours, you can try some at the Nurturing Center.
FATHER=>Speaking of the Nurturing Center, I took a peek at the committee's advance list of names for next Ceremony's newchildren while I was there today.
LILY=>Father!
FATHER=>I know, I feel a little guilty. But I figured it would help in his nurturing if I could call the little guy by a name.
MOTHER=>What is it?
FATHER=>His name - if he makes it to the Naming without being released, of course - is set to be Gabriel.
LILY=>Baby Gabriel.
FATHER=>I call him Gabe, actually. I whisper it to him if no one else is around.
LILY=>What's his comfort object called?
FATHER=>Hippo.
LILY=>Hippo? What a strange word. Hippo! Hippo!
RECEPTIONIST=>Hello, Jonas.
RECEPTIONIST=>It's good to have some volunteers here today. We celebrated a release this morning, and that always throws the schedule off a little, so things tend to get backed up.
RECEPTIONIST=>Let's see. Asher and Fiona are in the bathing room. Why don't you join them there?
ASHER=>Hi, Jonas!
JONAS=>Your turn, Larissa.
JONAS=>Comfortable?
LARISSA=>This morning we celebrated the release of Roberto. It was wonderful.
JONAS=>I knew Roberto! I helped with his feeding the last time I was here, just a few weeks ago. He was a very interesting man.
LARISSA=>Oh, yes. They told his whole life before they released him. They always do, but, to be honest, some of the tellings are a little boring. When they released Edna last week - Did you know Edna?
LARISSA=>They tried to make her life sound meaningful - and all lives are meaningful, of course - but Edna was a birthmother, my goodness. Then she worked in Food Production for years before coming here. She never even had a family unit. I don't think Edna was very smart.
LARISSA=>But Roberto's was wonderful. He had been an Instructor, on the planning committee. He even raised two wonderful children. Goodness, I don't know how he found the time.
JONAS=>What happens when they make the actual release? Where did Roberto actually go?
LARISSA=>Oh, I don't know. I don't think anybody does, except the committee. He just bowed to all of us and walked through the special door in the Releasing Room, like they all do. But you should have seen his look. Pure happiness.
JONAS=>I wish I'd been there to see it.
LILY=>And then they caught me! And that's how it ended.
MOTHER=>Thank you for your dream, Lily.
FATHER=>I have no dream to report from last night. I don't remember dreaming. Gabe?
MOTHER=>How about you, Jonas?
JONAS=>I did dream last night.
FATHER=>Good. Tell us.
JONAS=>The details aren't clear, really. I think I was in the bathing room at the House of the Old.
FATHER=>That's where you were yesterday.
JONAS=>But it wasn't really the same. There was a tub in the dream, but only one.
JONAS=>Everything was warm and damp. And I had taken off my tunic, but hadn't put on my smock, so my chest was bare.
JONAS=>I was perspiring, because it was so warm. And Fiona was there, the way she was yesterday.
MOTHER=>And Asher, too?
JONAS=>No. It was only me and Fiona, alone in the room. She was laughing, but I wasn't. I was almost a little angry at her in the dream, because it seemed like she wasn't taking me seriously.
LILY=>Serious about what?
JONAS=>I think I was trying to convince her that she should get into the water. I wanted to take her clothes off and get into the tub.
MOTHER=>That's all?
JONAS=>I wanted to bathe her. I had the sponge in my hand. But she wouldn't. She kept laughing and saying no.
FATHER=>Can you describe the strongest feeling in your dream, son?
JONAS=>The wanting. I knew she wouldn't, and I knew that she shouldn't. But I wanted it so terribly.
MOTHER=>Thank you for your dream, Jonas.
FATHER=>Lily, it's time to leave for school. Would you walk beside me this morning and keep an eye on the newchild's basket? We want to be certain he doesn't wiggle himself loose.
MOTHER=>Wait, Jonas. I'll write an apology to your instructor so that you won't have to speak for being late.
MOTHER=>Jonas, the feeling you described as the wanting? It was your first Stirrings. Father and I have been expecting it to happen to you for
JONAS=>Do I have to report it?
MOTHER=>You did. The dream-telling was enough.
JONAS=>Well, what happens? Am I going to have to go away for treatment right before the ceremony?
MOTHER=>No, no, it's just the pills. You're ready for the pills, that's all. That's the treatment for Stirrings.
MOTHER=>Lily, hold still.
LILY=>I don't like the ribbons. I'm glad I only have to wear them one more year. Then, next year, I get my bicycle, too.
JONAS=>There are good things each year, Lily. You start your volunteer hours after tonight's ceremony.
LILY=>And this year, you get your Assignment. I hope you get Pilot, and that you take me flying!
MOTHER=>Come on. I want to get a good seat in the Auditorium.
SPEAKER=>The Naming.
SPEAKER=>Female. Clementine.
SPEAKER=>Male. Bruno.
SPEAKER=>Male. Roberto.
SPEAKER=>The Eights.
JONAS=>New brother!
FIONA=>He's cute, but I don't like his name very much. Bruno.
SPEAKER=>The Nines.
ASHER=>I heard about a guy who was absolutely certain he was going to be assigned Engineer, and instead they gave him Sanitation Laborer. The next day he jumped into the river, swam across, and joined the next community he came to. No one ever saw him again.
JONAS=>Somebody made that story up, Ash. My father said he heard that story when he was a Twelve.
ASHER=>I don't know, Jonas.
JONAS=>Asher, have you ever once heard of anyone - and I mean for sure, not just some story - who joined another community?
ASHER=>No. But you can. It says so in the rules. If you don't fit in, you just apply for Elsewhere and get released. My mother once threatened that she was going to
JONAS=>She was joking.
ASHER=>I know, but it was true what she was saying. Here today, gone tomorrow. She said anyone could really just apply for release. Never seen again.
SPEAKER=>This is the conclusion of the meal break. Please return to the auditorium for the Ceremony of Twelve.
CHIEF ELDER=>This is the time when we acknowledge differences. You Elevens have spent all your years till now learning to fit in, to standardize your behavior, to curb any impulse that might set you apart from the group. But today we honor your differences, for they
CHIEF ELDER=>Let us begin. Number One. Madeline.
CHIEF ELDER=>Fish Hatchery Attendant.
CHIEF ELDER=>Number Four. Asher.
CHIEF ELDER=>Assistant Director of Recreation.
CHIEF ELDER=>Caretaker of the Old.
CHIEF ELDER=>Number Twenty.
CHIEF ELDER=>Number Eighteen. Fiona.
CHIEF ELDER=>Number Twenty-seven.
CHIEF ELDER=>Number Twenty-three.
CHIEF ELDER=>Number Thirty.
CHIEF ELDER=>Martin, thank you for your childhood.
CHIEF ELDER=>I know that you are all concerned. I have caused you anxiety. I apologize to my community.
COMMUNITY=>We accept your apology.
CHIEF ELDER=>Jonas, I apologize to you in particular. I caused you anguish.
JONAS=>I accept your apology.
CHIEF ELDER=>Please come to the stage now.
CHIEF ELDER=>Jonas has not been assigned. He has been selected.
CHIEF ELDER=>Jonas has been selected to be our next Receiver of Memory.
CHIEF ELDER=>Such a selection is very, very rare. Our community only has one Receiver, and it is he who trains his successor. We have had our current Receiver for a very long time.
CHIEF ELDER=>Jonas, the training required of you involves pain. Physical pain. You have never experienced that. Yes, you have scraped your knees falling off your bicycle. Yes, you crushed your finger in a door last year. But you will be faced now with pain of a magnitude that none of us here can comprehend, because it is beyond our experience. We cannot prepare you for that, but we feel certain that you are brave. Finally, the Receiver spoke of a quality, and it is one I can only name, but not describe. None of us here will understand it, but perhaps Jonas will. The Receiver told us that Jonas has a quality. The capacity to see beyond.
CHIEF ELDER=>Jonas, you will be trained to become our next Receiver of Memory. We thank you for your childhood.
COMMUNITY=>Jonas, Jonas, Jonas...
COMMUNITY=>Jonas! Jonas! Jonas!
MOTHER=>You've been greatly honored, Jonas. Your father and I are very proud.
FATHER=>It's the most important job in the community.
JONAS=>But I thought you said the job of making Assignments was the most important.
MOTHER=>This is different. It's not a job, really. I never thought - Never expected... There's only been one Receiver in my lifetime.
JONAS=>But the Chief Elder said that they had made a selection before, and that it failed. What was she talking about?
MOTHER=>That's right. It happened very much as it happened today. One of the Elevens --
JONAS=>What was his name?
MOTHER=>Her name. Not his, it was a female. But we are never to speak the name, or use it again for a newchild.
JONAS=>What happened to her?
MOTHER=>We don't know. We never saw her again.
FATHER=>You've been greatly honored, Jonas. Greatly honored.
THE GIVER=>One: Go immediately at the end of school hours each day to the Annex entrance behind the House of the Old and present yourself to the attendant. Two: Go immediately to your dwelling at the end of Training Hours each day. Three: From this moment you are exempted from rules governing rudeness. You may ask any question of any citizen and you will receive answers. Four: Do not discuss your training with any other member of the community, including parents and Elders. Five: From this moment
FIONA=>I go in here, Jonas. I don't know why I'm so nervous, I've been here so often before.
JONAS=>I understand. Everything is so different now.
FIONA=>Yes. Well, I don't want to be late. If we finish at the same time, I'll ride home with you?
JONAS=>Of course.
VOICE FROM SPEAKER=>Yes?
JONAS=>It's, uh, Jonas. I'm the new - I mean --
VOICE FROM SPEAKER=>Come in.
JONAS=>Oh, please. Call me Jonas.
ATTENDANT=>You may go right on in.
ATTENDANT=>Welcome, Receiver of Memory.
ATTENDANT=>The locks are simply to ensure the Receiver's privacy. It would be difficult if citizens wandered in, looking for the Department of Bicycle Repair, or something.
ATTENDANT=>There is nothing dangerous here, but he doesn't like to be kept waiting.
JONAS=>I'm Jonas.
THE GIVER=>I know. Welcome, Receiver of Memory.
JONAS=>Sir, I apologize for my lack of understanding . . .
JONAS=>. . . But I thought - I mean I think that you are the Receiver of Memory. I'm only, well, I was only assigned, I mean selected, yesterday. I'm not anything at all. Not yet.
THE GIVER=>Beginning today, this moment, at least to me, you are the Receiver. I have been the Receiver for a very long time. A very long time. You can see that can't you?
JONAS=>I can see that you are very old.
THE GIVER=>I am not, actually, as old as I look. This job has aged me. I know I look as if I should be scheduled for release very soon, but I actually have a good deal of time left. I was pleased, though, when you were selected. It took them a long time. The failure of the previous selection was ten years ago, and my energy is starting to diminish. I need what strength I have remaining for your training. We have painful work to do, you and I. Please sit down.
THE GIVER=>You may ask questions. I have so little experience in describing this process. It is forbidden to talk of it. I may neglect to make things as clear as I should, so feel free to ask me anything that may help you.
THE GIVER=>Simply stated, although it's not really simple at all, my job is to transmit to you all the memories I have within me --
JONAS=>-- Sir, I would be very interested to hear the story of your life and to listen to your memories. I apologize for interrupting.
THE GIVER=>No apologies in this room. We haven't time.
JONAS=>Well, I am interested, I don't mean that I'm not, but I don't exactly understand why it's so important. I could do some adult job in the community, and in my recreation time I could come and
THE GIVER=>-- No, no, no. I'm not being clear. It's not my past that I must transmit to you. It's the memories of the whole world, Jonas. Before you, before me, before the previous Receiver, and generations before him.
JONAS=>I - I don't understand. I'm sorry, sir. Do you mean not just the community? Do you mean Elsewhere, too? I'm sorry, maybe
THE GIVER=>There's much more. There's all that goes beyond - all that is Elsewhere - and all that goes back, and back, and back. I received all of those when I was selected, and here in this room, all alone, I re-experience them again and again. It is how wisdom comes. And how we shape our future. I am so weighted with them.
THE GIVER=>It's as if . . . It's like going downhill through snow on a sled. At first it's exhilarating: the speed; the sharp, clear air; but then the snow accumulates, builds up on the runners, and you slow, you have to push hard to keep going, and . . .
THE GIVER=>That meant nothing to you, did it?
JONAS=>I didn't understand it, sir.
THE GIVER=>Of course you didn't. You don't know what snow is, do you?
THE GIVER=>Or a sled? Runners?
JONAS=>No, sir.
THE GIVER=>Really? The terms mean nothing to you? Not even . . .
JONAS=>. . . Nothing, sir.
THE GIVER=>Well, it's a place to start. I'd been wondering how to begin. Move to the bed, and lie face down. Remove your tunic first.
THE GIVER=>Close your eyes. Relax. This will not be painful.
JONAS=>What are you going to do, sir?
THE GIVER=>I am going to transmit the memory of snow.
THE GIVER=>How do you feel?
JONAS=>Surprised.
THE GIVER=>It was exhausting. But you know, even transmitting that tiny memory to you . . . I think it lightened me just a little.
JONAS=>Do you mean - Did you say I could ask questions?
JONAS=>Do you mean that now you no longer have that memory?
THE GIVER=>That's right. A little weight off this old body.
JONAS=>But it was such fun! And I took it from you!
THE GIVER=>All I gave you was one ride, on one sled, in one snow, on one hill. I have a whole world of them in my memory. I could give them to you one by one, a thousand times, and there would still be more.
JONAS=>Are you saying that I - I mean that we could do it again? I'd really like to. I think I could steer by pulling the rope. I didn't know to try this time.
THE GIVER=>Maybe another day, for a treat. But there's no time, really, just to play. I only wanted to begin by showing you how it works. Now, lie back down. I want--
JONAS=>Why don't we have snow, and sleds, and hills? And when did we, in the past? Did my parents have
THE GIVER=>No. It's a very distant memory. That's why it was so exhausting. I had to tug it forward from many generations back.
JONAS=>But what happened to those things? The snow and the rest of it?
THE GIVER=>Climate Control. Snow made growing food difficult, limited the agricultural periods. And unpredictable weather made transportation impossible at times. It wasn't a practical thing, so it became obsolete when we went to Sameness. The hills made conveyance of goods unwieldy, and so . . . Sameness.
JONAS=>I wish we had those things, still. Just now and then.
THE GIVER=>So do I. But that choice is not ours.
JONAS=>But, sir, since you have so much power--
THE GIVER=>-- Honor. I have great honor, and one day so will you. That's not the same as power. Lie quietly now. Let me give you something else. And this time I'm not going to tell you the name of it, because I want to test the receiving. I gave away snow and sled the first time, but you should be able to perceive the name without being told a word.
JONAS=>Ouch!
JONAS=>It's - it's a sunburn. It hurts a lot.
THE GIVER=>I started you out with pleasure. My previous failure gave me the wisdom to do that. You must understand . . . It will be painful, Jonas.
JONAS=>I understand.
THE GIVER=>Get up, now. You may return home; that's enough for the first day. You were in the memories longer than you realize. We'll do much longer sessions in the future.
JONAS=>Goodbye, sir. Thank you for my first day.
THE GIVER=>Do you have a question?
JONAS=>Sir?
JONAS=>It's just that I don't know your name. You say now I'm the Receiver, so I don't know what to call you.
THE GIVER=>Call me The Giver.
MOTHER=>. . . And you slept soundly, Jonas? No dreams?
JONAS=>I slept very soundly.
FATHER=>Well, I wish this one would.
MOTHER=>So do I. He's been so fretful at night.
FIONA=>I looked for you yesterday, so we could ride home together. Your bike was still there, and I waited for a little while. But it was getting late, so I went on home.
JONAS=>I apologize for making you wait.
FIONA=>I accept your apology.
JONAS=>I stayed a little longer than I expected.
JONAS=>You've been doing so many volunteer hours with the Old. There won't be much that you don't already know.
FIONA=>Oh, there's lots to learn. There's administrative work, dietary rules, punishment for disobedience - did you know they use the same discipline wand on the Old, the same as for small children? And there's occupational therapy, and medications, and . . . I think I like it a lot better than school.
FIONA=>Goodbye.
JONAS=>Me, too.
THE GIVER=>Welcome. We must get started. You're one minute late.
JONAS=>I apologi--
JONAS=>I'm one minute late, because something happened. And I'd like to ask you about it, if you don't mind.
THE GIVER=>You may ask me anything.
JONAS=>I think it's what you call "seeing beyond."
THE GIVER=>Describe it.
JONAS=>Just now, outside, it happened with my friend Fiona. Not her, just something about her. I think her hair . . . it was different. Not the shape or - or in length. I don't know. I-I - It just --
JONAS=>It changed. I don't know how.
THE GIVER=>When I gave you the memory yesterday, the first one, did you look around? Did you look at the sled?
JONAS=>Ye-- No. I felt it under me.
THE GIVER=>Lie down.
THE GIVER=>Call back the memory of the ride on the hill, just the beginning of it. And this time, look down at the sled.
JONAS=>Excuse me, but don't you have to place your hands on my back?
THE GIVER=>It's your memory now. It's no longer mine to give.
JONAS=>How do I call it?
THE GIVER=>Well, you can remember last year, or the year you were a Seven or Five, can't you?
JONAS=>Of course.
THE GIVER=>It's much the same. Just concentrate.
JONAS=>I saw it. In the sled.
THE GIVER=>You're beginning to see the color red.
THE GIVER=>Uh, back before the time of Sameness, back in the time of memories, everything had a shape and size, the way they still do, but they also had another quality called color. There were many colors, and one of them was called red. That's the one you're starting to see. Your friend Fiona has red hair - quite distinctive, actually. I've noticed it before myself.
JONAS=>At the Ceremony, I saw it happen in the faces of the audience.
THE GIVER=>Yes - well no. Flesh isn't red, but it has red tones in it. There was a time, actually - you'll see in the memories later - when flesh was many different colors. That was before we went to Sameness. The faces you saw, I'm sure, weren't as deep or vibrant as your friend's hair. We've never completely mastered Sameness. I suppose the genetic scientists are still working out the kinks. Hair like Fiona's must drive them crazy.
JONAS=>The color on the sled, Giver, it didn't change. It just was!
THE GIVER=>That's because it was a memory from when color just was.
JONAS=>It was so . . . Giver, the red was so beautiful! Do you see it all the time?
THE GIVER=>All of them. I see all of them. You will when you receive my memories. You'll gain wisdom, then the colors. And so much more.
JONAS=>Why can't everyone see them?
THE GIVER=>Our people made that choice to go to Sameness. Before my time, before the previous time, and back, and back, and back. We relinquished color when we relinquished sunshine and did away with differences. We gained control of many things, but we had to do away with others.
JONAS=>We shouldn't have!
THE GIVER=>You've come very quickly to that conclusion. It took me many
THE GIVER=>Close your eyes and be still, now. I'm going to give you a memory of a rainbow.
JONAS=>But it's all the same, always! I mean I know it's not important if you put on a red tunic or a blue one, but . . .
THE GIVER=>It's the freedom that's important, isn't it?
JONAS=>Yes. Exactly.
THE GIVER=>Well, consider this: what if you chose wrong with something that is important in the community?
JONAS=>Like if we allowed people to choose their own mate? That wouldn't be safe.
THE GIVER=>Why not? Not safe?
JONAS=>It's . . . Oh, I see. It doesn't matter when it's a child choosing between certain toys, but we can't let people choose their own spouses or jobs. What if they choose wrong?
THE GIVER=>Frightening?
JONAS=>I suppose. They would be stuck in those positions. I suppose we have to protect people from wrong choices.
THE GIVER=>It's safer?
JONAS=>Yes. Much safer.
THE GIVER=>Very well, then.
JONAS=>Lily, did you know that once there really were elephants? Live ones?
LILY=>Right. Sure, Jonas.
THE GIVER=>Come back tomorrow. I'm in great pain today.
ASHER=>What's the matter?
JONAS=>Look . . .
JONAS=>No, nothing. I thought for a minute that they were wilting, and we should let the Gardening Crew know they needed more watering.
JONAS=>Do you advise the Committee of Elders often?
THE GIVER=>Rarely. Not nearly as often as I should. There are so many things I could tell them, but they don't
JONAS=>I don't see why they even need a Receiver, then.
THE GIVER=>They need me. And you. They were reminded of that ten years ago, with the failure of my successor.
JONAS=>Why did that remind them?
THE GIVER=>When the new Receiver failed, the memories that she had received were released. They went . . .
THE GIVER=>I don't know exactly. They didn't return to me. They went out to the community; everyone had access to the memories. It was chaos. They suffered until it subsided as the memories assimilated, but it reminded them just how much they needed me to contain all that pain. And knowledge.
JONAS=>But you have to suffer like that all the time.
THE GIVER=>As will you.
JONAS=>My Instructors in science and technology have taught us about the--
THE GIVER=>Nothing.
THE GIVER=>-- They know nothing.
JONAS=>Giver, what causes you pain?
JONAS=>The Chief Elder told me the memories would bring me great pain. I haven't suffered. I remember the sunburn, but it wasn't so terrible. I have to see you suffer. Maybe if you gave some to me, your pain would be less.
THE GIVER=>Lie down.
THE GIVER=>All right. We'll start with something familiar. Let's go once again to a hill, and a sled.
JONAS=>May I have a relief-of-pain pill, please?
THE GIVER=>I'm sorry.
JONAS=>Why? Why do you and I have to hold these memories?
THE GIVER=>It gives us wisdom. Without wisdom I could not fulfill my function of advising the Committee of Elders when they call upon me.
JONAS=>But what wisdom do you get from pain?
THE GIVER=>Some time ago, before your birth, a lot of citizens petitioned the Committee of Elders. They wanted to increase birth rates. They wanted each Birthmother to be assigned an extra birth, so that the population would increase and there would be more Laborers available.
JONAS=>That makes sense.
THE GIVER=>The idea was that certain family units could accommodate an additional child.
JONAS=>Mine could. We have Gabriel this year, and it's fun, having a third child.
THE GIVER=>The Committee of Elders sought my advice. It made sense to them, too, but it was a new idea, and they came to me for wisdom.
JONAS=>And you used your memories.
THE GIVER=>And the strongest memory that came back to me was hunger. It came from many generations back. Centuries back. The population had gotten so big that hunger was everywhere. Excruciating hunger and starvation. It was followed by warfare.
JONAS=>So you described that to them?
THE GIVER=>They don't want to hear about pain. They just seek the advice. I simply advised them against increasing the population.
JONAS=>What does the word "warfare" mean?
THE GIVER=>You'll learn soon enough. But it means destruction, I suppose.
JONAS=>Destruction? Why - But why can't everyone hold a little bit of the pain? If we all shared the memories, wouldn't the pain be less?
THE GIVER=>Yes. But then everyone would be burdened and pained, and that's not what they want. It's not what they've chosen. We carry the burden for our community. It's the real reason you and I are so honored.
FATHER=>After all this extra time I've put in with him, I hope they don't release him.
MOTHER=>Maybe it would be for the best. I know you don't mind getting up with him, but the lack of sleep is awfully hard for me.
LILY=>If they release Gabe, could we get another newchild as a visitor?
FATHER=>No, Lily-billy, it's very rare that it happens, anyway. It probably won't happen again for a long time. Anyway, Gabriel's release won't be discussed anytime
MOTHER=>Oh, dear. If they're identical, I hope you're not assigned.
FATHER=>I am. I'm next on the list. It's not a difficult decision, though. I'll just look at the birthweight, and simply release the smaller of the two.
JONAS=>Mother? Father? Why don't we just put Gabriel's crib in my room tonight? I know how to care for him. It would let the two of you get some sleep.
JONAS=>I'll come back tomorrow, sir.
THE GIVER=>Please . . .
THE GIVER=>. . . take some of the pain.
SOLDIER=>Water . . .
SOLDIER=>Water . . .
THE GIVER=>Forgive me.
SPEAKER=>Today is declared an unscheduled holiday.
FATHER=>Well, alright!
JONAS=>Asher! Hey, Ash!
OTHER CHILD=>Psssheeewwww!
CHILD=>Bang! Bang! Bang!
CHILD=>You got me!
ASHER=>Blam! You're in my line of ambush, Jonas! Blam, blam!
FIONA=>Attack!
ASHER=>Couter-attack!
ASHER=>Pow! You're hit, Jonas! Pow! You're hit again!
FIONA=>What's wrong, Jonas? It's only a game.
ASHER=>You ruined it.
JONAS=>Don't play it anymore.
ASHER=>I'm the one who's training for Assistant Recreation Director. Games aren't your area of expertness.
JONAS=>Expertise.
ASHER=>You can't say what we play, even if you are going to be the new Receiver.
ASHER=>I apologize for not paying you the respect you deserve.
JONAS=>Asher, you had no way of knowing this, but it's a cruel game. In the past--
ASHER=>-- I said I apologize, Jonas.
JONAS=>I accept your apology.
FIONA=>Do you want to go for a ride along the river, Jonas?
JONAS=>No. I-I'm sorry, no, I . . .
LILY=>I can't wait till the ceremonies in a few months, so I can finally become a Nine and get my very own bicycle. Father's is too big for me. I fell. Good thing Gabe
MOTHER=>A very good thing.
GABRIEL=>Gay! Gay!
FATHER=>Well, I want to get to sleep early. Tomorrow's a busy day for me. The twins are being born in a few days, and early test results are showing that they're identical. I have to get up early, and go confirm what we believe in the morning.
LILY=>One for here, one for Elsewhere.
JONAS=>Do you actually take it Elsewhere, Father?
FATHER=>No, I just have to make the selection. I weigh them, hand the larger one over to a Nurturer who's standing by, waiting, and then I get the smaller one all cleaned up and comfortable. Then I perform a small Ceremony of Release.
GABRIEL=>Bye-bye!
JONAS=>And somebody else comes to get him? Somebody from Elsewhere?
FATHER=>That's right.
LILY=>What if they give the little twin a name Elsewhere, a name like, oh, maybe Jonathan? And here, in our community, at his naming, the twin that we kept is given the name Jonathan, and then there would be two children with the same name, and they would look exactly the same, and someday, maybe when they were a Six, a group of Sixes would go to visit another community on a bus, and there in the other community, in the other group of Sixes, would be a Jonathan who was exactly the same as the other Jonathan, and then maybe they would get mixed up and take the wrong Jonathan home, and maybe his parents wouldn't notice.
MOTHER=>Lily, I have a wonderful idea. Maybe when you become a Twelve, they'll give you the Assignment of Storyteller! I don't think we've had a Storyteller in the community for a long time.
LILY=>I have a better idea for one more story. What if actually we were all twins and didn't know it, and
FATHER=>-- Lily. I think it's bedtime.
THE GIVER=>There are so many good memories.
JONAS=>What's your favorite? You don't have to give it away yet. Just describe it, so I can look forward to it.
THE GIVER=>Lie down. I'm happy to give it to you.
THE GIVER=>What did you perceive?
JONAS=>Warmth. And . . . family. I-It was some celebration, a holiday. Who were the old people? Why were they there?
THE GIVER=>They were called Grandparents.
JONAS=>Grand parents?
THE GIVER=>Grandparents. It meant parents-of-the-parents, long ago.
JONAS=>Back and back and back? So, actually, there could be parents-of-the-parents-of-the-parents?
THE GIVER=>That's right.
JONAS=>But my parents must've had parents, too! I never thought of that before. Who are they?
THE GIVER=>You could look it up in the Hall of Open Records. You'd find the names. But think, son. If you apply for children, then who will be their grandparents?
JONAS=>Well, my parents, of course.
THE GIVER=>And where will they be?
JONAS=>Oh . . . when I finish my training and become a full adult, I'll be given my own dwelling. And eventually after Lily does, then Mother and Father --
THE GIVER=>-- That's right.
JONAS=>They'll go live with the Childless Adults, and they won't be a part of my life anymore. As long as they're still working and contributing to the community.
THE GIVER=>And when the time comes, they'll go to the House of the Old.
JONAS=>And they'll be well cared for and respected, and when they're released, there will be a celebration.
THE GIVER=>Which you won't attend.
JONAS=>No, of course not, because I won't even know about it. By then I'll be so busy with my own life. And Lily will, too. If we choose to apply for children, and get them, they'll never know who their parents-of-the-parents are, either. It seems to work pretty well that way in our community, doesn't it?
THE GIVER=>It works, yes.
JONAS=>I certainly liked the memory. I
THE GIVER=>Love.
THE GIVER=>Yes?
JONAS=>Giver?
JONAS=>I feel very foolish saying this. Very --
THE GIVER=>-- No need. Nothing is foolish here. Trust the memories and how they make you feel.
JONAS=>Well, I know you don't have the memory anymore, so you may not understand.
THE GIVER=>I will. I still have many memories of family, and holidays, and happiness. Of love.
JONAS=>I was thinking that . . . well, I can see that it wasn't a very practical way to live, with the Old right there in the same place, and maybe they wouldn't be taken care of like they should. And the fire burning right there in the room. It was certainly a dangerous way to live, but I was thinking - I mean feeling, actually, that it was kind of nice then. I wish that we could be that way. If only just occasionally. Maybe you could even be my grandparent. It's just - the family in the memory seemed a little more . . .
THE GIVER=>A little more complete?
JONAS=>Mother? Father? I have a question to ask you.
FATHER=>What is it, Jonas?
JONAS=>Do you love me?
FATHER=>Jonas, you of all people. Precision of language, please!
JONAS=>What?
MOTHER=>Your father means you used a very generalized word, so meaningless it's become almost obsolete. And of course our community can't function smoothly if people don't use precise language. You could ask, "Do you enjoy me?" The answer is, of course, "Yes."
FATHER=>Or, "Do you take pride in my accomplishments?" And the answer is wholeheartedly, "Yes."
MOTHER=>Do you understand why it's inappropriate to use a word like "love"?
JONAS=>Yes, thank you, I do.
JONAS=>Gabriel? Things could change. They could be different. They should. I don't know how, Gabe, but they can. There could be colors in the world again. And grandparents. Everyone could have memories. I know you already know about the memories.
JONAS=>Gabe? There could be love.
JONAS=>Giver? Do you ever think about release?
THE GIVER=>Do you mean my own release, or just the general topic of release?
JONAS=>Both, I guess. I apologi- I mean I should have been more precise. But I don't know exactly what I meant.
THE GIVER=>Sit back up.
THE GIVER=>I guess I do think about it occasionally. I think about it when I'm in an awful lot of pain. I wish I could put in a request for it sometimes and just give myself over to its cold embrace.
JONAS=>How do you mean cold? Like the snowy hill?
THE GIVER=>No, Jonas, not exactly. But, either way, I'm not permitted to apply for release until the new Receiver is trained.
JONAS=>Me neither. I can't put in a request for my release. It was in my rules.
THE GIVER=>I am aware. They hammered out those rules after the failure ten years ago.
JONAS=>Giver . . . tell me what happened. Please.
THE GIVER=>On the surface, it was quite simple. A Receiver-to-be was selected, the way you were. The selection went smoothly enough. The Ceremony was held, and the selection was made. The crowd cheered, as they did for you. The new Receiver was puzzled and a little frightened, as you were.
JONAS=>My parents told me it was a female.
JONAS=>What was she like?
THE GIVER=>She was a truly remarkable young woman. Very self-possessed and serene. Stunning eyes. She was intelligent, eager to learn. You know, Jonas, when she came to me in this room, when she--
JONAS=>-- Can you tell me her name? My parents said that it wasn't to be spoken again in the community.
JONAS=>Rosemary . . . I like that name.
THE GIVER=>Her name was Rosemary.
THE GIVER=>When she came to me for the first time, she sat there in the chair where you sat on your first day. We talked. I tried to explain things as well as I could. The whole thing is so beyond one's experience, but I tried. And she listened. Her eyes were very luminous, I remember. I loved her. I feel the same way of you, Jonas.
JONAS=>What happened to her?
THE GIVER=>Her training began. She received well, as you do. She was so enthusiastic. So delighted to experience new things. I remember her laughter . . .
JONAS=>What happened?
THE GIVER=>It broke my heart, Jonas, to transfer pain to her. Five weeks, that was all. I gave her happy memories: a ride on a merry-go-round; a kitten to play with; a picnic. Sometimes I chose one just because I knew it would make her laugh. But she was like you, Jonas. She wanted to experience everything. And she
JONAS=>You didn't give her war after just five weeks, did you?
THE GIVER=>No. And I didn't give her physical pain. But I gave her loneliness and loss. I transferred a memory of a child being taken from its parents. That was the first one. She appeared stunned at its end. I backed off, gave her more little delights. But everything changed, once she knew about pain. I could see it in those eyes.
JONAS=>She wasn't brave enough?
THE GIVER=>She insisted that I continue, that I not spare her. She said it was her duty. And I knew, of course, that she was correct. I couldn't bring myself to inflict physical pain on her, but I gave her anguish of many kinds. Poverty, and hunger, and terror. I had to, Jonas. It was my job, and she had been chosen.
THE GIVER=>Finally, one afternoon, we finished for the day. It had been a hard session. I had to catch up and transfer many memories at one time. I tried - as I do with you - to finish the day with something cheerful. She stood up very silently, then she walked over and put her arms around me. She kissed my cheek. She left here that day and did not go back to her dwelling. I was notified by the Speaker that she had gone directly to the Chief Elder and asked to be released.
JONAS=>But it's against the rules.
THE GIVER=>It's in your rules, Jonas. But it wasn't in hers. She asked for release and they had to give it to her. I never saw her again.
JONAS=>Giver, I can't request release. I know that. But what if something happened? An accident? I know I'm a good swimmer, but what if I wasn't and I fell into the river? A whole year's worth of memories would be released onto the community. And then . . . I - I'm starting to sound like my sister.
THE GIVER=>You just stay away from the river. The community lost Rosemary after five weeks and it was a disaster for them. I don't know what the community would do if they ever lost you.
JONAS=>Why was it a disaster?
THE GIVER=>If you were lost in the river, your memories would not be lost with you. Memories are forever.
JONAS=>The only way I deal with it is by having you there to help me.
THE GIVER=>I suppose that I could . . .
JONAS=>. . . . You could what?
THE GIVER=>If you ever floated off in the river, I suppose I could help the whole community the way I've helped you. It's an interesting concept. I'll have to think about it some more. But I'm glad you're a good swimmer, Jonas.
FIONA=>I can hardly believe we are coming up on one full year of training.
JONAS=>I feel the same way. It certainly has been a memorable year.
FIONA=>For me, too. I've enjoyed it. My training has been--
JONAS=>-- Fiona . . .
JONAS=>Have you started taking your pill regularly? The one everyone has to take. I mean for the Stirrings - I-I mean I'm sorry for asking. I mean I apologize for being rude, but I ask for my training. It has to do with my Receiver training. I'm sorry, I probably should have said that to begin with.
FIONA=>I-I accept your apology, Jonas.
JONAS=>You don't need to answer. I should probably ask - I mean . . . um, sorry. I was just thinking of something from my training that I need to know. I can ask the current Receiver probably. He'll let me know.
FIONA=>Very well . . .
JONAS=>Yes . . .
LILY=>Look at him!
MOTHER=>Lily, finish your meal, then look at him.
FATHER=>Little guy should enjoy it. It's his last night here.
LILY=>Why?!
JONAS=>What do you mean, Father?
FATHER=>Well, it seemed like a good idea to have him spend the night in the Nurturing Center yesterday. He had been sleeping so soundly with you, Jonas. But, unfortunately, it was a disaster. Apparently he cried the whole night. When I got to work in the morning the night crew was pretty frazzled.
LILY=>Gabe, you naughty thing!
MOTHER=>Lily, concentrate on your meal. So, what's next?
FATHER=>Well, obviously we had to make the decision. Even I voted for Gabriel's release at the meeting this afternoon. We certainly gave it our best try, didn't we?
MOTHER=>Yes, we did. A shame.
JONAS=>When?
FATHER=>It's scheduled for a few weeks from now. Tomorrow morning we have the release of one of the twins, so we'll be busy with that. The upcoming Ceremony will probably even push it back a little further. But then it's bye-bye for baby Gabe.
JONAS=>Hello, Giver.
THE GIVER=>Welcome, Jonas. We should get right to work.
JONAS=>Yes, I've been wasting a lot of our sessions with questions about release recently.
THE GIVER=>Not one moment was a waste.
JONAS=>I've just been curious lately, I suppose. Back at my dwelling, my father's been telling us about the the twins at the Nurturing Center.
THE GIVER=>I wish they wouldn't do that.
JONAS=>Release one twin? Well, they can't have two identical citizens around. Think how confusing it would be.
JONAS=>I wish I could watch . . .
THE GIVER=>You can watch.
JONAS=>But they never let children in. Isn't it very private?
THE GIVER=>Jonas, I know you read your training instructions very carefully. Don't you remember that you're allowed to ask anyone anything at any time?
JONAS=>Of course, but--
THE GIVER=>-- If you want to watch a release, you have simply to ask.
JONAS=>Well, maybe I will, then. But it's too late for this one. I'm sure it was this morning.
THE GIVER=>All private ceremonies are recorded. They're in the Hall of Closed Records. Do you want to see this morning's release?
THE GIVER=>I think you should.
JONAS=>All right, then.
SPEAKER=>Yes, Receiver. How may I help you?
THE GIVER=>I would like to see this morning's release of the twin.
SPEAKER=>One moment, Receiver. Thank you for your instructions.
JONAS=>That's my father . . .
FATHER=>Good. I thought for a second they were going to be the same weight. Then we'd really have a problem. But he's six pounds even. You can take him over to the Care Center.
FATHER=>And you, little guy, you're only five pounds ten ounces. A shrimp!
THE GIVER=>Watch . . .
JONAS=>Now he cleans him up and makes him comfortable. He told me.
THE GIVER=>Jonas, be quiet. Watch.
FATHER=>I know, little guy, I know. But the veins in your arms are still too teeny-weeny. All done.
THE GIVER=>When the Speaker notified me that Rosemary had been released, they turned on the tape to show me the process. There she was - my last glimpse at that beautiful child - waiting. They brought in the syringe and asked her to roll up
JONAS=>Is it always like that with release? For the Old? For people who break the community rules three times? Do they kill the Old?
THE GIVER=>Yes. It's always the same.
JONAS=>What about Fiona? She loves the Old. Does she know yet?
THE GIVER=>Your friend is already being trained in the fine art of release. Feelings are not part of the life she's learned.
JONAS=>What should I do? I can't go back.
THE GIVER=>First, I will order our evening meal. Then we will eat.
JONAS=>Then we'll have a sharing of feelings?
THE GIVER=>Jonas, you and I are the only ones who have feelings. We've been
JONAS=>I'm sorry, Giver. I don't mean to be so hateful. Not to you.
THE GIVER=>A plan for what?
THE GIVER=>Very well.
THE GIVER=>The community has depended, all these generations, back and back and back, on a resident Receiver to hold their memories for them. The good, the bad, the unspeakably horrific, and the unbelievably beautiful; all of them. I've turned over many of them to you,
JONAS=>Yes.
THE GIVER=>If you get away, if you get beyond, if you get Elsewhere, it will mean that the community has to bear the burden themselves, of the memories you had been holding for them. A full year's worth of agony and ecstacy.
JONAS=>I'll leave at midnight, the morning of the annual Ceremonies. I'll be careful. No one will see me.
THE GIVER=>As Receiver-in-training, you're held in very high respect already. So I think you wouldn't be questioned very forcefully. There's no nighttime attendant here at the Annex. I'll leave the door unlocked. You simply slip into the room. I'll be waiting for you.
THE GIVER=>Leave your parents a note, telling them that you decided to go on a morning ride along the river. Write that you'll be back in time
JONAS=>They won't mention anything to anyone, because it would reflect on their parenting. And anyway, everyone is so involved in the Ceremonies that they probably won't notice that I'm not there.
THE GIVER=>I'll save and package portions from all of my meals in the few weeks we still have until the Ceremony. I'll give them all to you when you arrive.
JONAS=>Be sure to save plenty . . .
JONAS=>I understand they'll need you.
THE GIVER=>My work will be finished when I have helped the community to change and become a whole.
JONAS=>But don't you want to be with me, Giver?
THE GIVER=>Jonas, I love you. But my role is to stay. You're forgetting my age. I would never make it. I'm drained. Did you know that I no longer see color?
THE GIVER=>We don't know what lies beyond our community and the bordering communities we associate with, Jonas. There may be nothing at all, or there may be serious danger, or there may be everything you're looking for.
JONAS=>There may be love. There may be freedom. I won't find any of that here.
THE GIVER=>Well, then . . . You have the colors now. And the strength. I'll transfer my remaining memories of warmth to you. Also, it's about time I transferred something else to you. I think I've been a bit selfish. I wanted to hold it for myself as long as I could, but you need to understand everything before you go.
JONAS=>What is it?
THE GIVER=>When I was a boy, younger than you, it wasn't the seeing beyond that came to me. It was
JONAS=>What did you hear?
THE GIVER=>Music. I began to hear something truly remarkable, and it's called music. I'll give you some before you go.
JONAS=>No, Giver. I want you to keep that, to have with you, when I'm gone.
JONAS=>Are you sure you're not coming with me?
THE GIVER=>Oh, no! No, I have another place to go. When my work is done here, I want to finally be with my daughter.
JONAS=>Giver! You told me you had a spouse, but you have never mentioned a daughter.
THE GIVER=>Yes. Her name was Rosemary.
JONAS=>There's love out there.
THE GIVER=>Godspeed, my son.
GABRIEL=>Pane! Pane!
GABRIEL=>It's a pane!
GABRIEL=>Oohhh! Oohhh!
JONAS=>I'm starving.
INSTRUCTOR=>Jonas!
INSTRUCTOR=>Jonas, you must learn to use more precise language. You are not starving, that is a gross exaggeration. You simply have some feelings of hunger, because it is time for the midday meal.
JONAS=>I apologize for not speaking precisely, Instructor.
INSTRUCTOR=>I accept your apology, Jonas. As long as you are a part of this
JONAS=>It's called snow, Gabe. They're called snowflakes. They're beautiful . . .
JONAS=>We're almost there, Gabe. I remember this place.
