BILL=>Show me.
TERRY=>That's right.
TERRY=>Yes . . . It's the inner city then?
BILL=>How are you getting along in the city, Mr. Detective? No so good, I'd say. You don't understand our ways. . You haven't done anything since you got here. You haven't solved anything. You have a few clues maybe, but nothing more. This what amazes me. You won't succeed. You can't. You think you're in control right now. You've got the gun. You have no control. In a few minutes "Science world" will be on. The neighbor boy, Riley, will come over. By the end of the show, you will be sitting there but you won't understand any more than you do now, and I'll have the gun on you.
DETECTIVE=>No you won't.
BILL=>Come on in, Riley!
RILEY=>I was workin!

BILL=>Terry! Pick up the gun.
DETECTIVE=>Where are you going? Sit down.
DETECTIVE=>All right . . . but, I'm watching you.
BILL=>Just to the table there for some smokes.
BILL=>Where's your gun, Bud? Why . . . it's right here pointin' a bullet right through your nose . . . and remember . . . behind that nose is that delicate little sack of brains. What a mess that is when it's blowed open . . . so you want to meet Hank Bartells . . . Is that it?
BILL=>Well I knew you were stupid but I didn't know how stupid till now . . . OK . .
DETECTIVE=>Yeah . . . I've been telling Terry here that since I met 'im. I sure do.
TERRY=>Think again.
BILL=>My wife and I are sleeping right outside your door. Don't try to leave . . . rem- ember . . . I have the gun.
ELEANE=>The boy Riley wants to see you in the living room. Be very quiet, Bill's a very light sleeper.
DETECTIVE=>I recognize them.
DETECTIVE=>Who knows about this?
RILEY=>Doctors . . . I've been watching them. They're good people, trying to help Ronald. He's getting too much electricity. though . . . you gotta hurry . . . I've been taking readings.
RILEY=>You and me . . . you gotta get to Hank Bartells fast.
DETECTIVE=>Yeah I know . . . I've been trying.

BILL=>Shut up you two . . . Now stop right there at the gate. GET AWAY!! FILTHY KNITTERS . . . GET OUT!!!
DETECTIVE=>Shut up Terry . . . Nobody's talking to you any more . . .
TERRY=>Watch out around here . . .
DETECTIVE=>Yes.
BILL=>By the way tell the Detective what that ole line is.
DETECTIVE=>The Detective's Motto . . . stay alert . . . concentrate . . . stay clean.
DETECTIVE=>Are there people in there? . . . other than Hank Bartells
BILL=>OK-you guys, let's go . . . come on let's show this Detective what he's missing . . . come on . . . Go

RILEY=>Sorry Terry!! . . . sorry!
TERRY=>Ahh.
DETECTIVE=>You know I did.
TERRY=>Did you ever have an doubt, sucker?
DETECTIVE=>Thank God you're on our side Terry.
RILEY=>Look what I smuggled in!
TERRY=>I don't know why we're laughing . . . This place is the worst. There's people here . . . Yeah . . . but watch out . . . they'll kill you for nothin. A lot of 'em have warts . . . all sorts of diseases . . . God . . . What are we gonna do?
TERRY=>Yeah . . . and then what . . . he's worse than all of 'em put together. What can we do?
DETECTIVE=>Take it easy Terry . . . Let's just not to get caught by any of 'em and find Hank Bartells.
DETECTIVE=>We won't know that till we find him . . . then . . . look? We have to try to save Ronald.
RONNIE=>No.
RONNIE=>No, no!
JOHNNY=>You better not let Dan and Bob see that.
FRED=>We're gonna give you a big shock tonight!
FRED=>I won't. Hey, Ronnie, look at this. This is going to give you more electricity . . . get a BIG SHOCK.
JOHNNY=>They'll be here in a minute, don't worry. Shit . . . what a little worrier.
FRED=>We'll give him something to really worry about tonight.
AL=>You little zit . . . you're going to be all over that stage tonight.
JOHNNY=>Hey, we're just havin' fun.
BONNIE=>Bob . . . Dan
RONNIE=>NO!
JOHNNY=>Shut up, Fred.
MR. BARKO=>Where have you been? Ronnie was calling for you . . . you better get in there and get him ready. Here's your check for this month. It's much smaller than usual . . . we had heavy expenses. You understand that don't you? I'm sure you do. . By the way, we're doing the first two numbers with Electra tonight, I want Ronnie in good shape. Come on . . . go . . .go!
BOB=>We're going to go . . so . . . don't worry, Barko.
DAN=>Then it's tonight? All agreed?
DEBORAH=>My darlings.
DETECTIVE=>All right, let's find a house . . . let's look inside some . . . find one that looks good.
TERRY=>We've got to get off the street. There's all those black coats out to kill us . . . we should find a place to stay inside . . . quick.
TERRY=>Nothin' . . . except that things keep goin' round and round. You got to remem- ber that . . . round and round . . . round and round . . . Get it?
DETECTIVE=>What the hell are you mumbling about now? Tell me.
DETECTIVE=>Get what?
DETECTIVE=>What the hell is there to get?
TERRY=>You don't get it, do you?
TERRY=>Never mind.
TERRY=>Stay down and shut up!
DETECTIVE=>Just shut up.
RILEY=>Oh oh . . . here come some more black coats.
TERRY=>That's why I said never mind. Fresh face . . . Nevermind is nevermind. How would you like it if I started yelling "nevermind" here?
TERRY=>Well whisper then or you'll be lookin' for your arms an' legs all up and down this street, sucker.
TERRY=>Hey, let's have a nice talk about this later.
DETECTIVE=>Terry! Listen! What did you say about everything being a circle?
DETECTIVE=>No . . . NOW . . .
TERRY=>Shut up!
DETECTIVE=>I know.
TERRY=>Where
DETECTIVE=>With Hank.
TERRY=>OK maybe--so?
DETECTIVE=>Did you ever look at those symbols Ronnie gave me? . . . how one of 'em shows a broken circle? . . . Do you remember how mad that Donut Man got when his shoes got untied?
TERRY=>Hey . . . you're not pullin' the symbolic bit on me are you big fella?
DETECTIVE=>Well maybe you're right . . . these symbols are important maybe . . . a broken circle . . . a broken shoelace . . . both the same . . . life is a donut . . . a circle . . . the circle club . . . the circles at the gatehouse.
RILEY=>I think he's right Terry.
TERRY=>OK so how does it help us? . . . wait a minute bud . . . you want to try out your theory?
DETECTIVE=>How?
TERRY=>We wait here for a donut man they . . . they always are tying their shoes . . . you're right about that . . . and they're gettin mad . . . but that day someone pointed the shoelaces out . . . someone yelled "your shoelaces are untied! . . . So you yell it out . . . and we'll see what happens.
RILEY=>You gonna do it?
TERRY-RILEY=>Ready . . . yeah . . . do it!
DETECTIVE=>OK . . . are you guys ready to run.
TERRY=>Yell it now while they're far away.
DETECTIVE=>Yeah . . . Yeah . . . OK I'll give it a try . . .

DETECTIVE=>I don't know . . . It sure worked on them though.
DETECTIVE=>YOUR SHOELACES ARE UNTIED!!!
DETECTIVE=>W ............. O ..............W
TERRY=>Do you think it'll work on Hank?
TERRY=>By God!!
RILEY=>Great balls of fire!!
RILEY=>It sure did.
TERRY=>It sure worked on them.
TERRY=>But will it work on Hank?

I hope those people don't come up here.
WOMAN=>Stay . . . I just have to sleep for a while. I got bad sick yesterday and now I feel weak, I need sleep. Just be quiet so I can sleep now.
DETECTIVE=>Can we stay for a while longer?
WOMAN=>I'm tired. I need sleep.
RILEY=>She's sleepy.
DETECTIVE=>Come on.
WOMAN=>What is it?
TERRY=>Hank Bartells got this city closed in so bad . . . God, I can feel it.
DETECTIVE=>Oh, he's crying about things. Come on

RONNIE=>You wrecked us.
MR. GREEN=>You want any of this stuff?
RILEY=>Black coats.
TERRY=>Oh my God.
DETECTIVE=>Riley . . . take a look.
DETECTIVE=>Riley . . . up you go.
GERSTEIN=>Dance with me.
GERSTEIN.=>Turn around . . . slow.
DETECTIVE=>Please let me leave . . . I have to leave.
GERSTEIN=>Dance with me or I'll stab you and kill you.
DETECTIVE=>We're trying to leave here. Please let us go.
GERSTEIN=>This is nice.
GERSTEIN=>Feel me.
GERSTEIN=>In a minute . Feel me quick . . . do it . . .
STEVE=>Gerstein? . . . it's Steve . . . get out here, we're going.
STEVE=>Hey, come on, get out here. Come out here!!
DETECTIVE=>It's a dream . . . Let's get out of here
TERRY.=>What is it?
RILEY=>It's open . . . let's go!!
GERSTEIN=>I'm coming now!!
RILEY-TERRY=>What's that?
DETECTIVE=>Damn dogs are everywhere.
DETECTIVE=>It's happening
TERRY=>Dogs, black coats, donut men - Hank Bartells . . . Hey we're in trouble.
DETECTIVE=>Come on . . . It's those friends of Ronald's . . . hurry . . . It's Bob! and Dan! and Deborah!
DETECTIVE=>I am a Detective . . . this is Terry and Riley, my friends we are all friends of Ronald's but we're the only friends in this area of the city . . . You're in the inner city now .
DAN=>Everything's on fire . . . this is the only place that's left.
TERRY=>Things are really comin' apart.
DETECTIVE=>You're Bob and Dan and Deborah.
TERRY=>It is? Who are they?
RILEY=>You said it.
BOB=>We were shot.
DEBORAH=>Where is Ronnie?
DETECTIVE=>Well . . . he's around.
TER.RY=>Yeah but . . . yeah but . . .
DAN=>There's a lot of electricity around here.
DETECTIVE=>Look . . . just don't lose conscious- ness . . . Terry, you better give 'em some pins or something.
DAN=>It looks like everything is reversed . . . we thought this but . . . say Bob . . . I think we were right . . . there's a different kind of electricity.
RILEY=>It's a deflector I built . . . single phase . . . cuts through anything . . . you wanta see it?
BOB=>What's that? .
BOB=>Snag that line up there and check the polarities will ya Riley . . . let me
DEBORAH=>What is happening?
BOB AND DAN=>Yes . . .
BOB=>Me neither.
RILEY=>Sure.
DAN=>I must have seen him draw these a hundred times but never gave it a second thought.
TERRY=>You better show Bob and Dan those symbols.
DEBORAH=>He was trying to tell us something . . . This is the most unfortunate thing that parents sometimes do not listen to the small words of their children.
DETECTIVE=>This symbol is a circle and it is followed by this configuration. We want this . . . the broken circle . . . so we need this configuration.
DAN=>The triangle needs reversing. I've heard of triangulation and I suppose it too has contrasting possibilities . . .
DETECTIVE=>There is . . . His name is Hank Bartells . . . he's somewhere here . . . possibly in that power station.
DAN=>I think there has to be some strong inter- ference here.
BOB=>You mean . . . You mean . . . Hey . . . there's a triangulator in there and it's
RILEY=>All my readings indicate he's there . . .
DEBORAH=>Oh . . . can you make it right?
DAN=>Right Bob . . . and the circles are getting smaller.
TERRY=>He's the only one who has a chance confronting Hank . . . We'd be useless up close . . . Is there anyway that you could make that power reverse from out here . . .
TERRY=>There's one helluva great big problem here . . . cause the closer anyone gets to that power station the harder it is to think . . . There's rumors that a person forgets his own name in there . . . . Can you still stand on one leg . . . try it . . . try to stand on one leg.
DAN=>I don't think so . . . there's a tri- angular set in there and someone has to get to it and turn it around 180*.
MR. BARKO=>See, the kid's doing fine.
MR. BARKO=>Whatdya mean? Whatdya mean?-
DOCTOR=>I'll try to do something for him, but I don't know how.
MR. BARKO=>I told you to watch them . . . see what they did!!!
DOCTOR=>I told you I didn't know how Pink and Platinum did this. He's dying I'm telling you!! I can't figure out what they did.
MR. BARKO=>All right, he can rest for a while, maybe a few days.
DOCTOR=>I don't know how he works!!! Maybe just let him rest.
MR. BARKO=>A few days.
MR. BARKO=>Whatdya think?
DOCTOR=>Maybe a few weeks.
BOB=>Dan?
BOB=>This is what I meant!
DAN=>Yeah Bob?
DAN=>We'll interrupt the power every 15 minutes!!!
BOB=>If we use Riley's box there . . . and tie into these lines using the negative of our RZ patterns . . . .
DAN=>It means that if the Detective can get in there and find that triangulator we can cut Hank's power by fifty percent every fifteen minutes. It may mean that he will be clear enough to think and act during that time.
DETECTIVE=>Its a long story but, if his shoes are untied and if he knows it, he might get real mad and if he does it'll cut his power even more.
DEBORAH=>Bobby!! What does it mean?
BOB=>That's good.
DAN=>What's that?
DEBORAH=>And then what?
DETECTIVE=>Let's go.
TERRY=>The Detective and I will go it alone from there.
RILEY=>It'll be a whole new ball game if we get that far.
DAN=>We'll get as close as possible to tap in . . .
TERRY=>One more thing . . . when we go in . . . we're gonna be loaded with needles and pins!! We gotta be!! OK?
DETECTIVE=>Good luck to us all.
RONNIE=>Bob? . . . Dan?
BOB=>Good luck to you.
ALL=>OK.
RONNIE=>Bob? . . . Dan?
JOHNNY=>Hey, let's get outta here anyway. I can't breathe in here.
AL=>I can't breathe in here either. Let's go.
MR. BARKO=>We've had a little trouble, but he'll be there . . . don't worry. We're going to go all out. That little bastard's going to do the show of his life even if it kills him. Everyone thinks he's slacked off? Well, just wait. He'll be there with bells on. Ronnie Rocket will be there. You tell 'em. The little bastard will be there with bells on.
CLEANING LADY=>Get away from him . . . get on out of here . . . OUT!! OUT!!
