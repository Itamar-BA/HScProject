ARTHUR=>Whoa there!
SOLDIER=>Halt! Who goes there?
ARTHUR=>It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
SOLDIER=>Get away!
ARTHUR=>I am... And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot.. I must speak with your lord and master.
SOLDIER=>What? Ridden on a horse?
ARTHUR=>Yes!
SOLDIER=>You're using coconuts!
ARTHUR=>...What?
SOLDIER=>You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
ARTHUR=>So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
SOLDIER=>Where did you get the coconuts?
ARTHUR=>Through ... We found them.
SOLDIER=>Found them? In Mercea. The coconut's tropical!
ARTHUR=>What do you mean?
SOLDIER=>Well, this is a temperate zone.
ARTHUR=>The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
SOLDIER=>Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
ARTHUR=>Not at all. They could be carried.
SOLDIER=>What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
ARTHUR=>Why not?
SOLDIER=>I'll tell you why not ... because a swallow is about eight inches long and weighs five ounces, and you'd be lucky to find a coconut under a pound.
ARTHUR=>It could grip it by the husk ...
SOLDIER=>It's not a question of where he grips it, It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ... A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
ARTHUR=>Well, it doesn't matter. Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
SOLDIER=>Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second. right?
ARTHUR=>Please!
SOLDIER=>Am I right?
ARTHUR=>I'm not interested.
SECOND SOLDIER=>It could be carried by an African swallow!
FIRST SOLDIER=>Oh yes! An African swallow maybe ... but not a European swallow. that's my point.
SECOND SOLDIER=>Oh yes, I agree there ...
ARTHUR=>Will you ask your master if he wants to join the Knights of Camelot?!
FIRST SOLDIER=>But then of course African swallows are non-migratory.
SECOND SOLDIER=>Oh yes.
FIRST SOLDIER=>So they wouldn't be able to bring a coconut back anyway.
FIRST SOLDIER=>No, they'd have to have it on a line.
CART DRIVER=>Bring out your dead!
CART DRIVER=>Bring out your dead!
LARGE MAN=>Here's one!
CART DRIVER=>Ninepence.
BODY=>I'm not dead!
CART DRIVER=>What?
LARGE MAN=>Nothing... There's your ninepence.
BODY=>I'm not dead!
CART DRIVER=>'Ere. He says he's not dead.
LARGE MAN=>Yes he is.
BODY=>I'm not!
CART DRIVER=>He isn't.
LARGE MAN=>He will be soon. He's very ill.
BODY=>I'm getting better!
LARGE MAN=>You're not. You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
CART DRIVER=>I can't take him like this. It's against regulations.
BODY=>I don't want to go on the cart.
LARGE MAN=>Don't be such a baby.
CART DRIVER=>I can't take him.
BODY=>I feel fine.
LARGE MAN=>Do me a favour.
CART DRIVER=>I can't.
LARGE MAN=>Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes. He won't be long.
CART DRIVER=>I promised I'd be at the Robinson's. They've lost nine today.
LARGE MAN=>When's your next round?
CART DRIVER=>Thursday.
BODY=>I think I'll go for a walk.
LARGE MAN=>You're not fooling anyone you know. Isn't there anything you could do?
BODY=>I feel happy... I feel happy.
LARGE MAN=>Thanks very much.
CART DRIVER=>That's all right. See you on Thursday.
LARGE MAN=>Who's that then?
CART DRIVER=>I dunno, Must be a king.
LARGE MAN=>Why?
CART DRIVER=>He hasn't got shit all over him.
ARTHUR=>Old woman!
DENNIS=>Man!
ARTHUR=>Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
DENNIS=>I'm thirty-seven.
ARTHUR=>What?
DENNIS:=>I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
ARTHUR:=>Well - I can't just say: "Hey, Man!'
DENNIS=>Well you could say: "Dennis"
ARTHUR=>I didn't know you were called Dennis.
DENNIS=>You didn't bother to find out, did you?
ARTHUR=>I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
DENNIS=>What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
ARTHUR=>Well ... I AM king.
DENNIS=>Oh, very nice. King, eh! I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food. And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society! If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
OLD WOMAN=>Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ... Oh! how d'you do?
ARTHUR=>How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
OLD WOMAN=>King of the WHO?
ARTHUR=>The Britons.
OLD WOMAN=>Who are the Britons?
ARTHUR=>All of us are ... we are all Britons.
OLD WOMAN=>Ooooh! I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective ...
DENNIS=>You're fooling yourself. We're living in a dictatorship, A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes ...
OLD WOMAN=>There you are, bringing class into it again ...
DENNIS=>That's what it's all about ... If only -
ARTHUR=>Please, please good people. I am in haste. What knight lives in that castle?
OLD WOMAN=>No one live there.
ARTHUR=>Well, who is your lord?
OLD WOMAN=>We don't have a lord.
ARTHUR=>What?
DENNIS=>I told you, We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune, we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
ARTHUR=>Yes.
DENNIS=>... But all the decision of that officer ...
ARTHUR=>Yes, I see.
DENNIS=>... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
ARTHUR=>Be quiet!
DENNIS=>... but a two-thirds majority ...
ARTHUR=>Be quiet! I order you to shut up.
OLD WOMAN=>Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
ARTHUR=>I am your king!
OLD WOMAN=>Well, I didn't vote for you.
ARTHUR=>You don't vote for kings.
OLD WOMAN=>Well, how did you become king, then?
ARTHUR=>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ... that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king!
OLD WOMAN=>Is Frank in? He'd be able to deal with this one.
DENNIS=>Look, strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
ARTHUR=>Be quiet!
DENNIS=>You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
ARTHUR=>Shut up!
DENNIS=>I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
ARTHUR=>Shut up, will you. Shut up!
DENNIS=>Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
ARTHUR=>Shut up!
DENNIS=>Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
ARTHUR=>Bloody peasant!
DENNIS=>Oh, Did you hear that! What a give-away.
ARTHUR=>Come on, patsy.
DENNIS=>did you see him repressing me, then? That's what I've been on about ...
ARTHUR=>You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.
BLACK KNIGHT=>Who dares to challenge the Black Knight?
ARTHUR=>I do not challenge you.
ARTHUR=>I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
ARTHUR=>You have proved yourself worthy. ... Will you join me?
ARTHUR=>A man of your strength and skill would be the chief of all my knights ...
BLACK KNIGHT=>Never.
ARTHUR=>You make me sad. But so be it. Come Patsy.
BLACK KNIGHT=>None shall pass.
ARTHUR=>What?
BLACK KNIGHT=>None shall pass.
ARTHUR=>I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
BLACK KNIGHT=>Then you shall die.
ARTHUR=>I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
BLACK KNIGHT=>I move for no man.
ARTHUR=>So be it!
ARTHUR=>Now stand aside worthy adversary.
BLACK KNIGHT=>'Tis but a scratch.
ARTHUR=>A scratch? Your arm's off.
BLACK KNIGHT=>No, it isn't.
ARTHUR=>Well, what's that then?
BLACK KNIGHT=>I've had worse.
ARTHUR=>You're a liar.
BLACK KNIGHT=>Come on you pansy!
ARTHUR=>Victory is mine. I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
BLACK KNIGHT=>Come on then.
ARTHUR=>What?
ARTHUR=>You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
BLACK KNIGHT=>Had enough?
ARTHUR=>You stupid bastard. You havn't got any arms left.
BLACK KNIGHT=>Course I have.
ARTHUR=>Look!
BLACK KNIGHT=>What! Just a flesh wound.
ARTHUR=>Stop that.
BLACK KNIGHT=>Had enough ... ?
ARTHUR=>I'll have your leg.
BLACK KNIGHT=>I'll do you for that.
ARTHUR=>You'll what ... ?
BLACK KNIGHT=>Come Here.
ARTHUR=>What are you going to do. bleed on me?
BLACK KNIGHT=>I'm invincible!
ARTHUR=>You're a looney.
BLACK KNIGHT=>The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
BLACK KNIGHT=>All right, we'll call it a draw.
ARTHUR=>Come, Patsy.
BLACK KNIGHT=>Running away eh? You yellow bastard, Come back here and take what's coming to you. I'll bite your legs off!
FIRST VILLAGER=>We have found a witch. May we burn her?
ALL=>A Witch! Burn her!
BEDEVERE=>How do you know she is a witch?
ALL=>She looks like one. Yes, she does.
BEDEVERE=>Bring her forward.
WITCH=>I am not a witch. I am not a witch.
BEDEVERE=>But you are dressed as one.
WITCH=>They dressed me up like this.
ALL=>We didn't, we didn't!
WITCH=>This is not my nose, It is a false one.
BEDEVERE=>Well?
FIRST VILLAGER=>... Well, we did do the nose.
BEDEVERE=>The nose?
FIRST VILLAGER=>And the hat. But she is a witch.
ALL=>A witch, a witch, burn her!
BEDEVERE=>Did you dress her up like this?
FIRST VILLAGER=>... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
BEDEVERE=>Why do you think she is a witch?
SECOND VILLAGER=>She turned me into a newt.
BEDEVERE=>A newt?
SECOND VILLAGER=>I got better.
ALL=>Burn her anyway.
BEDEVERE=>Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
ALL=>There are? Tell up. What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
BEDEVERE=>Tell me ... what do you do with witches?
ALL=>Burn them.
BEDEVERE=>And what do you burn, apart from witches?
FOURTH VILLAGER=>... Wood?
BEDEVERE=>So why do witches burn?
SECOND VILLAGER=>... Because they're made of wood...?
BEDEVERE=>Good.
ALL=>I see. Yes, of course.
BEDEVERE=>So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
FIRST VILLAGER=>Make a bridge out of her.
BEDEVERE=>Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
ALL=>Ah. Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
BEDEVERE=>Does wood sink in water?
ALL=>No, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her. To the pond.
BEDEVERE=>Wait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
ALL=>Bread? No, no, no. Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
ARTHUR=>A duck.
BEDEVERE=>Exactly. So... logically ...
FIRST VILLAGER=>If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
BEDEVERE=>And therefore?
ALL=>A witch! ... A duck! A duck! Fetch a duck.
FOURTH VILLAGER=>Here is a duck, Sir Bedevere.
BEDEVERE=>We shall use my largest scales.
BEDEVERE=>Remove the supports.
ALL=>A witch! A witch!
WITCH=>It's a fair cop.
BEDEVERE=>Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
ARTHUR=>I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
BEDEVERE=>My liege ... forgive me ...
ARTHUR=>Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
BEDEVERE=>My liege, I am honored.
ARTHUR=>What is your name?
BEDEVERE=>Bedevere, my Liege.
ARTHUR=>Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
VOICE OVER=>And so King Arthur gathered his knights together ... bringing from all the corners of the kingdom the strongest and bravest in the land ... To sit at The Round Table ...
VOICE OVER=>The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights ... but other illustrious names were soon to follow ...
VOICE OVER=>Sir Launcelot the Brave ...
VOICE OVER=>Sir Galahad the Pure ...
VOICE OVER=>And Sir Robin-the-not-quite-so-pure-as-Sir-Launcelot ...
VOICE OVER=>... Who had nearly fought the Dragon of Agnor ...
VOICE OVER=>... Who had nearly stood up to to the vicious Chicken of Bristol ...
VOICE OVER=>... and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill ... and the aptly named ...
VOICE OVER=>Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.
VOICE OVER=>Together they formed band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries ... The Knights of the Round Table ...
BEDEVERE=>And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
ARTHUR=>This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
BEDEVERE=>OF course, my Liege ...
LAUNCELOT=>Look, my liege!
ARTHUR=>Camelot!
GALAHAD=>Camelot ...
LAUNCELOT=>Camelot ...
GAWAIN=>It's only a model.
ARTHUR=>Sh! Knights! I bid you welcome to your new home! Let us ride ... to Camelot.
KNIGHTS=>We're knights of the round table We dance whene'er we're able We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable. We dine well here in Camelot We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.
SINGLE MAN=>I have to push the pram a lot.
ARTHUR=>No, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.
KNIGHTS=>Right!
ARTHUR=>It is a silly place.
GOD=>Arthur! Arthur ... King of the Britons ...
ARTHUR=>Sorry ...
GOD=>And don't apologize. Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
ARTHUR=>I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
GOD=>Well, don't. I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms. they're so depressing. Now knock it of
ARTHUR=>Yes, Lord.
GOD=>Right. Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
ARTHUR=>Good idea, O Lord!
GOD=>Course it's a good idea.
LAUNCELOT=>A Blessing. A blessing from the lord.
BEDEVERE=>Praise be to God!
ARTHUR=>We have a task, we must waste no time! To Camelot!
GALAHAD=>God be praised!
ARTHUR=>Hello.
MAN=>'Allo. Whoo is eet?
ARTHUR=>I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table. Whose castle is this?
MAN=>This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
ARTHUR=>Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest, and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
MAN=>Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
ARTHUR=>What?
GALAHAD=>He says they've already got one!
ARTHUR=>Are you sure he's got one?
MAN=>Oh yes. It's very nice
MAN=>I told him we already got one.
ARTHUR=>Well ... can we come up and have a look?
MAN=>Of course not! You are English pigs.
ARTHUR=>Well, what are you then?
MAN=>I'm French. Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
GALAHAD=>What are you doing in England?
MAN=>Mind your own business.
ARTHUR=>If you will not show us the Grail we shall storm your castle.
MAN=>You don't frighten us, English pig-dog! Go and boil your bottoms, son of a silly person. I blow my nose on you, so-called Arthur-king, you and your silly English K...kaniggets.
GALAHAD=>What a strange person.
ARTHUR=>Now look here, my good man!
MAN=>I don't want to talk to you, no more, you empty-headed animal, food trough wiper. I fart in your general direction. You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.
GALAHAD=>Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
MAN=>No. Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time.
ARTHUR=>Now this is your last chance. I've been more than reasonab...
MAN=>Fetchez la vache!
GUARD=>Quoi?
MAN=>Fetchez la vache!
ARTHUR=>Now that is my final offer. If you are not prepared to agree to my demands I shall be forced to take ... Oh Christ!
ROBIN=>What a cruel thing to do.
BEDEVERE=>It hadn't even been milked.
ARTHUR=>Right! Knights! Forward!
ARTHUR=>Knights! Run away!
LAUNCELOT=>The sods! I'll tear them apart.
ARTHUR=>No!
BEDEVERE=>I have a plan sir.
ARTHUR=>Now what happens?
BEDEVERE=>Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
ARTHUR=>Who ... Who breaks out?
BEDEVERE=>Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ... leap out of the rabbit and ...
BEDEVERE=>Look, if we were to build a large wooden badger...
ARTHUR=>Run away!
SIR GAWAIN=>It's only a model.
ARTHUR=>Sh!
HISTORIAN'S SPEECH=>Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur ... The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion. Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. Now, this is what they did. No sooner...
MRS HISTORIAN=>FRANK!
ROBIN=>Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
SINGERS=>Brave, Sir Rob ...
ROBIN=>Shut up.
ROBIN=>Morning.
ONE LADY=>Bye.
THREE HEADS=>Halt! Who art thou?
SINGERS=>He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
ROBIN=>Shut up. Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
THREE HEADS=>What do you want?
SINGERS=>To fight and ...
ROBIN=>Shut up. Nothing really. just to pass through, good Sir knight.
THREE HEADS=>I'm afraid not. This is my bit of the forest. Find your own bit.
ROBIN=>I am a Knight of King Arthur's Round Table. I seek the Holy Grail - Stand aside and let me pass.
THREE HEADS=>You are a Knight of the Round Table?
ROBIN=>I am.
SECOND HEAD=>Shit.
FIRST HEAD=>In that case I shall have to kill you.
SECOND HEAD=>Shall I?
THIRD HEAD=>Oh, I don't think so.
SECOND HEAD=>I'm not sure.
MIDDLE HEAD=>What do I think?
LEFT HEAD=>I think kill him.
SECOND HEAD=>I'm still not sure.
THIRD HEAD=>All right. How many of me think I should kill him?
FIRST HEAD=>I do.
THIRD HEAD=>One.
SECOND HEAD=>That's not a quorum.
FIRST HEAD=>It is if I'm the Chairman.
THIRD HEAD=>Oo, it's not.
SECOND HEAD=>I'm the Chairman this week.
FIRST HEAD=>You're not.
SECOND HEAD=>Look, it'll make it much simpler if I vote with me.
THIRD HEAD=>To kill him.
SECOND HEAD=>Yeah.
THIRD HEAD=>Oh, damn.
FIRST HEAD=>Knight, I have decided to kill you.
THIRD HEAD=>With one absenting.
FIRST HEAD=>Knight, I have decided to kill you with one absenting.
THIRD HEAD=>Sorry about this but I have to be fair.
ROBIN=>Oh, that's all right. So you are going to kill me with your big axe.
FIRST HEAD=>Er no, with my sword.
SECOND HEAD=>Dagger.
THIRD HEAD=>Mace is quicker.
FIRST HEAD=>No, no, the sword, it's easier.
THIRD HEAD=>He said axe.
ROBIN=>Look, hurry up six eyes, or I shall cut your head off.
THIRD HEAD=>For God's sake, CUT that one off, and do us all a favour.
FIRST HEAD=>What do you mean?
THIRD HEAD=>Yapping on all the time.
SECOND HEAD=>You're lucky, you're not next to him.
THIRD HEAD=>What do you mean?
SECOND HEAD=>You snore.
THIRD HEAD=>Oo, lies. Anyway, you've got bad breath.
SECOND HEAD=>I haven't.
SECOND HEAD=>It's not my fault. It's what you both eat.
FIRST HEAD=>Look, stop this bitching. We've got a knight to kill.
SECOND HEAD=>He's buggered off.
THIRD HEAD=>So he has. He's scarpered.
FIRST HEAD=>That's all your fault.
THIRD HEAD=>No, it's not.
FIRST HEAD=>Take that.
SECOND HEAD=>Ow.
FIRST HEAD=>I'm sorry.
THIRD HEAD=>'Ere, stop it. I'll teach you.
MAIDEN=>I suppose we're lucky he's only got three heads.
LOVELY=>Chance would be a fine thing.
THIRD HEAD=>Oh! let's be nice to him.
FIRST HEAD=>Oh shut up.
ROBIN=>Perhaps I could ...
FIRST HEAD=>Oh! quick! get the sword out I want to cut his head off.
THIRD HEAD=>Oh, cut your own head off.
SECOND HEAD=>Yes - do us all a favour.
FIRST HEAD=>What?
THIRD HEAD=>Yapping on all the time.
SECOND HEAD=>You're lucky, you're not next to him.
THIRD HEAD=>What do you mean?
SECOND HEAD=>You snore.
THIRD HEAD=>Ooh, lies! anyway you've got bad breath.
SECOND HEAD=>Well only because you don't brush my teeth ...
THIRD HEAD=>Oh! stop bickering and let's go and have tea and biscuits.
FIRST HEAD=>All right! All right! We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits.
SECOND HEAD=>Yes.
THIRD HEAD=>Oh! not biscuits ...
FIRST HEAD=>All right! All right! not biscuits - but lets kill him anyway ...
SECOND HEAD=>He's buggered off!
THIRD HEAD=>So he has! He's scarpered.
SINGERS=>Brave Sir Robin ran away.
ROBIN=>I didn't.
SINGERS=>Bravely ran away, away.
ROBIN=>No, no, no.
SINGERS=>When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
GALAHAD=>Open. Open the doors. In the name of King Arthur. Open the doors. I am Sir Galahad, a knight of the Round Table.
ZOOT=>Hello!
GIRLIES=>Hello!
ZOOT=>Welcome, gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
GALAHAD=>The Castle Anthrax?
ZOOT=>Yes. It's not a very good name, is it? But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
GALAHAD=>Er ... You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
ZOOT=>The what? But you are tired and you must rest awhile. Midget! Crapper!
MIDGET AND CRAPPER=>Yes, O Zoot?
ZOOT=>Prepare a bed for our guest.
MIDGET AND CRAPPER=>Oh thank you, Zoot, thank you, thank you.
ZOOT=>Away varletesses! The beds here are warm and soft and very, very big.
GALAHAD=>Well, look er, I ...
ZOOT=>What is your name, handsome knight?
GALAHAD=>Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
ZOOT=>Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot But come.
GALAHAD=>Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
ZOOT=>Sir Galahad!!
ZOOT=>You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.
GALAHAD=>Well ...
ZOOT=>I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours. We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us. Oooh. It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
ZOOT=>We are just not used to handsome knights ... But you are wounded!
GALAHAD=>No, It's nothing!
ZOOT=>You must see the doctors immediately. You must lie down.
PIGLET=>Well, what seems to be the trouble?
GALAHAD=>They're doctors?
ZOOT=>They have a basic medical training, yes. Now you must try to rest. Dr. Winston! Dr. Piglet! Practice your art!!
WINSTON=>Try to relax.
GALAHAD=>No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
PIGLET=>We must examine you.
GALAHAD=>There's nothing wrong with ... that.
PIGLET=>Please ... we are doctors.
GALAHAD=>No, no, this cannot be. I am sworn to chastity!
PIGLET=>Back to your bed! At once!
GALAHAD=>I'm sorry, I must go.
GALAHAD=>Good evening ... Ah, Zoot! Er ...
DINGO=>No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
GALAHAD=>Oh. Well, I'm sorry, but I must leave immediately.
DINGO=>No! Oh, no! Bad ... bad Zoot.
GALAHAD=>Er, why?
DINGO=>She has been lying again ... she told us you had promised to stay for ever!
GALAHAD=>Oh!
GALAHAD=>Oh ... will you excuse me?
DINGO=>Where are you going?
GALAHAD=>I have seen the Grail! I have seen it - here in this castle!
DINGO=>No! Oh, no! Bad ... bad Zoot!
GALAHAD=>What is it?
DINGO=>Bad, wicked, naughty Zoot! She has been setting fire to our beacon, which - I have just remembered - is grail-shaped ... It is not the first time we've had this problem.
GALAHAD=>It's not the real Grail?
DINGO=>Wicked wicked Zoot ... she is a bad person and she must pay the penalty. And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment ... you must tie her down on a bed ... and spank her. Come!
GIRLS=>A spanking! A spanking!
DINGO=>You must spank her well and after you have spanked her you may deal with her as you like and then ... spank me.
AMAZING=>And spank me!
STUNNER=>And me.
LOVELY=>And me.
DINGO=>Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!
GIRLS=>A spanking. A spanking. There is going to be a spanking tonight.
DINGO=>And after the spanking ... the oral sex.
GALAHAD=>Oh, dear! Well, I...
GIRLS=>The oral sex ... The oral sex.
GALAHAD=>Well, I suppose I could stay a BIT longer.
LAUNCELOT=>Sir Galahad!
GALAHAD=>Oh ... hello ...
LAUNCELOT=>Quick!
GALAHAD=>Why?
LAUNCELOT=>You are in great peril.
DINGO=>No he isn't
LAUNCELOT=>Silence! Foul temptress!
GALAHAD=>Well, she's got a point.
LAUNCELOT=>We'll cover your escape!
GALAHAD=>Look - I'm fine!
GIRLS=>Sir Galahad!
GALAHAD=>No. Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!
GIRLS=>Yes, yes, let him Tackle us single-handed!
LAUNCELOT=>Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
GALAHAD=>No, really, I can cope. I can handle this lot easily!
DINGO=>Yes, let him handle us easily.
LAUNCELOT=>No sir. Quick!
GALAHAD=>No, please. Please! I can defeat them! There's only a hundred.
GIRLS=>He will beat us easily. We haven't a chance.
DINGO=>Oh shit!
LAUNCELOT=>We were in the nick of time. You were in great peril.
GALAHAD=>I don't think I was.
LAUNCELOT=>You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
GALAHAD=>Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
LAUNCELOT=>It's too perilous.
GALAHAD=>Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
LAUNCELOT=>No, no, we must find the Grail.
GALAHAD=>Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
LAUNCELOT=>No. It's unhealthy.
GALAHAD=>... I Bet you're gay.
LAUNCELOT=>No, I'm not.
VOICE OVER=>Sir Launcelot had saved Galahad from almost certain temptation but they were still lost, far from the goal of their search for the Holy Grail. Only Bedevere and King Arthur himself, riding day and night, had made any progress.
ARTHUR=>And this "Enchanter" of whom you speak, he has seen the grail?
ARTHUR=>Where does he live? Old man ... where does he live ...
SOOTHSAYER=>He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
ARTHUR=>And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
SOOTHSAYER=>There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
ARTHUR=>But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
SOOTHSAYER=>Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
ARTHUR=>The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
TALL KNIGHT OF NI=>Ni!
ARTHUR=>Easy ... boy, easy ...
SIX VOICES FROM DARKNESS=>NI! ... Peng! ... Neeee ... Wom!
ARTHUR=>Who are you?
TALL KNIGHT=>We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
BEDEVERE=>No! Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
TALL KNIGHT=>The same!
ARTHUR=>Who are they?
TALL KNIGHT=>We are the keepers of the sacred words. NI ... Peng ... and Neee ... Wom!
BEDEVERE=>Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.
TALL KNIGHT=>The Knights Who Say "Ni"! demand a sacrifice.
ARTHUR=>Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers. We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
TALL KNIGHT=>NI!
ARTHUR=>Oh!
TALL KNIGHT=>NI! NI!
ARTHUR=>Oh!
TALL KNIGHT=>We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
ARTHUR=>All right! What do you want?
TALL KNIGHT=>We want ... a shrubbery!
ARTHUR=>A what?
TALL KNIGHT=>Ni! Ni! Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
ARTHUR=>All right! All right! ... No more, please. We will find you a shrubbery ...
TALL KNIGHT=>You must return here with a shrubbery or else ... you shall not pass through this wood alive!
ARTHUR=>Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni! You are fair and just. We will return with a shrubbery.
TALL KNIGHT=>One that looks nice.
ARTHUR=>Of course.
TALL KNIGHT=>And not too expensive.
ARTHUR=>Yes ...
TALL KNIGHT=>Now - go!
OTHER KNIGHTS=>Ni! Ni!
FATHER=>One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
PRINCE=>What - the curtains?
FATHER=>No! Not the curtains, lad ... All that ... all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
PRINCE=>But, Mother ...
FATHER=>Father, lad.
PRINCE=>But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
FATHER=>Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing. All I had when I started was swamp ... other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp. I built another one ... That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp .... So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
PRINCE=>But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
FATHER=>Rather what?
PRINCE=>I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
FATHER=>You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
PRINCE=>I don't want land.
FATHER=>Listen, Alice ...
PRINCE=>Herbert.
FATHER=>Herbert ... We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
PRINCE=>But I don't like her.
FATHER=>Don't like her? What's wrong with her? She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
PRINCE=>I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
FATHER=>Cut that out!
FATHER=>Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
FIRST GUARD=>Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
FATHER=>No. Until I come and get him.
SECOND GUARD=>Hic.
FIRST GUARD=>Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.
FATHER=>No ... You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
FIRST GUARD=>... and you'll come and get him.
SECOND GUARD=>Hic.
FATHER=>That's Right.
FIRST GUARD=>We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
FATHER=>Leaving the room.
FIRST GUARD=>Leaving the room ... yes.
FATHER=>Got it?
SECOND GUARD=>Hic.
FIRST GUARD=>Er ... if ... we ... er ...
FATHER=>Yes?
FIRST GUARD=>If we ... er ...
FATHER=>Look, it's simple. Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
SECOND GUARD=>Hic.
FATHER=>Right?
FIRST GUARD=>Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
FATHER=>No .... keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
FIRST GUARD=>Oh, yes! we'll keep him in here, obviously. But if he had to leave and we were with him.
FATHER=>No ... just keep him in here.
FIRST GUARD=>Until you, or anyone else ...
FATHER=>No, not anyone else - just me.
FIRST GUARD=>Just you ...
SECOND GUARD=>Hic.
FIRST GUARD=>Get back.
FATHER=>Right.
FIRST GUARD=>Okay. Fine. We'll remain here until you get back.
FATHER=>And make sure he doesn't leave.
FIRST GUARD=>What?
FATHER=>Make sure he doesn't leave.
FIRST GUARD=>The Prince ... ?
FATHER=>Yes ... make sure ...
FIRST GUARD=>Oh yes, of course! I thought you meant him! You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
FATHER=>Is that clear?
SECOND GUARD=>Hic.
FIRST GUARD=>Oh, yes. That's quite clear. No problems.
FATHER=>Where are you going?
FIRST GUARD=>We're coming with you.
FATHER=>No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
FIRST GUARD=>Oh, I see, Right.
PRINCE=>But, Father.
FATHER=>Shut your noise, you, and get that suit on!
FATHER=>And no singing!
SECOND GUARD=>Hic.
FATHER=>Go and have a drink of water.
LAUNCELOT=>And ... o v e r ... we go!
LAUNCELOT=>Well taken, Concorde!
CONCORDE=>Thank you, sir, most kind ...
LAUNCELOT=>And another!
CONCORDE=>Message for you, sir.
LAUNCELOT=>Concorde - speak to me.
LAUNCELOT=>"To whoever finds this note - I have been imprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry against my will. Please please please please come and rescue me. I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."
LAUNCELOT=>At last! A call! A cry of distress ... Concorde! Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
CONCORDE=>I'm not quite dead, sir ...
LAUNCELOT=>Oh, well ... er brave Concorde! You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
CONCORDE=>I think I could pull through, sir.
LAUNCELOT=>Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
CONCORDE=>I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
LAUNCELOT=>I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
CONCORDE=>Really, I feel fine, sir.
LAUNCELOT=>Farewell, Concorde!
CONCORDE=>It just seems silly ... me lying here.
FIRST SENTRY=>Halt, friend ...
SECOND SENTRY=>Hey!
FIRST GUARD=>Ah! Now ... we're not allowed to ...
LAUNCELOT=>Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot. I have come to take you ... away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
PRINCE=>You got my note!
LAUNCELOT=>Well ... yes ...
PRINCE=>You've come to rescue me?
LAUNCELOT=>Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
PRINCE=>I knew that someone would come. I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
FATHER=>Stop that!
FATHER=>Who are you?
PRINCE=>I'm ... your son ...
FATHER=>Not you.
LAUNCELOT=>I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
PRINCE=>He's come to rescue me, father.
LAUNCELOT=>Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
FATHER=>Did you kill all those guards?
LAUNCELOT=>Yes ... I'm very sorry ...
FATHER=>They cost fifty pounds each!
LAUNCELOT=>Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
PRINCE=>Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot. I've got a rope here all ready ...
FATHER=>You killed eight wedding guests in all!
LAUNCELOT=>Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
FATHER=>I can understand that.
PRINCE=>Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
FATHER=>Shut up! You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
LAUNCELOT=>Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
FATHER=>Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head!
LAUNCELOT=>Gosh - Is he all right?
FATHER=>You even kicked the bride in the chest! It's going to cost me a fortune!
LAUNCELOT=>I can explain ... I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
FATHER=>Camelot? Are you from Camelot?
PRINCE=>Hurry!
LAUNCELOT=>I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
FATHER=>'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
LAUNCELOT=>Is it?
FATHER=>Do you want to come and have a drink?
LAUNCELOT=>Oh ... that's awfully nice.
PRINCE=>I am ready!
LAUNCELOT=>It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
FATHER=>Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
GUEST=>There he is!
FATHER=>Hold it!
FATHER=>Hold it! Please!
LAUNCELOT=>Sorry! Sorry ... There you See ... I just got excited again and I got carried away ... I'm ever so sorry. Sorry.
GUEST=>He's killed the best man!
SECOND GUEST=>He's killed my auntie.
FATHER=>No, please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion! Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who ... We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock. Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.
SHOUT FROM BACK=>He's not quite dead!
FATHER=>Since the fatal wounding of her father ...
SHOUT FROM BACK=>I think He's getting better!
FATHER=>For ... since her own father ... who ... when he seemed about to recover ... suddenly felt the icy ... hand of death upon him.
SHOUT FROM BACK=>Oh, he's died!
FATHER=>I want his only daughter, from now onwards, to think of me as her old dad ... in a very real and legally binding sense.
LAUNCELOT=>What?
CROWD=>The dead Prince!
CONCORDE=>He's not quite dead!
PRINCE=>I feel much better.
FATHER=>You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
PRINCE=>I was saved at the last minute.
FATHER=>How?
PRINCE=>Well ... I'll tell you ...
FATHER=>Not like that!
CROWD=>He's going to tell.
FATHER=>Shut up!
CROWD=>He's going to tell ...
FATHER=>Shut UP!
LAUNCELOT=>We must escape. Quickly before the song.
CONCORDE=>Come with me, sir.
LAUNCELOT=>You're not right for this genre ... I must escape more dramatically.
CONCORDE=>Quickly, sir, come this way!
LAUNCELOT=>No! It's not right for my idiom. I must escape more ... more ...
CONCORDE=>Dramatically, sir?
LAUNCELOT=>Dramatically.
CROWD=>He's going to tell He's going to tell He's going to tell about his great escape. Oh he fell a long long way But he's here with us today What a wonderful ... escape.
LAUNCELOT=>Excuse me ... could somebody give me a push ...
ARTHUR=>Is there anywhere where we could buy a shrubbery?
CRONE=>Who sent you?
ARTHUR=>The Knights Who Say Ni!
CRONE=>Aaaagh! No! We have no shrubberies here.
BEDEVERE=>Surely, there must be.
ARTHUR=>It will be not good to argue. These simple people are terrified of the Knights Who Say Ni!
CRONE=>Ohhh!
ARTHUR=>There is only one way to get the information we want ...
BEDEVERE=>Send her a letter from a long way away?
ARTHUR=>Er, no ... no, we must ...
BEDEVERE=>Talk to her in funny voices?
ARTHUR=>No ...
BEDEVERE=>How about trying ourselves to a tree?
ARTHUR=>No. Our only hope is to make her as afraid of us as she is of the awful Knights Who Say Ni!
BEDEVERE=>Ah! Hit ourselves with a big rock ...
ARTHUR=>No. Nothing we do to ourselves will frighten her as much as what we can do to her ...
BEDEVERE=>Ah!
ARTHUR=>We must threaten to say "Ni"!
BEDEVERE=>Oh, no.
ARTHUR=>Listen, old crone! Unless you tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will ... we will say "Ni!"
CRONE=>Do your worst! I have herd the Knights say "Ni"! in the night. I have herd the hideous Peng! and they have said "Nee-wum"! to my sister but still I have not revealed ...
ARTHUR=>Very well, old crone. Since you will not assist us voluntarily ... "Ni"!
CRONE=>No. Never. No shrubberies.
ARTHUR=>Ni!
BEDEVERE=>Nu!
ARTHUR=>No. Ni! More like this. "Ni"!
BEDEVERE=>Ni, ni, ni!
ARTHUR=>It's not working. You're not doing it properly. Ni!
BEDEVERE=>Ni!
ARTHUR=>That's it. Ni! Ni!
ROGER=>Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?
ARTHUR=>Erm, yes.
ROGER=>Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say "Ni" at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land! nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this point in time.
ARTHUR=>Did you say shrubberies?
ROGER=>Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name is Roger the Shrubber. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
BEDEVERE=>Ni!
ARTHUR=>No. No. No!
ARTHUR=>Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery. May we go now?
TALL KNIGHT=>That is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
ARTHUR=>What is that?
TALL KNIGHT=>We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
ONE KNIGHT=>Ni!
OTHERS=>Sh!
ONE KNIGHT=>Sorry.
TALL KNIGHT=>We are now the Knights Who Go Neeeow ... wum ... ping!
OTHERS=>Ni!
OTHERS=>Ni!
ONE KNIGHT=>Peng!
OTHERS=>Ni!
OTHERS=>Sh! Sh!
TALL KNIGHT=>Therefore ... we are no longer contractually bound by any agreements previously entered into by the Knights Who Say Ni!
ONE KNIGHT=>Ni!
ANOTHER=>Peng!
ANOTHER=>Sh!
TALL KNIGHT=>Shut up! Therefore, we must give you a test, a Test to satisfy the Knights who say Neeeow ... wum ... ping!
OTHERS=>Neeeow ... wum ... ping!
ARTHUR=>What is this test, Knights of N... ... Recently Knights of Ni!
KNIGHT=>Ni!
TALL KNIGHT=>Firstly. You must get us another shrubbery!
OTHER KNIGHTS=>More shrubberies! More shrubberies for the ex-Knights of Ni!
ARTHUR=>Not another shrubbery -
TALL KNIGHT=>When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
OTHER KNIGHTS=>A path! A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
TALL KNIGHT=>When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
OTHER KNIGHTS=>Yes! With a herring! With a herring! Cut down with a herring!
ARTHUR=>We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
TALL KNIGHT=>Oh, please!
ARTHUR=>Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done!
OTHER KNIGHTS=>Oh!
TALL KNIGHT=>Don't say that word.
ARTHUR=>What word?
TALL KNIGHT=>I cannot tell you. Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
ARTHUR=>How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
TALL KNIGHT=>You said it again!
ARTHUR=>What, "is"?
TALL KNIGHT=>No, no ... not "is"!
OTHER KNIGHTS=>Not "is"! Not "is"!
SIR ROBIN'S SINGERS=>Bravely good Sir Robin was not at all afraid To have his eyeballs skewered ...
TALL KNIGHT=>"Is" is all right ... You wouldn't get far not saying "Is"!
BEDEVERE=>My liege, it's Sir Robin!
TALL KNIGHT=>You've said the word again!
SINGERS=>... and his kidneys burnt and his nipples skewered off ...
ARTHUR=>Sir Robin!
ROBIN=>My liege! It's good to have found you again ...
TALL KNIGHT=>Now he's said the word!
ARTHUR=>Where are you going good Sir Robin?
ROBIN'S SINGERS=>He was going home ... he was giving up, He was throwing in the sponge.
ROBIN=>Shut up! No ... er ... no ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I certainly wasn't giving up ... I was actually looking for the grail ... er thing ... in this forest.
ARTHUR=>No ... it lies beyond this forest.
TALL KNIGHT=>Stop saying the word!
OTHER KNIGHTS=>Stop saying the word! The word we cannot hear! The word ...
ARTHUR=>Oh, stop it!
OTHER KNIGHTS=>They're all saying the word ...
TALL KNIGHT=>Stop saying it. AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
OTHER KNIGHTS=>You've said it! Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
TALL KNIGHT=>Well, At least We've got ONE shrubbery.
OTHER KNIGHTS=>Yes, Yes ... We've Done very Well ... NI!
TALL KNIGHT=>Ssh! I think somebody's coming. We'll get them to give us another shrubbery.
OTHER KNIGHTS=>Good Idea. More shrubberies. As many as possible.
TALL KNIGHT=>What shall we call ourselves this time?
KNIGHT=>How about "The knights of Nicky-Nicky"?

SECOND ADVISER=>Well obviously he'd prefer a bit of close harmony arghhh!
KNIGHTS=>Ah! There you are!

VOICE OVER=>And so Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the Enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four. Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing.
VOICE OVER=>In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels ... And there was much rejoicing ... A year passed ...
ARTHUR=>What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
TIM=>I am an enchanter.
ARTHUR=>By what name are you known?
TIM=>There are some who call me Tim?
ARTHUR=>Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
TIM=>Greetings King Arthur.
ARTHUR=>You know my name?
TIM=>I do. You seek the Holy Grail.
ARTHUR=>That is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim.
TIM=>Quite.
ARTHUR=>Yes we seek the Holy Grail. Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
ONE OR TWO KNIGHTS=>Yes it is.

KNIGHTS=>Yes, we are.
BEDEVERE=>We have been for some time.
KNIGHTS=>Yes.
ROBIN=>Months.
ARTHUR=>Yes ... and obviously any help we get is ... is very ... helpful.
GALAHAD=>Do you know where it ...

ALL OTHER KNIGHTS=>Yes.
TIM=>Yes.
KNIGHTS=>Fine.
ROBIN=>Splendid!
OTHERS=>Yes, marvellous.
ARTHUR=>Look, you're a busy man ...
TIM=>Yes, I can help you with your guest.
ALL OTHER KNIGHTS=>Thank you. Yes, thank you very much.
TIM=>To the north there lies a cave, the cave of Caerbannog, wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged ...
TIM=>... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
ARTHUR=>How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
TIM=>Follow!
ARTHUR=>What an eccentric performance!
ARTHUR=>Shhh!
BEDEVERE=>They're nervous, sire.
ARTHUR=>Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
TIM=>Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!
ARTHUR=>Keep me covered.
BEDEVERE=>What with?
ARTHUR=>Just keep me covered.
TIM=>Too late.
ARTHUR=>What?
TIM=>There he is!
ARTHUR=>Where?
TIM=>There.
ARTHUR=>Behind the rabbit?
TIM=>It is the rabbit.
ARTHUR=>... You silly sod.
TIM=>What?
ARTHUR=>You got us all worked up.
BEDEVERE=>You cretin!
TIM=>That is not an ordinary rabbit ... 'tis the most foul cruel and bad-tempered thing you ever set eyes on.
ROBIN=>You tit. I soiled my armour I was so scared!
TIM=>That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
GALAHAD=>Oh, fuck off. Get stuffed.
TIM=>He'll do you up a treat mate!
GALAHAD=>Oh yeah?
ROBIN=>You turd! Mangy scots git!
TIM=>Look. I'm warning you.
ROBIN=>What's he do? Nibble your bum?
TIM=>Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
ARTHUR=>Go on, Bors, chop its head off.
BORS=>Right. Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew coming up.
TIM=>Look!
ARTHUR=>Je...sus Christ!
TIM=>I warned you!
ROBIN=>I done it again.
TIM=>Did I tell you? Did you listen to me? Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you? No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it. The names you called me. Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
ARTHUR=>Oh, shut up.
TIM=>It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
ARTHUR=>Charge!
ALL KNIGHTS=>Run away! Run away!
TIM=>Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.
ARTHUR=>Who did we lose?
LAUNCELOT=>Sir Gawain.
GALAHAD=>Ector.
ARTHUR=>And Bors. Five.
GALAHAD=>Three, sir!
ARTHUR=>Three. Well, we'll not risk another frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite.
ROBIN=>Would it help to confuse him if we ran away more.
ARTHUR=>Shut up. Go and change your armour.
GALAHAD=>Let us taunt it. It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.
ARTHUR=>Like what?
GALAHAD=>Do we have any bows?
ARTHUR=>No.
LAUNCELOT=>We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
ROBIN=>The what?
ARTHUR=>The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. 'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard always carries with him.
ALL=>Yes. Of course.
ARTHUR=>Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!
ARTHUR=>How does it ... er ...
LAUNCELOT=>I know not.
ARTHUR=>Consult the Book of Armaments.
BROTHER MAYNARD=>Armaments Chapter Two Verses Nine to Twenty One.
ANOTHER MONK=>And St. Attila raised his hand grenade up on high saying "O Lord bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy. "and the Lord did grin and people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orang-utans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and...
BROTHER MAYNARD=>Skip a bit brother ...
ANOTHER MONK=>... Er ... oh, yes ... and the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shalt be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thou foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.
ARTHUR=>Right.
ARTHUR=>One, two , three ... , five ...
GALAHAD=>Three, sir!
ARTHUR=>Three.
ALL KNIGHTS=>Praise be to the lord. Huzzah!
ARTHUR=>There! Look!
BEDEVERE=>What does it say?
GALAHAD=>What language is this?
BEDEVERE=>Brother Maynard, you are a scholar.
BROTHER MAYNARD=>It is Aramaic!
GALAHAD=>Of course. Joseph of Aramathea!
ALL=>Of course.
ARTHUR=>What does it say?
BROTHER MAYNARD=>It reads ... "Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Aramathea."
ARTHUR=>What?
BROTHER MAYNARD=>"The Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."
BEDEVERE=>What's that?
BROTHER MAYNARD=>He must have died while carving it.
BEDEVERE=>Oh, come on.
BROTHER MAYNARD=>That's what it says.
ARTHUR=>But if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh". He'd just say it.
BROTHER MAYNARD=>It's down there carved in stone.
GALAHAD=>Perhaps he was dictating.
ARTHUR=>Shut up. Is that all it says?
BROTHER MAYNARD=>That's all. "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".
ARTHUR=>"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".
BEDEVERE=>Do you think he meant the Camargue?
GALAHAD=>Where's that?
BEDEVERE=>France, I think.
LAUNCELOT=>Isn't there a St. Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh's in Cornwall?
ARTHUR=>No, that's Saint Ives.
ROBIN=>Hey!
BEDEVERE=>No, that's in Herefordshire.
ROBIN=>No ... HEY!!!
LAUNCELOT=>"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... "
ROBIN=>No! "Hey"! is surprise and alarm!
BEDEVERE=>Oooooh!
LAUNCELOT=>No "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... " at the back of the throat.
BEDEVERE=>No! "Oooooh!" in surprise and alarm!
ARTHUR=>Oh!
GALAHAD=>My God!
LAUNCELOT=>What is it?
BEDEVERE=>I know! I know! I Know!
ARTHUR=>What?
BEDEVERE=>It's the ... oh ... it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
ARTHUR=>What?
BEDEVERE=>It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
ARTHUR=>Who was that?
HECTOR=>It was Sir Alf.
ARTHUR=>I didn't know we had a Sir Alf.
HECTOR=>He was feeding it bread.
ARTHUR=>Well, that was a very silly thing to do. Now the rest of you stand well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
HECTOR=>Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
ROBIN=>Look out.
GAWAIN=>It's only a cartoon.
ARTHUR=>Sh!
VOICE OVER=>As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless, when, suddenly ... the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.
ANIMATOR=>Aaaaagh!
VOICE OVER=>The cartoon peril was no more ... The Quest for Holy Grail could continue.
GALAHAD=>Look!
GALAHAD=>There it is!
ARTHUR=>The Bridge of Death!
ROBIN=>Oh! Great ...
ARTHUR=>God be praised. This must be the gorge of which the old man spoke in scene twenty-four.
BEDEVERE=>We must find the bridge ... the Bridge of Death ...
ROBIN=>Oh, great!
BEDEVERE=>The Bridge is guarded by a bridgekeeper, who asks each traveller three questions. And he who answers the three questions can cross in safety.
ROBIN=>And if you get a question wrong?
BEDEVERE=>You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
ARTHUR=>He's the Keeper of the Bridge. It's the old man.
BEDEVERE=>Who's going to answer the questions?
ARTHUR=>You go, Robin, and God be with you.
ROBIN=>Er ... I tell you what - Why doesn't Launcelot go?
ARTHUR=>Very well ... Sir Launcelot. Brave Sir Launcelot. This is the Bridge of Death ...
LAUNCELOT=>Oh, yes sir ... I will take it single-handed. I will ...
ARTHUR=>No, hang on. All we want is for you to approach the old man and he will ask you three questions. Answer those question as best you can, and we will watch ... and pray.
LAUNCELOT=>Yes, my liege ...
ARTHUR=>Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot! Be careful ...
ARTHUR=>Listen to the questions.
BEDEVERE=>Look! It's the old man from scene 24 - what's he Doing here?
ARTHUR=>He is the keeper of the Bridge. He asks each traveler five questions ...
GALAHAD=>Three questions.
ARTHUR=>Three questions ... he who answers the five questions
GALAHAD=>Three questions.
ARTHUR=>Three questions, may cross in safety.
ROBIN=>And if you get a question wrong?
ARTHUR=>You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
ROBIN=>Oh ... wacho!
GALAHAD=>Who's going to answer the questions?
ARTHUR=>Sir Robin, Brave Sir Robin you go.
ROBIN=>Hey! I've got a great idea! Why doesn't Launcelot go?
LAUNCELOT=>Yes. Let me. I will take it single-handed ... I will make feint to the north-east ...
ARTHUR=>No, hang on! Just answer the five questions ...

ARTHUR=>How dare you profane this place with your presence! I command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, open the door to the Sacred Castle, to which God himself has guided us! Come.
FROG=>How you English say: I one more time, mac, I unclog my nose towards you, sons of a window-dresser, so, you think you could out-clever us French fellows with your silly knees-bent creeping about advancing behaviour. I wave my private parts at your aunties, you brightly-coloured, mealy-templed, cranberry-smelling, electric donkey-bottom biters.
ARTHUR=>In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle.
FROG=>No chance, English bed-wetting types. We burst our pimples at you, and call your door-opening request a silly thing. You tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!
ARTHUR=>If you do not open these doors, we will take this castle by force ...
ARTHUR=>In the name of God ... and the glory of our ...
FROG=>Yes, depart a lot at this time, and cut the approaching any more or we fire arrows into the tops of your heads and make castanets of your testicles already.
