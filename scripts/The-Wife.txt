ARVID ENGDAHL=>Mr. Castleman, you are still on as well?
ARVID ENGDAHL=>It is my great honor and pleasure to tell you Mr. Castleman, that you have been chosen to receive this year's Nobel Prize in literature.
ARVID ENGDAHL=>Mr. Castleman, we are so delighted to be giving you this prize. Your career has a truly remarkable span to it.
ARVID ENGDAHL=>You should know that your husband will be fending off the press today, so what I advise is that you monitor his calls, as it does get quite exhausting.
