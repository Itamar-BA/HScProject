HENRY IV=>Are they in train?
NORTHUMBERLAND=>Harry. Please. Stop this.
HENRY IV=>Has this been heard, Percy?
HENRY IV=>But if only he were my son.
HAL=>What is this?
FALSTAFF=>The door was ajar.
HAL=>What is this?
CLOAKED MAN=>Your father, His Majesty King Henry, is ill. He requests your presence.
HAL=>He shouldn’t.
HENRY IV=>The time has come for me to consider the issue of my succession. You will not be king.
HAL=>What business?
ARCHBISHOP=>The King needs rest.
ARCHBISHOP=>I give him comfort -
HAL=>You deserve no comfort.
HENRY IV=>I know not what I have done.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN=>What is your purpose here?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN=>Pardon me. Not from the King. It’s from the Prince, his son. The Dauphin.
CAMBRIDGE’S STEWARD=>A Frenchman, sire. He says he wishes to speak with you privately.
WILLIAM=>I wish it were not so. But problems, my liege - this is my experience - problems left unattended have a habit of becoming crises. You have a chance here to unite this land truly. You have refreshed its mood with promise. But promise must be fulfilled. Promise can never be an end in itself.
CAMBRIDGE=>Pray how, my liege?
GUARD=>All leave. Now.
HOOPER=>This is my place.
HOODED MAN=>The hostess can stay.
FALSTAFF=>Square my account with this terrible hag, would you?
HAL=>How dare you?
FALSTAFF=>They will respond.
FALSTAFF=>Good night, Hal. Sleep well.
HAL=>Is this folly?
HAL=>What say you?
HAL=>Now. Call it.
HAL=>Kill them all.
KING CHARLES VI=>I like to have the sun on my skin. But not too much. Too much is very dangerous. So I take only a small amount.
KING CHARLES VI=>And here I meet the man about whom I have heard such a great deal. Much of it apocryphal, no doubt. Rumour and gossip.
KING CHARLES VI=>And yet when finally you are here before me, this apocrypha becomes air. Or memory. Nothing.
KING CHARLES VI=>This conversation we have - or are about to have - has been had many times before and will be had many times again for centuries to come, between men from all corners, between men of vanity and men of good reason, in whatever combination. I would like to believe that you and I are men of good reason. Men of vanity would have this trouble continue until the brink of our mutual devastation. Maybe beyond.
KING CHARLES VI=>I have, of course, travelled here to offer you my surrender.
KING CHARLES VI=>My son caused me much pain. And by extension he caused more pain to both of us than I care to examine. But my daughter... She would follow me to the far corners without dispute. I would hope that a bond between you, between us, might prevent these troubles from recurring.
KING CHARLES VI=>It is most uncanny, and yet not so at all, that the great movements of history so frequently find their origins in the minutia of family.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN=>As you wish, Your Majesty.
HAL=>How many head?
HAL=>Stay up there.
WILLIAM=>That is the sound of peace.
WILLIAM=>That is the sound of peace.
WILLIAM=>That is the sound of your greatness.
