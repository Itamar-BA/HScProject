DARIUS=>This is, this is - okay, what? What is wrong with me?
ERIC=>It’s so early.
DARIUS=>Oh my God, are you serious? He just flexed his chest.
ON COMPUTER SCREEN:=>Arnau’s pixel pirate, still in seizure, is approached by a fat pirate and a chat box appears: WTF U DOING? The fat pirate waits for a moment, then casually stabs the jittering pirate with a sword, dropping him dead. INT. PARKING GARAGE - MORNING Darius and Arnau get into Jeff’s Acura.
DARIUS=>You’re obviously not serious about your schoolwork.
JEFF=>What the fuck are you interning at a magazine for?
OUTSIDE:=>Passing images. -- Sign reads “Beaches 5 Miles.” -- Bridges connect a marshy mainland to the island beach towns. -- A seafood restaurant with a giant crab on the roof. -- A place called Shell World. -- Freezing TEENS run in soaked shirts across the street. -- A sign reads “Ocean View.” We get a good look at Ocean View. Nobody on the roads, nobody on the beach. The summer’s as faded as the last gasps of the day’s sunlight here. The town feels lonely. Too cold and too late in September. EXT. SEASIDE INN MOTEL - MORNING A crusty motel that hasn’t been remodeled since the early 70’s. The Acura pulls into the parking lot. The three exit. Jeff walks to a porch that looks out on the ocean. The sky is smeared and overcast. A chilling wind blows off the gray water. Darius appears behind him, wrapped up in a hoodie.
JEFF=>Aw, forget it.
INSIDE THE POST OFFICE=>A FIGURE, only visible from behind, opens box 322. Nothing inside, he quickly closes it and steps away. Darius cranes her neck but can’t get a good look at the Figure exiting the front door.
SHIFT MANAGER=>Aw jeez, what’d he do? I apologize ma’am, he’s a little...
JEFF=>Wait a minute.
JEFF=>And it wasn’t twenty years. It was like thirteen.
DARIUS=>Can I go in, too?
ON THE FRONT PORCH=>Kenneth stops at the bottom of the porch.
JEFF=>I’ve got guts.
KENNETH=>What kind of gun?
JEFF=>You should fucking put the moves on these chicks.
JEFF=>Don’t worry, he’s still gonna fuck your daughter.
DARIUS=>I’m getting better than you. All I need is one shot.
KENNETH=>It’s easy to shoot standing still with no pressure.
MAN IN FLANNEL=>Hey! Stop your shooting!
DARIUS=>I was born ready. KENNETH
KENNETH=>I do have to know what you’re going back for, though.
DARIUS=>Good. You should.
JEFF=>What happened? LIZ
JEFF=>Arnau, the man. ARNAU
DARIUS=>No wonder you didn’t nail her, with lines like that. ARNAU
KENNETH=>I’m going back for a girl. Belinda St. Sing.
JEFF=>Fucking lasers? ARNAU
LIZ=>That’s what you said about the fried chicken. JEFF
ARNAU=>No, I’m not gay.
JEFF=>You don’t even know what you’re talking about. ARNAU
BELINDA=>Hi. Darius, right?
DARIUS=>Kenneth, oh God.
DARIUS=>No. No, I’m not.
KENNETH=>A magazine story?
ARNAU=>Whoa, awesome. JEFF
ON DARIUS=>Realizing she knows exactly how they’d know. EXT. LAKE - DUSK Darius hurries down the hill to the base of the tree at the edge of the lake. She reaches her arm into the hollow of the tree and removes the ammunition tin. She sits down on the hill with the tin on her knees as Jeff and Arnau approach. She opens it. There’s a note inside. Her fingers almost tremble as she reads.
UP THE HILL=>Jones and Smith crest the hill behind them, out of breath. They spot the machine and share a bewildered look.
ON THE DOCK=>Kenneth sees Darius as she runs onto the dock.
ON THE DOCK=>Arnau picks up the fallen note as Jones and Smith walk past. Jeff watches in disbelief.
ON THE MACHINE=>floating away from the dock, rocking wildly in the water. Kenneth holds on to the support rail with Darius. His wide eyes look upwards, hopeful, expectant. As the roaring engines reach a crescendo, we hear a loud POP. Kenneth’s expression is invaded by doubt.
ON THE MACHINE=>Kenneth pushes buttons and checks gauges, his face wracked with desperation. The spinning parts are now grinding. Smoke spills upwards. Darius watches Kenneth with a desperate look, hoping for something that is not possible and she knows it. Kenneth shouts at the controls, pleading and anguished. His shouts fade with the roar of the engines as the machine slowly winds down and finally becomes deathly quiet, bobbing on the black water. Kenneth slumps back against the rail. All hope drains from Darius. She puts a hand on his. Jeff and Arnau watch silently and sadly from the dock as Jones and Smith ready their handcuffs.
SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED=>Photos of Kenneth that we saw earlier in his house are patched in amongst the paragraphs. We see her face as she stops on one photo in particular: Kenneth, age five, before he ever was the butt of any joke, smiling with wide, innocent eyes and just one ear.
