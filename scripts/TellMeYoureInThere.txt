RACHAEL=>Can’t. Got plans.
RACHAEL=>Take him with you. I seriously have plans.
RACHAEL=>Shut it, monkey boy.
RACHAEL=>But, mum…
YOUNG JIM=>Oh, shite to this.
JOSH=>We’re not getting undressed with you standing there!
TOBY=>Unless you really want to see my knob!
RACHAEL=>Gone now. Weird.
LUCY=>Give it chance.
MICK=>That’s one of the motion detectors in the corridor.
BRIAN=>You were saying? Can you give us another sign, please? Can you bang on the walls? Once for yes and twice for no?
BRIAN=>He who smelt it dealt it.
LUCY=>You okay, Fee?
MICK=>Not bloody likely. I’m not leaving it all there to be nicked by some friggin’ junkie.
LUCY=>Look at this!
FIONA=>Not a bad tune.
FIONA=>So get dressed!
LUCY=>But you saw the video. You heard the sounds on the DVR. You saw what happened to Jim and there was that awful smell?
MICK=>Oh, come on, Luce. There’s about as much chance of that as…
MICK=>Except Fiona’s.
FIONA=>Jim? I’m just nipping out for a bit. Won’t be long.
MICK=>Fuck you, then. Fuck you and fuck everybody else.
BRIAN=>
JOSH=>Cool story, mum.
FIONA=>Be good, love.
JIM=>Are you sure?
FIONA=>Jim! What’s got into you? Ever since the other night, you’ve been a right pillock. Nothing I say is right and you won’t give me the time of day about anything.
JIM=>Lucy’s dead.
TIM=>No, Rach. Come in with us.
BRIAN=>Mick... Mick...
FIONA=>Where’s Rachael?
BETHANY=>She went home. We were supposed to meet Rio, but he never turned up.
RACHAEL=>Yeah. Home sweet home. At least my mum will be happy.
LUCY=>You are us, Michael. We are you. Come to me, my love.
JIM=>What? What are you talking about?
RACHAEL=>I don’t think so.
RACHAEL=>What’s this? How…?
YOUNG ALKELDA=>My mother likes them, but only I know that they grow here. Nobody else dare come this far into the forest.
JIM=>Rachael. Go! Get her out of here!
FIONA=>Jim, don’t you hurt him. He’s innocent.
FIONA=>Yeah. Come on.
FIONA=>I’m not sure, Josh. I think Rachael’s here somewhere.
JOSH=>I’m scared.
RACHAEL=>Mum? Are you okay?
JOSH=>Will this do?
JIM=>Was I talking to you, witch? I don’t think I was. So please go over there and be quiet.
JIM=>No fucking way, witch! This sweet piece of ass is ours.
JIM=>Fine.
JOSH=>When are you coming home, Rach?
