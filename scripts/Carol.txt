THERESE=>She looks like you. Around the mouth. The eyes. CAROL
THERESE=>Merry Christmas.
CAROL=>I like your hat.
THERESE=>Where do you work?

ABBY=>Call me later.
JENNIFER=>But no Santa Claus.
JEANETTE=>
CAROL=>So? You like it.
CAROL=>
DANNIE=>Or certain people. There are certain people you like...
AFTERNOON.=>THERESE, in coat, scarf and gloves, waits for CAROL’S car to pull up outside. RICHARD waits with her.
THERESE=>There’s my ride.
CAROL.=>THERESE loves the feeling of the needles against her skin, the way it smells, the way she knows that CAROL is beside her, though she can’t see her. The car comes to a halt in front of CAROL’S house. It’s a big house, a bigger house than THERESE has ever been inside. CAROL turns off the engine.
RINDY=>This one, Mommy.
CAROL=>That’s my girl.
THERESE=>Well... actually.
CAROL=>Invite me round.
CAROL=>Harge, please...
THERESE=>I - work at Frankenberg’s. The department store.
HARGE=>You smell good. CAROL
HARGE=>I’m not drunk.
CAROL=>I can’t do that. HARGE
CAROL=>Stop it, Harge. HARGE
MRS. SEMCO=>
THERESE=>Ninety-eight point six. Perfectly normal. No fever. RICHARD
RICHARD=>Ma - cut it out.
THERESE=>Okay - I’ll eat.
THERESE=>I can’t open this now. It’s days before Christmas. RICHARD
CAROL=>On what grounds.
CAROL=>Can I see her?
THERESE=>Ohh, I don’t know. RICHARD
THERESE=>Don’t lie. You told me about those two other girls. RICHARD
ABBY=>How could he. How dare he... A morality what?
CAROL=>Bullshit. You have no idea what I’m talking about. ABBY
CAROL=>You’re serious.
CAROL=>It’s perfect.
THERESE=>Yes. Yes, I would.
THERESE=>She’s a friend. RICHARD
CAROL=>I’m not alone. ABBY
CAROL=>Absolutely none.
ABBY=>But it’s nice to meet you, Therese, all the same.
ABBY=>Two or three.
ABBY=>You old enough to smoke?
THERESE=>For you. Merry Christmas.
CAROL=>Therese, is that you?
THERESE=>I need lipstick.
HARGE=>All right, Carol. Enough is enough. Now where are you, goddamnit?... Hello?
TOMMY TUCKER=>Yep, that’s a flat alright. Just hope you didn’t dent that rim.
CAROL=>Happy New Year.
CAROL=>I never looked like that.
THERESE=>What are you doing with that? Carol - what happened?! CAROL pushes past THERESE.
CAROL=>How much is Harge paying you for this? I’ll give you double, triple. Anything you want.
CAROL=>He’s actually not a doctor but a psychotherapist.
CONTINUOUS.=>CAROL runs to greet RINDY, who walks hand-in-hand with a MIDDLE AGED COUPLE, RINDY’S AUNT AND UNCLE. When she sees her Mother, RINDY lets go of their hands and runs towards CAROL. They meet. CAROL kneels down and sweeps RINDY into her arms. She hugs her tightly, holding on for dear life.
DANNIE=>So what happened? THERESE
THERESE=>I’m not afraid.
THERESE=>Thank her for me? RICHARD
THERESE=>What did we have?
RICHARD=>Thanks, that’s... THERESE
CAROL=>Don’t be silly.
ABBY=>And... Therese?
CAROL=>What about her?
DANNIE=>I met a girl. Louise. She’s got green eyes, she’s a movie encyclopedia, and the most amazing thing? She thinks I’m boss.
GENEVIEVE=>I’m a fortune giver.
CAROL=>I won’t deny the truth of what’s contained in those tapes.
FRED HAYMES=>
CAROL=>I wanted - I did want - to talk about... duty... sacrifice. That was what I- ... But now that I’m here I don’t... I don’t know what I believe... Or what I even know... except that...
CAROL=>I’m no martyr. I have no clue... what’s best for me. But I do know... I feel, I feel it in my bones... what’s best for my daughter.
THERESE=>I always wondered... Why did you come over to me? CAROL
O/S JACK TAFT=>Therese? Is that you?
THERESE=>Jack, this is Carol Aird.
