MRS MACAULEY=>Your father’s life ended two years ago. But he is with us, still. Because you and I and Marcus and Homer and your sister Bess remember him. His goodness is with us, because it is in you...and in Marcus...and in Homer...and in Bess. Goodness never ends.
SPANGLER=>Send it paid, Willie.
MRS. MARGARET STRICKMAN=>1874 BIDDLE STREET YORK, PENNSYLVANIA
HOMER=>If he doesn’t do his work, they’ll put him on a pension. I got him sober all right...and everything was okay. But...everything...has changed...
MARCUS=>My books, my phonograph, my records, my clothes when you’re ready to fit into them, my microscope, my fishing tackle...
HOMER=>Go back to sleep.
ULYSSES=>Gonna go to school?
HOMER=>Did you wave back?
MARCUS=>It is not easy for me to hope for so much from you, when I myself did not begin to work until I was nineteen, but somehow I believe that you will be able to do what I could not do.
MARCUS=>I do not recognize any enemy which is human, for no human being can be my enemy.
(V.O.=>CONT’D) Whoever he is, whatever color he is, however mistaken he may be in what he believes...
MARCUS=>I would rather I were not in the Army. I would rather there were no War...
(V.O.=>CONT’D) I have no idea what is ahead, but whatever it is I am humbly ready for it.
ULYSSES=>You go ahead, Homer!
SPANGLER=>Aw, hell. I’ll take the call. I’ll get there first myself!
TOBEY=>Matthew Macauley.
MARY=>Soldiers, Bess...
HOMER=>Aw, it’s nothing.
MRS MACAULEY=>But I do know this: That the world waits to be made-over every morning by each and every human being who inhabits it.
NICKIE=>Watch! Lookit him!
ALF=>I don’t know...
MARCUS=>I guess I have just been taking my time, and there is just a lot to say.
MARCUS=>But I want you to know I will be obeying no command other than the command of my own heart.
SOLDIER ONE=>JUST LET ME LOOK AT IT!
HOMER=>Just...I’ll be right back!
