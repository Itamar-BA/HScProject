ANOTHER ANGLE=>They are all presided over by larger-than-life BISHOP WILKES, dressed in ministerial robes with colorful Afrocentric accents. He taps Dave on the shoulder.
CLOSER ANGLE=>At the edge of the crowd, Dave is standing with his new bride and his best man Brock, with whom he trades a hesitant look.
CLOSER ANGLE=>Mama pulls in close and begins to talk in hushed tones to Dave, her manufactured smile never leaving her face.
PHOTO ALBUM MONTAGE:=>A) DAVE IN HIS COLLEGE BASKETBALL UNIFORM. B) CLARICE IN HER COLLEGE CHEERLEADING OUTFIT.
DAVE=>I know, Boo.
FEMALE VOICE=>Hi, Brock... this is Partygirl 229 Remember me from Singles Chat-dot- com? I got your number from Surferdude 102 who it got it from a friend of his who knows how to track people down. I was thinking we could meet for drinks and --
ANOTHER ANGLE=>TRACK Julie over to the bullpen where she hands Jerry’s chart to a middle-aged, humorless-looking OFFICE SUPERVISOR.
SERIES OF SLOW-MOTION SHOTS=>A) Dave fires a chest past to Brock. B) Darnell sees what’s happening and moves into action. C) As Brock goes up for his shot, a black fist flies INTO FRAME and connects with his face -- hard. D) Brock slams to the floor and the ball goes rolling out of bounds, and we’ll be overtaken by REAL TIME once again. Brock jumps to his feet, blood gushing from his nose, and immediately charges Darnell. And soon they are a whirling dervish of flying kicks and punches, and Dave and some of the other players immediately rush in to break it up.
WIDER ANGLE=>And we now know we are watching a 50-meter freestyle race between several adolescent boys in an Olympic-size pool in an outdoor swim stadium with bleachers and stadium lights lighting up the night sky.
TRACKING ANGLE=>Bryson hits the opposite wall a half-length behind the leader, but coming out of his flip turn, he turns on the afterburners and easily zooms into the lead. He hits the wall in first place, a length ahead of the next best swimmer. And a mother’s shrill voice pierces the air.
ANOTHER ANGLE=>As Bryson climbs out of the pool, we can see he’s a good- looking kid with an innocent face. He looks up to see his mother, Julie Sawyer, rushing over with a towel. He looks over at some of the other teenage swimmers, whose mothers are pulling similar stunts. They all look completely humiliated.
JULIE=>And why is that?
CLOSER ANGLE=>We see that she is indeed awake, but in no mood to cooperate. And we’ll HEAR the CRACK of a ball coming off a bat.
WIDER ANGLE=>“Coach” Dave is holding the bat, and his assistant, Brock, is shagging the balls at home plate, and it’s clear that we are in the middle of a Little League team practice. The team is a Fat Albert gang of various shapes and sizes, some raggedy, some street-heartened. Besides Carlos, we’ll come to know a few of them as JAYLEN, DARIUS, MARCUS and DESHAWN. Dave calls out to Carlos, slightly annoyed.
ANOTHER ANGLE=>Some boys sprint in and gather around Dave and Brock, others drag in huffing and puffing. All are jabbering.
THEIR POV=>Darnell is approaching with a couple of what, in the inner- city city, could be described as a “ho’s” in painted on jeans on his arm. He is chugging from a forty-ounce malt liquor and staring at us with red, dead eyes.
BACK TO SCENE=>Dave stares back, anger brewing in his eyes.
ANGLE BACK ON CADILLAC=>By now, other onlookers have made their way to the car.
DAVE=>How bad is it?
CARMEN=>Nope. Just you.
THEIR POV=>Dave’s butt making that back-and-forth power-walker motion.
BACK TO SCENE=>The Nurse is enjoying the view. PUSHY NURSE
ANGLE ON DAVE=>He slam dunks the ball and the whole backboard shudders. As he turns back the court, a basketball is fired at him from o.s. and he catches it, surprised. We ADJUST to see Brock.
ANGLE ON LIVING ROOM=>Watching from a rocking chair is Mama. And as begin HEARING a tune like Luther Vandross’ “HERE AND NOW,” we can see that Mama didn’t like that exchange one little bit.
A MONTAGE OF SCENES=>A) INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY Another visit by Julie, and this time, she has Clarice working with hand weights, making rowing motions with her arms... keeping her from upper body atrophy. B) And yet another session with Clarice -- this time raising and lowering her non-injured leg. Hip work. And we begin HEARING Dave’s remembering voice again.
DAVE=>Women started bein’ their own heroes. Maybe because their men forgot how to be, or maybe because they didn’t want to be protected anymore.
JULIE=>It could happen.
TRACKING ANGLE TO CAR=>Dave crosses back to the street where Brock’s Beamer is waiting with the engine running. As he does, we now see that Julie’s Sentra is parked in her driveway.
ANOTHER ANGLE=>Clarice looks stunning in her best church dress and hat as she slowly enters with the aid her cane. Dave, in his best suit, is at her side. Mama, also looking lovely, follows behind, AD LIBBING greetings with acquaintances like a mother hen. Michelle, already there with her handsome husband TODD, stands up in her pew and gasps when she sees Clarice walking.
CLARICE=>Hi, sister girl.
SERIES OF MOS SHOTS=>A) A vibrant church choir in their colorful robes in all their wonderful glory, singing the song we’re hearing. B) A young girl singing a solo in the middle of the number. C) Michelle and Todd lifting their hands in praise as the song continues. D) Bishop Wilkes preaching the word with authority. He wipes his brow and his tears as he preaches. That’s what happens when the Holy Ghost comes over a prophet. E) Mama speaks back the Bishop as he makes a point she likes. F) Clarice looks up at the cross at the front of the church. Being in church does her heart good. F) Dave staring straight ahead, thinking. Distracted. And as the SONG CONCLUDES, we’ll...
DAVE’S POV=>A Caucasian WOMAN with her back turned to us. From this angle, her curvy build and hairstyle look exactly like somebody we’ve seen before. She’s just cleaned up in a Sunday dress and high-heels.
BACK TO SCENE=>A smile grows on Dave’s face. He can’t believe it. He taps the woman on the shoulder.
CLARICE=>That’s not true.
ANNOUNCER=>This is a test of the emergency alert system. This is only a test. If this had been an actual emergency, an official message would follow.
THEIR POV=>Smiling Julie and Bryson striding toward us, waving, calling.
BACK TO SCENE=>If it’s possible for a black man to blanche, Dave does.
ANOTHER ANGLE=>As Julie and Bryson arrive at home plate.
VARIOUS REACTIONS=>Around the diamond -- from stunned to skeptical to jaws hanging open.
ANGLE ON STANDS=>Julie is watching and her concern turns into a smile. BACK TO SCENE
ANGLE ON STANDS=>Now Julie is concerned, and biting her nails nervously.
BACK TO SCENE=>This time Brock does the reprimanding, glaring at Darius.
SERIES OF SHOTS=>A) The ball comes sailing in. B) Bryson narrows his eyes. C) Here comes his bat. D) Here comes the ball. E) The bat impacts with the ball with a loud CRACK. F) There goes the ball. A rocket shot. G) Marcus throws off his catchers mask, astonished look on his face. H) Darius can clearly be seen mouthing the word “shit.” I) Brock follows the trajectory with his eyes.
ANGLE INCLUDING=>Dave and he has a loaded-for-bear look in his eye.
HER POV=>While we can’t make out Dave’s conversation through the window, he seems to be chatting happily with someone.
BACK TO SCENE=>Clarice turns and sees Mama watching her from the doorway.
ANOTHER ANGLE=>His back is covered with oil, and now petite, yet strong WHITE FEMALE HANDS begin running down his naked back in a suggestive way. Her fingers linger at his towel line teasingly. We catch a glimpse of a short, sexy silk robe. Dave moans as she whispers in his ear. Dave then turns over on his back and looks up at us.
HIS POV=>The sexy woman is Julie. She smiles seductively and begins to loosen the belt of her robe.
BACK TO SCENE=>Dave closes his eyes, receiving some mysterious pleasure.
BACK TO SCENE=>Clarice stares at the screen for a long beat, then quietly returns the phone to the night stand, falls into her pillow.
ANGLE ABOVE BED=>The two of them, their backs turned to each other, both awake. Both thinking, worrying.
MICHELLE=>Last thing you wanna do is something you can’t take back.
OUR POV=>A single-engine plane trailing an advertising banner reading: “THE GREATEST TRAGEDY IS INDIFFERENCE... THE RED CROSS.”
BACK TO SCENE=>But Dave and Julie are too engrossed in the meet to notice.
SERIES OF SHOTS=>A) We’re UNDER WATER as Bryson hits the pool and we’ll track his progress from this angle for several strokes. B) And now we’re at the edge of the pool looking across all eight lanes and watching the swimmers. Bryson and another boy are just a nose ahead of the pack. C) Dave and Julie are watching breathless as parents all around CHEERING and SCREAMING. D) UNDER WATER, Bryson hits the turn wall one stroke behind the leader and a few strokes ahead of the next best swimmer. Bryson’s flip turn is perfect. E) Now we’re half way back to the finish line and Bryson begins to turn on the afterburners. He catches the leader. F) CLOSE ON FROM ABOVE Bryson and the leader. Nose and nose. G) Dave is now cheering with the rest of the parents, but Julie has her eyes closed. Can’t bear to watch. H) At the wall, it’s a photo finish for Bryson and the other swimmer. Too close for us to call.
ANGLE BY POOL=>A proud Coach Spinello is already wrapping Bryson in a towel.
ANGLE ON TABLE=>Dave and Julie are chatting freely, picking at the last slivers of a pizza together in a quiet booth.
ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR=>Brock just entering in his best Saturday casual. As he crosses into the restaurant he does a double-take when he sees Dave and Julie looking at him from a private booth.
BACK TO SCENE=>Dave hangs his head. The moment is over. Brock walks up to their table, surprised, confused.
TRACKING ANGLE=>FOLLOW Dave over to Julie and Bryson at the video games.
CLARICE=>I’ll be careful.
ANGLE ON BLEACHERS=>Julie goes wild with joy and begins hugging everybody around her. But then Julie feels a need to look down at the pool.
HER POV=>A crowd has gathered around Bryson’s lane. Something’s wrong. Bryson’s not getting out of the water.
CLOSE ANGLE ON PHONE=>The caller ID display reads: “SAWYER, JULIE.”
BACK TO SCENE=>Mama scowls. She presses POWER button and turns the phone off. She sets it back down with a self-righteous look. And as she does, our SONG and SERIES OF SCENES will end.
CLARICE=>Oh, sweet Jesus.
ANOTHER ANGLE=>As Julie gets out of the car, an OLDER COUPLE gets out of the sedan and rushes to her. They are her parents, and Julie falls into her mother’s arms, and they both sob right there in the driveway, as Julie’s father tries to comfort them.
CLOSER ANGLE=>And as we PAN the very black, singing faces of the GOSPEL ENSEMBLE, we now know who Dave has helped Julie turn to, and the song will take us into:
SERIES OF SHOTS=>A) We’re CLOSE ON a lovely casket, and ADJUST to see a beautiful wreath of flowers and then a framed photograph of a smiling Bryson Sawyer -- his eyes staring straight out at us, almost immortal. B) We PAN the front row of seated mourners... a red-eyed Ted on one end with Kate standing behind him... then Julie’s mother and father, and then finally Julie, with Dave in his best black suit, standing behind her. C) A very sober Coach Spinello and several of Bryson’s teammates, all dressed in their matching swim club warm ups, file past the casket, and the coach lays Bryson’s gold medal atop the casket. D) We PAN the very white FACES of the larger gathering of mourners who have gathered -- friends, extended family, schoolmates -- and two black faces -- Bishop Wilkes, dressed in his most colorful, hopeful ministerial robes, and Carmen McAtee, with her dreads done up with ribbons. E) Dave turns to see Brock arriving with Darius, Deshawn, Marcus and Jaylen -- all dressed respectfully in dress shirts and ties. Dave moves to them and shakes each of their hands, before embracing Brock in a long hug. F) Brock escorts his little leaguers past the casket, and each one leaves an offering for Bryson -- a bat, a baseball, a glove, and finally a team jersey with the name “SAWYER” in letters on the back. G) Tears stream down Julie’s face as her son is honored. Dave puts his strong hand on her shoulder for support. She reaches up and takes it and holds on for dear life. H) Coach Spinello comes to the front of the gathering and reads from some typed pages -- the eulogy. I) And as the SONG ENDS, so will our SERIES OF SHOTS as Bishop Wilkes now steps up to the casket and faces the gathering.
CLOSER ANGLE=>Before the Bishop begins, he looks with confusion at Dave standing with Julie’s hand on his. But Dave can’t, or won’t look at him, so he turns his attention to Julie.
BISHOP WILKES=>But for those of us left behind, we’re always left with a single question... “Why?” Folks, there are no easy answers to “why?” All we can do is turn to God and say, “I don’t understand why this happening. What do I do now?”
HIS POV=>Clarice, dressed in black, limps up on her cane close enough to listen, but not far enough to be part of the gathering.
BACK TO SCENE=>The Bishop looks at Dave who is still looking down and is clearly unaware of Clarice’s presence. He thinks for a long beat, then opens up his Bible.
BISHOP WILKES=>“It is better to have a partner than go through life alone.”
ANGLE ON DAVE=>He’s jolted to attention by what he’s hearing, remembering.
ANGLE ON CLARICE=>She’s listening, too, trying to remember something from a long time ago.
ANGLE BACK WITH GATHERING=>The Bishop continues the reading. BISHOP WILKES
HIS POV=>Now he also sees Clarice standing near a tree, looking straight at him. And she gives him a tearful nod.
BACK TO SCENE=>Dave doesn’t know what to do with his feelings and the Bishop has not missed this connection. He turns back to Julie.
THEIR POV=>The firmament in all its glory. A billion shining diamonds.
BACK TO SCENE=>They are both looking up in wonder. Julie is still in her black funeral dress. Dave notices that she’s shivering.
CLOSER ANGLE=>Carlos is leading off at third base while Dave is coaching third, Brock is coaching first, and the rest of the East Side team is biting their nails in the dugout.
ANGLE IN THE BLEACHERS=>Clarice is sitting in the front row. She shakes a little NOISE-MAKER.
BACK TO SCENE=>The opposing pitcher goes into his windup, and here comes the pitch, and Darius talks the biggest swing of his life -- BIG FOUL BALL. The CROWD MOANS.
VARIOUS ANGLES=>As a ROAR goes up in the bleachers, the East Side boys all pour out of the dugout and pile on Carlos at home plate. A dirty, dusty human pyramid. Dave and Brock run in and jump on the pile. Lots of high- fives and AD LIBBED celebrations.
ANGLE BY FIRST BASE=>Darnell is examing Carlos’ glove.
ANGLE IN BLEACHERS=>Brock climbs the last few steps and straddles the row right below Julie. She looks a little melancholy.
ANGLE IN DUGOUT=>As Dave packs up the gear, Clarice watches from the bench.
