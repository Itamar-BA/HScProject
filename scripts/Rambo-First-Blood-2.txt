RAMBO=>Nothing is over!!!
VOICE=>John Rambo?
PRISON GUARD=>Follow me...
TRAUTMAN=>How've you been, Johnny?
TRAUTMAN=>That's all... Thanks.
TRAUTMAN=>I'm sorry you were sent to such a hellhole.
TRAUTMAN=>You have... haven't you...
RAMBO=>Yeah.
TRAUTMAN=>Johnny... I told you I'd help you when I could... you interested?
TRAUTMAN=>You can't possibly want to stay in prison for another five years?
RAMBO=>... In here I know where I stand.
TRAUTMAN=>Hear me out first. A covert operation is being geared up in the Far East. The computer dug out your name as one of the top three able to accomplish the mission.
RAMBO=>What mission?
TRAUTMAN=>Recon for P.O.W.'s in Nam.
RAMBO=>Why me?
TRAUTMAN=>The prison camp you escaped from in '71 is the target area -- no one knows that terrain better than you. The risk factor is very high.
TRAUTMAN=>Good. I'll get the necessary clearances, and the next time we'll meet, it'll be in Thailand with Special OP's designate who will honch the operation. All clear?
TRAUTMAN=>I want you to know I did what I could to keep you out of here.
RAMBO=>I know.
RAMBO=>Sir... Do we get to win this time?
TRAUTMAN=>This time it's up to you.
ERICSON=>You can take them off.
ERICSON=>How ya doing, Rambo, I'm Ericson.
ERICSON=>So you're the chosen one. You don't remember me do ya? We were in boot camp together in '63. You went Forces, I went Rangers... haven't been stateside since '72. Plenty of work here.
ERICSON=>You've made a hell of a rep back in Nam. Anyway, I'm glad to be workin' with ya, and... this place may not be heaven, but at least you're out of prison.
RAMBO=>... Am I?
ERICSON=>Pretty soon we'll all be out of a job. Somebody oughta blow it to hell and keep fightin' simple.
TRAUTMAN=>There he is -- 'morning, John.
RAMBO=>... Sir.
TRAUTMAN=>This is Marshall Murdock, he is in charge of special operations from Washington.
MURDOCK=>None except for this damn heat, right? Never felt anything like it. Anyway, let's get down to business -- Rambo, I glanced through your files and I must say it provided interesting reading. Rambo, John J., born 7/6/47 Bowie, Arizona of Indian-Italian-German descent. Joined army 8/6/64. Accepted, Special Forces specialization, light weapons, crossed-trained as medic. Helicopter and language qualified -- 59 confirmed kills --
MURDOCK=>... two Silver Stars, four Bronze, four Purple Hearts, Distinguished Service Cross, and the Medal of Honor... You did get around, didn't you... incredible. Now you're probably aware that there are still nearly twenty-five hundred Americans missing in action in Southeast Asia. Most of these boys are presumed killed. But to the League of Families -- Congress, and to a lot of Americans, it's still a very emotional issue. Get me something cold, please.
MURDOCK=>Rambo, you certainly don't know as much about me as I do about you, but I was honching with the Second Battalion, Third Marines at Kom Tum in sixty-six and lost a lot of good men, so I know what you and every Vet feels. Maybe the government didn't care, maybe certain sectors of the public didn't care but my committee cares. It may have been a bad war, but the men weren't bad.
TRAUTMAN=>So what his committee needs is conclusive proof that Americans are being held.
MURDOCK=>And once done, you can be assured we'll get our men back... If there's any of our men left at the P.O.W. targer camp you'll confirm their presence by taking photographs.
RAMBO=>Photographs?
MURDOCK=>Just photographs. Then you turn those photos over to me.
MURDOCK=>Not exactly -- the phrase two Delta Force assault team led by Colonel Trautman will handle the extraction.
MURDOCK=>Anyway, I want to say that with your participation I feel this mission has a better than average chance of succeeding where others have failed... I'll meet you both at the operations center in one hour.
TRAUTMAN=>Let's move.
TRAUTMAN=>From Thailand, across Laos, into the mountains of Vietnam to the drop zone. You'll be flying a ceiling of 250 feet when you bail out, can you handle it?
TRAUTMAN=>The code name for the insertion and extraction flight team is "Dragonfly"; home base "Wolf Den," your code name if "Lone Wolf." Since you're going solo, you are going to have to rely upon more equipment than you've ever used before, and use it -- so what I'm sayin' is, don't try the "blood and guts" routine, let technology do most of the work. If you need assistance, call for it.
RAMBO=>Let your fingers do the walking.
TRAUTMAN=>... Affirmative.
TRAUTMAN=>... There's your ride.
TRAUTMAN=>All of this is for you.
MURDOCK=>Impressed?
MURDOCK=>Besides the monitoring devices you see here, you'll be issued every ultra-modern piece of equipment to insure your safety. Rambo, you can feel totally safe because today we have the most advanced weapons in the world available to us.
RAMBO=>I believe the mind is the best weapon.
MURDOCK=>... Times change.
RAMBO=>For some people.
ERICSON=>... Amen.
MURDOCK=>This is true -- Don't let me interrupt, Colonel --
TRAUTMAN=>Upon insertion, call in to base camp by Transat -- proceed to Point Hawk September for rendezvous with ground contact -- indigenous agent Co Bao.
MURDOCK=>Is he listening?
RAMBO=>... Indigenous agent Co Bao.
MURDOCK=>Colonel, are you sure he's not still unbalanced from the war? We can't afford to have anyone involved who might crack under pressure in that hell.
TRAUTMAN=>Pressure? Let me just say that Rambo's the best combat Vet I've ever seen. A pure fighting machine with only a desire, to win a war someone else lost, and if winning means he has to die, he'll die. No fear. No regrets... one more thing... what you choose to call "Hell", he calls home.
LOUDSPEAKER=>D-minus 10 minutes.
ERICSON=>The Prince of Darkness.
LIFER=>What?
ERICSON=>That was his nickname in Nam -- 'Prince of Darkness'. At night he'd go out alone and hunt Cong, then come back at dawn... no questions asked. Man has style.
TRAUTMAN=>Thirty-six hours to get the hell in and out, so don't stop to smell the roses, okay? If there is any trouble, try like hell to get to the Hawk September extraction sight marked on your map.
ERICSON=>Ready to roll, Colonel.
TRAUTMAN=>Good luck, son.
RAMBO=>Remember when Murdock said he was with Second Battalion, Third Marines at Kom Tum in '66...
RAMBO=>The Second Battalion was at Kud Sank.
LIFER=>All set?
RAMBO=>Yeah.
LIFER=>Let's go.
TRAUTMAN=>Think he'll find someone?
MURDOCK=>P.O.W.'s... doubtful... but there's people to satisfy. Questions that have to be answered.
TRAUTMAN=>You don't sound too emotional about it.
MURDOCK=>It wasn't my war, Colonel. I'm just here to clean up the mess.
TECHNICIAN=>AWACS two-five has acquired. They are holding time line... Affirmative Wolf Den... Over.
ERICSON=>Back in the Badlands, my man.
LIFER=>... Party time.
ERICSON=>Stand by your position -- insertion, minus fifteen seconds.
ERICSON=>Five seconds, four, three, two. Jumper away.
ERICSON=>Shit! What's happening?
LIFER=>He's hung up!
ERICSON=>He'll be torn apart!!
TRAUTMAN=>What's happening?!
ERICSON=>Condition Red! He's hung up!?
MURDOCK=>What do you mean "hung up"?!
ERICSON=>He's being dragged! Lifer cut him loose.
LIFER=>Can't reach him! -- pull out before we get killed!!
MURDOCK=>Ericson, abort mission! Pull out!
ERICSON=>It'll kill him to change course!
LIFER=>Pull out you bastard! Climb!
LIFER=>He's out!
ERICSON=>... Out where?
ERICSON=>What's happened back there?
LIFER=>... Malfunction.
TECHNICIAN=>Nothing's coming in from Rambo.
TRAUTMAN=>Dragonfly, this is Wolf Den, over. Dragonfly, do you read?
ERICSON=>This is Dragonfly One, over.
TRAUTMAN=>Any visual bearings?
ERICSON=>... Negative.
ERICSON=>We didn't see anything.
MURDOCK=>Maybe the smart thing to do is abort the mission now before there's any more complications. I mean who could've survived something like that?
TRAUTMAN=>He's got to be given the benefit of the doubt. He has 36 hours to carry out the mission and reach the extraction site, we owe him that.
MURDOCK=>... Of course we do -- but understand in 36 hours we pull out.
CO=>Don't kill me!
CO=>Let me go, please!
RAMBO=>Who are you?
CO=>Co Bao -- Are you the one they send? Rambo?
CO=>I was hiding -- you did not come on time. I thought you one of mercenaries still here. You did not expect a woman, no? Better speak English, yes?
RAMBO=>We better get moving.
CO=>Yes, we go to river... Why you so late?
RAMBO=>... Got hung up.
CO=>I have arranged transportation down river -- old routes not safe.
CO=>Salt of the earth, yes?
RAMBO=>Pirates?
CO=>Best way down river -- not get army suspicious.
KINH=>Wa-ky number one. You come number one sampan.
CO=>Thank you, Captain, for your hospitality.
KINH=>This is the man who wants to go down river. You speak Viet?
CO=>He does not understand.
KINH=>You have money?
CO=>Half now... half later.
KINH=>We leave now. It's safer -- ... Want a drink? Good for you.
RAMBO=>What about patrol boats?
KINH=>We will have no problems.
CO=>You want to rest?
CO=>That settles that -- we eat, yes?
CO=>You're welcome.
CO=>No, you eat -- How you get into this?
RAMBO=>Long story.
CO=>Long ride.
RAMBO=>How about you?
CO=>My father work for intelligence agency -- He killed, and I take his place -- Too much death here. Death everywhere... I just want to live, Rambo. What you want?
RAMBO=>... To win, to survive.
CO=>... To survive.
CO=>Not so easy to survive here -- Still war here.
RAMBO=>... To survive war, you have to become war.
CO=>That why they pick you because you
RAMBO=>... I'm expendable.
CO=>Ex-pend-a-ble?
RAMBO=>Know what it means?
CO=>Don't tell me... It mean if you invited to party and you do not show up, it does not matter? Yes?
CO=>It bring me good luck -- What bring you good luck?
TRAUTMAN=>Any further reports?
MURDOCK=>None so far.
TRAUTMAN=>I want to go out with the extraction team at dawn.
MURDOCK=>Denied.
TRAUTMAN=>Denied?
MURDOCK=>It's too dangerous.
ERICSON=>He deserves a chance.
MURDOCK=>Colonel, we're a team here. It's everyone's worry -- I just think all things considered it's an unnecessary risk.
TRAUTMAN=>We have a schedule to keep.
MURDOCK=>With who? We don't even know if Rambo's alive.
LIFER=>The odds are against it.
TRAUTMAN=>Look, you said we go through as planned.
MURDOCK=>But, if you want to go through with it, we will!
CO=>You wait here... We come back, then pay rest...
CO=>... Looks empty.
CO=>We should move closer.
CO=>Cyclo-girl whore from village. Business slow there. She makes him good deal... very good deal.
CO=>What is it?
RAMBO=>A bow -- no sound.
CO=>That all you have?
CO=>You not going in there? -- But I thought you were supposed only to take pictures.
RAMBO=>Out here orders stop and people start.
RAMBO=>Come to get you out --
PRISONER=>... You American?
RAMBO=>Don't talk -- don't move.
RAMBO=>... We'll come back.
RAMBO=>Let's move.
RAMBO=>Can you walk?
BANKS=>I think so --
BANKS=>Who are you?
CO=>He is Rambo. I am Co.
BANKS=>Banks -- Lieutenant -- Air Force.
CO=>... We must get to the river... Fast!
BANKS=>... Thank you... you're a miracle.
TECH=>You have clearance.
TRAUTMAN=>Minus one hour to extraction.
ERICSON=>We're probably just wasting fuel.
TRAUTMAN=>Let's get moving!
CO=>L.Z. two K's up river.
BANKS=>Good thing you came when you did.
CO=>Why's that.
BANKS=>They move us around a lot... to harvest crops. Only been there a week.
RAMBO=>Only a week?
BANKS=>... Yes.
CO=>When last time you in camp here?
BANKS=>Maybe a year... Hey, what year is it?
CO=>... 1984... Camp supposed to be empty?
CO=>Something not good about mission, uh, Rambo?
CO=>What has happened?
RAMBO=>We're sold out.
KINH=>Whore!
RAMBO=>Get to the shore!
RAMBO=>Take him and jump!
CO=>... Knew you were a good man.
RAMBO=>... Let's move.
RAMBO=>... I won't be needin' it now... Trade you.
RAMBO=>There's explosives in the pouch.
CO=>... It better I stay till end.
RAMBO=>This is the end.
CO=>... I want to stay... Now we have chance, why don't you take me back?
RAMBO=>Where?
CO=>America... You can do if you want -- take me back as wife... You don't have to live with. Just help me get away from this.
RAMBO=>I came for P.O.W.'s -- How would it look if I came back with a wife?
CO=>What the matter? Not allow to feel -- maybe dead inside already. Don't we die soon enough. Just thought I'd ask.
CO=>Rambo... you not expendable.
RAMBO=>... Let's go.
ERICSON=>Three minutes.
TRAUTMAN=>That's Rambo! -- Christ, he's found one. Relay the command. Rambo's found one of ours!
TELECOM TECH=>Mr. Murdock... I have an AWACS relay. Dragonfly reports the ground team has what appears to be an American P.O.W. with them.
MURDOCK=>What did you say?
TELECOM TECH=>They've got one of ours.
MURDOCK=>This station is now on Condition Bravo. Harrison! Meyers! Goodell! Out... now!
MURDOCK=>Go to your COMINT priority push. Give me the mike... Dragonfly, this is Wolf Den Six. This is an Alpha- Kilo-Victor command priority.
ERICSON=>Roger, Wolf Den Six... go ahead.
MURDOCK=>I want you to abort the operation immediately. I say again, abort.
ERICSON=>Say again, Wolf Den Six.
ERICSON=>I've been ordered to abort before pickup.
TRAUTMAN=>He must be crazy! Confirm it!
ERICSON=>Confirmation's not necessary.
TRAUTMAN=>... Murdock, for Christ sake, we have them in sight! Murdock! Do you read?!! We're going down.
LIFER=>You're not going anywhere.
TRAUTMAN=>What the Hell are you doing?!
ERICSON=>Can't do that.
TRAUTMAN=>That's an order!
TRAUTMAN=>Goddamn mercenaries! There's men down there! Our men!
LIFER=>Not our men, your men! Don't be a hero.
LIFER=>... Don't.
TRAUTMAN=>What're you doing? Do you know what the hell you've done?!!
TRAUTMAN=>Don't ever count me with you and your scum. It was a lie, wasn't it? Just like the whole damn war, a lie!
MURDOCK=>What are you talking about?
TRAUTMAN=>The camp was supposed to be empty. Rambo goes in... a former decorated Vet. He finds no P.O.W.'s. The Congress buys it, case closed. If he gets caught, no one knows he's alive except you and your computers, and you can reprogram that, can't you?
MURDOCK=>Who do you think you're talking to, Trautman?
TRAUTMAN=>A stinking bureaucrat trying to cover his ass!
MURDOCK=>Not just mine, Trautman, a nation's! It was your hero's fault. If your "warrior" had done what the hell he was told, we'd be out of this clean and simple. All he was supposed to do is to take pictures!
TRAUTMAN=>And if the pictures showed something they would've been lost, wouldn't
MURDOCK=>Look, I don't think you understand what this is all about, Trautman!
TRAUTMAN=>Same as it always is, money. In '72 we were supposed to pay the "Cong" four and a half billion in war reparations, we reneged, and they kept the P.O.W.'s, and now you're doing it all over again!
MURDOCK=>And what the hell would you suggest we do if some burnt-out P.O.W. shows up on the six o'clock news -- fight the war all over again? Have an invasion! Bomb Hanoi? Do you think anybody is going to get on the floor of the United States Senate and ask billions of dollars for a couple of forgotten ghosts!
TRAUTMAN=>Men! Men who died for their country, you bastard!
MURDOCK=>Enough, I'm going to forget this meeting ever took place, and I'd advise you to never make the mistake of bringing this subject up again.
TRAUTMAN=>You're the one who's making the mistake...
MURDOCK=>What "mistake?"
TRAUTMAN=>... Rambo.
PODOVSK=>These people are so vulgar in their methods. They lack compassion. I am Lieutenant Podovsk. I do not know who you are yet -- But I will. ... Inside.
P.O.W.=>He's dead now.
PODOVSK=>In the chair.
PODOVSK=>Thank you, Captain Vinh. Leave one guard please.
PODOVSK=>Pride is a poor substitute for intelligence... Well, no matter. What you must understand is that we have to interrogate you. We will find out what you were doing.
PODOVSK=>To Sergeant Yushin, you are a piece of meat, a laboratory experiment. To me, you are a comrade similar to myself just opposed by a matter of fate.
PODOVSK=>I know you were trying to facilitate the release of war criminals held by this republic. I can appreciate this --
PODOVSK=>But this -- your capture -- this
PODOVSK=>No? You wish to test your strength -- very good. Proceed.
PODOVSK=>The name --
PODOVSK=>Comrade, here is something you might be interested in.
PODOVSK=>A transcript of the conversation between your helicopter pilot and his commander we intercepted. Mmmm. "Dragonfly... Slam Dunk." Colorful names. Here we are -- "Ah, Coach One... we have them in sight." And the reply -- "Abort the operation immediately. Return to base camp."
PODOVSK=>It seems they abandoned you on direct orders. These are the people you protect with your pain? -- You may scream. There is no shame.
PODOVSK=>Good... You are strong -- The strongest so far -- but you are nearly dead -- for what? Make the radio call... yes?
PODOVSK=>Yushin has a memento for you of this occasion.
PODOVSK=>... Put it in his eye.
PODOVSK=>If your life means nothing, perhaps his does.
PODOVSK=>You will talk.
PODOVSK=>... Yes?
BANKS=>Don't say nothin'! Do what you want.
PODOVSK=>... Yes?
PODOVSK=>Only fools die for a lost cause.
PODOVSK=>I trust you know the proper transmit coordinates, yes?
PODOVSK=>You will state your name -- that you've been captured as a spy! You will state that the mission was a failure and all missions will fail. Tell them not to attempt such hostile aggression again. Do you understand?
BANKS=>Don't do it!
PODOVSK=>Do it now!
RAMBO=>... 220-56 Lone Wolf -- receive.
BANKS=>Don't --
RAMBO=>Wolf Den -- This is... Lone Wolf -- do you read? Over.
RADIO OPERATOR=>Lone Wolf! This is Wolf Den. Transmit location and status, over.
MURDOCK=>What is it?!
RADIO OPERATOR=>... It's Rambo, sir.
RADIO=>We read you, Lone Wolf -- what is your position -- over.
RADIO OPERATOR=>What's your position, over?
PODOVSK=>... Your position will be death if you do not answer.
TRAUTMAN=>John, this is Trautman -- where the hell are you?
TRAUTMAN=>Johnny, come in!
RAMBO=>... Murdock.
TRAUTMAN=>He's here!
MURDOCK=>Rambo -- This is Murdock -- we're glad you're alive... where are you? Give us your position and we'll come and get you, over.
RAMBO=>... Murdock, I'm coming to get you.
RAMBO=>This way!
PODOVSK=>Find! Now!
PODOVSK=>Find and kill him.
CO=>... We safe for now -- you look like hell, Rambo.
RAMBO=>Tough night.
CO=>... maybe need this again.
CO=>You hurt bad... Not so in-vo-nerable after all.
RAMBO=>... No.
CO=>You rest a while, I watch.
RAMBO=>... I'll watch.
CO=>... What you do, Rambo? Try to get across to Thailand?
RAMBO=>Yes.
CO=>Then America.
CO=>You take me with you, Rambo? I give you one more chance.
RAMBO=>... You don't know me.
CO=>I know enough -- you take me?
CO=>I think you make a good choice.
RAMBO=>... Yeah. Better move.
RAMBO=>... No!!!
CO=>... You good man, Rambo... good. Not forget me.
MURDOCK=>Do you really think that you can threaten me, Colonel?
TRAUTMAN=>I want the rescue team ready to go in one hour.
TRAUTMAN=>... Yes, I do.
MURDOCK=>I'm giving you a direct order to withdraw from this project.
TRAUTMAN=>Do I get the rescue team, or do I have to go over your head?
MURDOCK=>Colonel, it's time you understand I'm in charge here -- here you're a tool, we're the machine -- I want him placed under arrest. He's not to leave the base.
TRAUTMAN=>He never had a chance did he?
MURDOCK=>... Like you said, he went home.
TAY=>We got him!
VINH=>You see? Not a demon. A man. Now, we find where he's crawled to die.
VINH=>Everyone back!!
RAMBO=>Here!
YUSHIN=>Drop the napalm!
YUSHIN=>Goddamn him!!
ERICSON=>It's time...
MURDOCK=>Yeah. Alert everyone, start packing, we're pulling out now.
TRAUTMAN=>You're what?
MURDOCK=>It's finished, Colonel...
RAMBO=>Let's go!
BANKS=>That's Thailand?
BANKS=>We're home! We're home!
RAMBO=>Lone Wolf to Wolf Den -- Do you read?
TECH=>We hear you, Lone Wolf. Come in.
RAMBO=>Prepare for emergency landing. Arriving with American P.O.W.'s! Over?
TRAUTMAN=>You heard. Prepare for arriving P.O.W.'s.
RAMBO=>We win... you lose! Mission Accomplished!
BANKS=>... Thanks.
TRAUTMAN=>John... Where are you going?
RAMBO=>... I don't know.
TRAUTMAN=>You'll get a second medal of honor for this.
RAMBO=>You should give it to them... They deserve it more.
TRAUTMAN=>You can't keep running. You're free now... Come back with us.
TRAUTMAN=>John, the war, everything that happened here may have been wrong, but dammit, John, you can't hate your country for it.
RAMBO=>Hate? -- I'd die for it.
TRAUTMAN=>Then, what is it you want?
RAMBO=>What do I want? I want what they want... And what every other guy who came over here and spilled his guts and gave everything he had wants... for our country to love us as much as we love it... That's what I want. And that's what they wanted.
TRAUTMAN=>How will you live, John?
RAMBO=>Day by day.
