TYRONE=>Sheeit, this mutha startin' to look a little seedy, man.
HARRY=>What's the matter, ya particular all of a sudden?
TYRONE=>Hey, baby, ah don't care if it's growin' hair just so's we get our braid.
MR RABINOWITZ=>So look, the table too already.
HARRY=>Hey, what do you want from me? I can't schlep it on my back.
MR RABINOWITZ=>You got a friend.
TYRONE=>Hey man, I ain't my leper's schlepper.
MR RABINOWITZ=>Such a son. A goniff. Your mother needs you like a moose needs a hat rack.
TYRONE=>Sheeit, that's some boss scag, baby. I mean DYN-A-MITE.
HARRY=>Yeah, man, something else.
TYRONE=>Ya know what we oughta do, man?
TYRONE=>Huh? We oughta get a piece of this Brody shit and cut it and off it, ya dig?
HARRY=>This stuff's good enough to cut in half and still get you wasted. We could double our money. Easy.
TYRONE=>That's right. An' then we buy a couple a pieces an' we got something' else goin', man. It sure would be righteous.
HARRY=>In no time we'd get a pound of pure straight from Sal the Geep.
TYRONE=>No hassles. That's all I want, no hassles.
WAITRESS=>Can I get you a -
COP=>Hey! Hey!
WAITRESS=>Anything else? Huh?
WAITRESS=>Well.
HARRY=>No, no. Just the check.
MR RABINOWITZ=>Good evening, Mrs Goldfarb.
SARA=>Good evening, Mr Rabinowitz, though I'm not so sure how good it is. And you?
MR RABINOWITZ=>Uh, so what can I say? Are you wanting your TV?
SARA=>Yes, if you don't mind.
MR RABINOWITZ=>Mrs Goldfarb, can I ask you a question, you won't be taking it personal?
MR RABINOWITZ=>How many years we know each other? Who's to count? Why don't you tell already the police so maybe they could talk to Harry and he wouldn't be stealing no more the TV.
SARA=>Oooo, Mr Rabinowitz, I couldn't, Harold's my only child. He's all I have.
OLD LADY=>Hello? Who is it?
OLD LADY=>Who?
MARION=>What do we do now?
SARA=>Hello?
CHEERY VOICE=>Mrs Goldfarb? Mrs Sara Goldfarb?
SARA=>It's me. Speaking.
SARA=>I'm not interested in -
CHEERY VOICE=>Wait, Mrs Goldfarb. I'm not selling anything. Nothing. I just want to offer you a chance to be on television.
SARA=>Television?
CHEERY VOICE=>That's right, Mrs Goldfarb.
SARA=>Look, I don't have any -
CHEERY VOICE=>I'm not looking for money, Mrs Goldfarb. I'm calling to tell you you've already won. Your name was selected from a long list of available contestants. You've been chosen and you now have an opportunity to be on television.
SARA=>Me? On television?
LYLE RUSSEL=>That's right, Mrs Goldfarb. You on television.
SARA=>I never thought I'd be on television. I'm just a -
LYLE RUSSEL=>Malin & Block discovers contestants for most of America's favorite television shows.
SARA=>Ooooooo... Me... me... on... oh I can't...
LYLE RUSSEL=>Yes, Mrs Goldfarb, you. Congratulations! I can't tell you why you are so lucky, but you are. Congratulations!
LYLE RUSSEL=>You will receive all necessary information in the mail, Mrs Goldfarb. Goodbye and... God bless.
HARRY=>... but why you so hard on your folks? I mean, they give you the bread for rent, money for the shrink -
MARION=>They bug me. They're fucking hypocrites.
MARION=>Like they're in that big house with all their cars and money. They pay me off so they don't have to deal with me. They pay off charities to deal with their racism. Then we'll see how liberal they are when I come home with a black guy.
HARRY=>You know what you gotta do.
MARION=>Yeah.
HARRY=>You gotta get away from them.
MARION=>How?
HARRY=>What about your clothes? Maybe you could sell them. Open a store.
MARION=>I can't.
HARRY=>Why?
MARION=>When will I have time to hang with you?
ADA=>So where's the party?
SARA=>Party, schmarty. This is like all the parties. When I tell you, you'll jump out the window.
ADA=>A basement window, I hope.
ADA=>Well, I have a great diet book.
SARA=>Zophtic.
HARRY=>Marion!
MARION=>They're coming.
TAPPY TIBBONS=>Now, let's meet our next winner.
SARA=>Ech, what a smell. That's the Gawanus Canal?
ADA=>Just relax, Dolly, you got a long way to go. You'll get used to it.
SARA=>Get used to it? I'm almost losing my appetite.
SARA=>When's lunch?
ADA=>Sweetie, we're lucky if we're finished before supper.
SARA=>So long?
ADA=>That's right. With you we're starting from scratch one.
SARA=>And I thought I would catch a little sun today.
ADA=>In a box you'll catch it. You just relax and think how gorgeous you'll look with your red hair. Today the hair, tomorrow the sun.
MARION=>Anybody wanna waste some time?
HARRY=>I'm starving.
TYRONE=>Yeah, me too, get me a Snickers.
HARRY=>Damn, Ty, don't you eat anything except Snickers?
TYRONE=>Yeah, Chuckles. Ah digs Chuckles.
HARRY=>What you need is some good noodle soup.
TYRONE=>Sheeit, Pepsi and Snickers'll take care of anything.
HARRY=>And maybe some bread.
TYRONE=>I prefer the type that goes in my pocket not my mouth.
HARRY=>Exactly. Angel told me about a job --
TYRONE=>A job! Hah!
MARION=>What? You lose a bet?
TYRONE=>Damn, this is a righteous chick, Jim.
HARRY=>No, we got this idea. Tyrone has this connection, Brody, with some dynamite shit. If we can get some cash together we can get a piece, cut it up and make a fortune.
TYRONE=>Soon we could get a pound of pure and retire.
HARRY=>We'd get off hard knocks and be on easy street.
MARION=>What's the catch?
SARA=>That's red?
ADA=>Well, it's not exactly red but it's almost, maybe, in the same family.
SARA=>The same family? They're not even distant cousins already.
ADA=>It's a red. Not a red red, but a red.
SARA=>Red? You're telling me this is a red?
ADA=>Yeah. I'm telling. It's a red.
SARA=>Then what's orange? If this is a red I want to know what's orange.
ADA=>Well, it could be a little orange,
SARA=>A little orange? It's a little orange like being a little pregnant.
ADA=>So what's to worry? It'll be alright.
SARA=>What's to worry? Someone may try to juice me.
ADA=>Relax, relax, Dolly. It just needs a little more dye. It'll be alright for television.
SARA=>All day long, I'm getting my scalp scraped and burned and smelling like dead fish and I look like a basketball.
ADA=>Relax. You should learn to relax.
HARRY=>You know something? I've always thought you are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
MARION=>Really?
HARRY=>Since the first time I met you.
MARION=>That's nice, Harry. That really makes me feel good.
HARRY=>Good for your ego, eh?
MARION=>Well, I can't say that it does it any harm, but that's not what I mean. It makes me feel good all over, like...well, you know lots of people tell me that and it's meaningless, completely meaningless.
HARRY=>You mean because you think they're putting you on?
MARION=>No, no, nothing like that. I don't know or care if they are. I guess maybe they really mean it, but from them it just doesn't mean anything to me. When you say it, I hear it. You know what I mean? I really hear it.
HARRY=>Someone like you could really make it alright for me.
MARION=>You think?
HARRY=>Yeah. I've been thinking...
MARION=>What?
HARRY=>Here.
MARION=>What?
MARION=>What is it?
HARRY=>You remember when I told you about the store. Well, I've been thinking about it. I put together some numbers and it's not impossible. I think you can do it. We should do it. We can do it together.
MARION=>How long have you been thinking about this?
HARRY=>Not so long. Since we started hanging out.
MARION=>It's a great idea.
HARRY=>Yeah?
MARION=>It is. Let's do it. Let's open it in the city. How do we start?
HARRY=>Well, first me and Ty gotta get money for the piece and then --
MARION=>I'll get it.
HARRY=>Nah.
MARION=>No, I can.
HARRY=>Really? How?
MARION=>How do you think? My fucking parents.
HARRY=>I think I'm falling in love with you.
MARION=>Think?
HARRY=>Marion, Marion, I love you.
SARA=>Stop already. You'll feel better in the red dress than a cheese danish.
RAE=>Ada told us. It's gorgeous.
SARA=>Thank you. We're making it a little darker tomorrow.
RAE=>So why darker?
SARA=>To match my red dress.
RAE=>But now it's looking like Lucille Ball.
SARA=>But I'm not. But soon...I'm on a diet.
ADA=>Yes, she is.
RAE=>What diet you on?
SARA=>Eggs and grapefruit.
RAE=>Oi vay. I was on that once. Lots of luck, Dolly.
SARA=>It's not so bad.
RAE=>How long you been on already?
SARA=>All day.
RAE=>All day? It's one o'clock.
SARA=>So, I'm thinking thin.
MRS SCARLINI=>My Rosie lost fifty pounds like that almost.
SARA=>Like what?
MRS SCARLINI=>Poof.
RAE=>You put her in a sweat box?
MRS SCARLINI=>A doctor. He gave her pills. It makes you not want to eat.
MRS SCARLINI=>With a slice of onion and mustard.
ADA=>You shouldn't talk like that when someone's on a diet.
SARA=>Eh, big deal. I'll sneak an extra piece of lettuce. I'm thinking thin.
RAE=>The mailman...
SARA=>Goldfarb. Goldfarb. I know you have something for Goldfarb.
MAILMAN=>Let's see. Not much around here except at the beginning of the month with the social security checks.
SARA=>But I'm expecting something --
MAILMAN=>Here we go. Something for Goldfarb, Sara Goldfarb.
ADA=>So let's see.
RAE=>So when do you go on?
SARA=>They decide after you send this form.
ADA=>Oh, it's so exciting.
ADA=>OK, OK. You sit, Dolly and just answer the questions.
ADA=>Name? Easy enough. S-a-r-a G-o-l-d- f-a-r-b.
SARA=>You call that a question? That kind I take six at once.
ADA=>Address.
SARA=>A breeze.
ADA=>Uh-oh.
SARA=>What? What?
ADA=>Date of Birth.
SARA=>So now you're getting personal. OK, I'll tell you.
ADA=>Age?
SARA=>So now you want me to count for you!
ADA=>Marital Status?
SARA=>Wanting, needing. How about if I win Robert Redford?
ADA=>Sex?
SARA=>Please?
ADA=>That's it, Dolly.
SARA=>Who needs you?
ADA=>Maybe they'll send you to Tavern on the Green, that's where they send all the stars.
SARA=>I'm eating eggs and grapefruit at Tavern on the Green.
TYRONE=>Dynamite? Dynamite. Dynamite! Alright, we's on the way.
TYRONE=>Brody's man says it's real fine shit.
HARRY=>Alright. Here we go.
TYRONE=>Here we go.
HARRY=>Let's do this right.
TYRONE=>Naturally.
TYRONE=>There it is, Jim.
HARRY=>Huh?
TYRONE=>There it is.
TYRONE=>Shall we try?
HARRY=>Wait, Ty. This is our chance to make it big and I mean really big. We don't have to be dealin' in no petty-ass pieces all our lives. We play it right an' we can get a pound of pure, but if we get wasted we'll fuck it up.
TYRONE=>Right, on, baby, ahm not jivin' you. Ah doan' want to be runnin' no streets the res' of mah life in no ripped sneakers, mah nose runnin' down to mah chin. All we gotta do is have a little taste so we know how much to cut it.
HARRY=>Fair enough.
TYRONE=>Sheeit...
SARA=>Shut up!
MRS SCARLINI=>Hello?
SARA=>Louise, it's Sara. I need the number of that doctor.
HARRY=>Why do you have to see him for krist's sake? Cut the son of a bitch loose.
MARION=>I don't want him mentioning to my parents that I have stopped therapy. They're already pissed at me and they're thinking of cutting me off.
MARION=>Sweetheart, I am not going to sleep with him. He's got some issue with womanly blood so I told him I'm on the rag. He's planning on going home after the concert.
MARION=>Oh Harry, you're jealous!
MARION=>Come on, sweetheart, put your arms around me, come on, please!? Please!?
HARRY=>Come on, stop, stop you crazy girl or I'll bite you on the throat.
ARNOLD THE SHRINK=>I'm disappointed that you are indisposed.
MARION=>Is Anita out of town or something?
ARNOLD THE SHRINK=>Why do you ask?
MARION=>I'm just curious if she's 'indisposed'.
ARNOLD THE SHRINK=>Marion. No she's fine.
MARION=>Can I ask you something personal, Arnold?
ARNOLD THE SHRINK=>What is it?
HARRY=>We're on our way, baby, we're really on our way.
MARION=>Harry.
HARRY=>It was great out there. Everyone's thirsty.
MARION=>I'm so glad. And baby, I'm drawing again. I'm drawing. I can't stop.
SKINNY NURSE=>How are you?
SARA=>Fine, that's why I'm here.
SKINNY NURSE=>How's your hearing and vision?
SARA=>I have both.
SKINNY NURSE=>Now, wait just a minute.
DOCTOR PILL=>I see you're a little overweight.
SARA=>A little? I have fifty pounds I'm willing to donate.
DOCTOR PILL=>We can take care of that, no problem.
SARA=>Purple in the morning. Red in the afternoon. Orange in the evening. That's my three meals, Mr Smarty Pants. Green at night. Just like that. One, two, three, four...
HARRY=>Yeah, that's what I'll do.
MARION=>Huh?
MARION=>Well?
HARRY=>I finally asked myself, what's her fix? Television, right? If ever there's a TV junkie it's the old lady. I figure maybe I owe her a new one anyway with all the wear and tear her set got from being schlepped back and forth to old Abe's.
MARION=>You really love her, don't you?
HARRY=>I don't know. I guess so. One time I feel one way and the other time I feel something else. Most of the time I just want her to be happy.
MARION=>Let's go get it now.
HARRY=>Well...
MARION=>C'mon.
HARRY=>I don't wanna deal with salesman...
MARION=>Oh, come on.
HARRY=>Well, let's push off first.
MARION=>It's still early. We shouldn't get going till tonight.
ALICE=>Why dontcha come back to bed, honey?
TYRONE=>Sheeit, plenty time for that, woman, I got me a cool-ass toy ahm groovin' behind.
YOUNG TYRONE=>I told ya, Ma. One day I'd make it.
TYRONE'S MOTHER=>You don't have to make anything. You just gotta love your momma.
ALICE=>What are you doing, honey?
TYRONE=>Thinking about you, baby, and what I'm gonna do to ya.
ALICE=>Don't do that, Tyrone. You'll scare me to death.
TYRONE=>Oh little momma, I wouldn't want to scare you...I doan' want to scare nobody. All I want from life is no hassles and some peace and harmony...an' I want it from the finest fox that ever lived.
SARA=>Nothing yet.
ADA=>You can bring friends?
SARA=>How should I know?
ADA=>They should let you bring at least a schlepper. Who's going to carry home all those prizes?
SARA=>Believe me, I'll get them home. Especially Robert Redford. For him I don't need a schlepper.
SARA=>I love you forever. I can't believe it but I'm not even thinking of food. If you put down a big bowl of chicken noodle soup I wouldn't eat it. Thank you so much, Rosie. Thank you!
MAILMAN=>When I see it I'll be waving it all over the place.
SARA=>Harry!
HARRY=>Hey, take it easy, Ma, you'll crush me.
SARA=>Come, come inside, Harry. I'll make you a pot of coffee and we'll have a visit.
SARA=>And how are you, Harry, you're looking so good. You want something to eat?
HARRY=>No, Ma --
SARA=>A little nosh, maybe, or cake, I'll go get some if you want, but I don't have anything in the house but Ada will have something, a cupcake, maybe.
HARRY=>No --
SARA=>You want something to eat?
HARRY=>No, Ma. Nothing. Sit. Sit, for krist's sake. You're making me dizzy.
SARA=>You notice something? You notice I'm slimmer?
HARRY=>Yeah, yeah, I guess you are, Mom.
SARA=>Twenty-five pounds. You believe it? Twenty-five pounds and that's just the beginning.
HARRY=>That's great, Ma. That's really great, I'm really happy for ya. But sit down, eh?
HARRY=>I'm sorry I haven't been around for awhile, Ma, but I've been busy, real busy.
HARRY=>Yeah, Ma, real good.
SARA=>What kind of business?
HARRY=>Well, I'm sort of a distributor, like. For a big importer. My own.
SARA=>Oh, I'm so happy for you.
HARRY=>Hey, Ma, easy, eh? You're killing me. Krist, whatta ya been doin', liftin' weights?
SARA=>Your own business. Oh Harry, I knew when I saw you that you had your own business. I always knew that you could do that.
HARRY=>Yeah, Ma, you were right. I made it just like you said I would.
SARA=>So now maybe you'll meet a nice girl and have a baby?
HARRY=>I already met one --
HARRY=>Jesus krist, Ma, don't go ape shit, eh?
SARA=>Is she a nice girl? Who's her parents? What --

HARRY=>Before you go bouncin' all over again and make me forget, what I want to tell ya is I got you a present and --
SARA=>Harry, I don't want a present, just have a baby.
HARRY=>Later for that, eh? Will you let me tell you what I got, eh? Will ya?
HARRY=>Krist, you're really something else today. Look, I know... well... What I'm trying to say is that...well... Well...I know I ain't been the best son in the world --
SARA=>Oh, Harry, you're a good --
HARRY=>No, no! Please, Ma, let me finish. I'll never get it out if you keep interrupting me. I'm sorry for being such a bastard. I wanna make it up. I mean, I know I can't change anything that's happened, but I want ya to
HARRY=>know that I'm sorry and I love ya, and I wanna make it right.
SARA=>Harry, it's --
HARRY=>I don't know why I do those things. I don't really want to do them. It just sort've happens, I guess. I don't know. It's all kinda goofy somehow, but I really do love ya, Ma, and I want you to be happy so I got ya a brand new TV set. It's gonna be delivered in a couple a days. From Macy's.
SARA=>Oh, Harry, you're such a good boy. Your father would be so happy to see what you're doing for your poor, lonely mother.
SARA=>You see that, Seymour? You see how good your son is? He knows how lonely
HARRY=>Hey, Ma, you droppin' uppers?
SARA=>What?
HARRY=>You on uppers? You're on diet pills, ain't ya?
SARA=>On? On? What is on?
HARRY=>How come ya lost so much weight?
SARA=>I told you, I'm going to a specialist.
HARRY=>A specialist. What kinda specialist?
SARA=>What kind? A specialist. For weight.
HARRY=>Yeah, that's what I thought. You're makin' a croaker for speed, ain't ya?
SARA=>Harry, you alright?
HARRY=>What does he give ya, Ma? Eh? Does he give ya pills?
SARA=>Of course he gives me pills. He's a doctor. Doctors give pills.
HARRY=>What kind of pills?
SARA=>What kind. A purple one, red one, orange and --
HARRY=>No, no, I mean what kind?
SARA=>They're round...and flat.
HARRY=>I mean, like what's in them?
SARA=>Harry, I'm Sara Goldfarb, not Albert Einstein. How should I know what's in them?
HARRY=>Look, Ma, does that stuff make you feel good sort of and give you lots of pep?
SARA=>Well, I guess maybe a little.
HARRY=>A little? Jesus, I can hear ya grinding ya teeth from here.
SARA=>But that goes away at night.
SARA=>When I take the green one. In thirty minutes I'm asleep. Poof, just like that.
HARRY=>Hey, Ma, ya gotta cut that stuff loose. It's no good.
SARA=>Who said it's no good? Twenty-five pounds I lost.
HARRY=>Big deal. Do ya wanna be a dope fiend fa krist's sake?
SARA=>What's this dope fiend? Am I foaming at the mouth? He's a nice doctor.
HARRY=>Ma, I'm telling ya this croaker's no good.
SARA=>How come you know so much? How come you know more about medicine than a doctor?
HARRY=>I know, Ma, believe me, I know. You'll get strung out fa krist's sake.
SARA=>C'mon. I almost fit in my red dress, the one I wore at your high school graduation. The one your father liked so much. I remember how he looked at me in the red dress. It's not long after that he got sick and died and you're without a father, my poor baby, but thank God he saw you happy for a little and --
HARRY=>What's with the red dress? What does that --
SARA=>I'm going to wear the red dress on...Oh, you don't know. I'm going to be on television. I got a call and an application and --
HARRY=>C'mon, Ma, who's pullin' ya leg?
SARA=>I'm telling you I'm being a contestant on television. They haven't told me when, but you'll see, you'll be proud when you see your mother in her red dress and golden shoes on television.
HARRY=>What's the big deal about being on television? Those pills'll kill ya before ya ever get on, fa krist's sake.
SARA=>Big deal? You drove up in a cab. You see who had the sun seat? You notice your mother in the special spot getting the sun?
SARA=>You know who everybody talks to? You know who's somebody now? Who's no longer just a widow in a little apartment who lives alone? I'm somebody now, Harry. Everyone likes me. Soon millions of people will see me and like me. I'll tell them about you and your father. I'll tell them how your father liked the red dress and how good he was to us. Remember?
HARRY=>Robert Redford?
SARA=>So what's wrong with Robert Redford?
SARA=>It's not the prizes, Harry. It doesn't make any difference if I win or lose. It's like a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to lose weight so I can be healthy. It's a reason to fit in the red dress. It's a reason to smile, already. It makes tomorrow alright. What have I got, Harry? Why should I even make the bed or wash the dishes? I do them, but why should I? I'm alone. Seymour's gone, you're gone, I have no one to take care of. Anybody. Everybody. What do I have? I'm lonely, Harry. I'm old.
HARRY=>You got friends, Ma. What --
SARA=>It's not the same. You need someone to make for. No, Harry, I like how I feel this way. I like thinking about the red dress and the television...and your father and you. Now when I get the sun I smile.
HARRY=>I'll come visit, Ma. Now that I'm straight, my business is going good,
SARA=>Good, you bring her and I'll make your soup and a roast.
HARRY=>That sounds great, Ma. I'll give you a call ahead a time, OK?
SARA=>Good. I'm glad. I'm glad you got a nice girl and a good business. I'm glad.
SARA=>Your father and I were always wanting only the very best for you. I'm glad, Harry, that you have someone to be with. You should be healthy and happy. And have lots of babies. Don't have only one. It's no good. Have lots of babies. They'll make you happy.
SARA=>Look, I'm crying already. I'm so happy I'm crying.
HARRY=>I'm glad you're happy, Ma. I really love ya. An' I'm sorry --
SARA=>Don't worry about me. I'm used to being alone.
HARRY=>I got to go, Ma. I have an appointment in Manhattan in a little bit. But I'll be back.
SARA=>Good. I'll make for you. You still have your key?
HARRY=>Yeah, I got it, Ma. I'd better hurry. I'm late now.
SARA=>Goodbye, Son.
HENCHMAN=>Brody say you coming up quick, kid.
TYRONE=>Thanks, Brody.
HENCHMAN=>Brody wants to promote you. He wants to give you some more responsibility. Are you interested?
TYRONE=>Yeah, yeah.
HENCHMAN=>Brody say, you fuck him, I'll kill you.
TYRONE=>I wouldn't do that, Jim.
TYRONE=>Where's the --
MARION=>Oh Harry, I love you. You make me feel like a person, like I'm me and I'm beautiful.
HARRY=>You are beautiful. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. You're my dream.
SKINNY NURSE=>Doctor's office?
SARA=>Hello, this is Mrs Goldfarb
SKINNY NURSE=>No, Mrs Goldfarb, I'm absolutely certain. I've checked again.
SARA=>Are you sure you didn't give me the wrong pills?
SARA=>But maybe you gave me a smaller one the last time.
SKINNY NURSE=>That isn't possible, Mrs Goldfarb. You see, they are all the same potency. The change is in the color. All the purple are the same strength, all the red, etc.
SARA=>But something isn't the same.
SKINNY NURSE=>You're just becoming adjusted to them. At first you get a strong reaction, but after a while that wears off and you just don't feel like eating. It's nothing to worry about, Mrs Goldfarb.
TAPPY TIBBONS=>Now let's meet our next winner. She's a beautiful woman with a winning sense of humor and a magical smile. Straight from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, let's give a juicy welcome to Mrs Sara Goldfarb.
GUARD=>Love...Love, Tyrone C. Seven-three- five. Get your shit together and come on.
TYRONE=>How much?
HARRY=>They got most of our cash. You're up for consortin'.
TYRONE=>Sheeit.
HARRY=>Angel says it's a war between the Italians and the Blacks. He says Sal the Geep is keeping all the shit down in Florida until guys like Brody are all knocked off.
TYRONE=>Sheeit.
HARRY=>No one's got a thing.
TYRONE=>Except Big Tim.
HARRY=>Who?
TYRONE=>He's holdin' a nice taste.
HARRY=>How much?
TYRONE=>Some say a piece, others a truckload.
HARRY=>Shit. Let's go see him.
TYRONE=>He's holdin', but he's not sellin'. He's only givin' up for pussy.
HARRY=>What?
TYRONE=>The only habit that muthafuck have is pussy. He hooked on that thang. Ah told'im ah give'im all he want, but he say ahm not pretty enough for'im.
MARION=>Well, why don't we just stop using?
HARRY=>Yeah, I guess we'd better.

ARNOLD THE SHRINK=>To be perfectly straight, I was surprised to hear from you. Is something wrong?
MARION=>No, why?

HARRY=>Not if you're drivin'. Look man, it's colder than hell and those streets are hotter'n a bitch. After tonight...shit. Guys are gettin' knocked off like they're givin' away season tickets for every dead fiend.
TYRONE=>That's no lie, Jim.
HARRY=>Man, we got nothin' to lose, and we got to do it now while we still have a few bucks.
TYRONE=>If it's such a good idea why ain't somebody else thought of it?
HARRY=>Because they're assholes. And that's just it. Nobody else has thought of it. It's wide open and it we get there before anyone else we can name
TYRONE=>Las' summer was a ball, Jim...Seems like a thousan' years since las' summer. Sheeit.
HARRY=>It'll be back like that, but only better. This is the kinda set up you dream about.

MARION=>I don't give a shit. You loser. You fucking loser, I want you to come through for me.
HARRY=>Ya think I'm playin' fuckin' games, for krist's sake? You wanna have some extra stuff?
