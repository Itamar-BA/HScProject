CAROLYN=>I don’t hear anything.
ANDREA=>Were you calling me? ROGER
THE CLOSET=>Just as she begins to hang them up -- the noise of CREAKING WOOD draws her attention to the ceiling -- where it sounds like someone’s trying to walk quietly -- then it stops. She’s a little unnerved -- walks back out into
THE BEDROOM=>and crosses to a nearby window. Looks out to a tree, its leaves rustling in the wind. She cranes her head to see if any of the branches are touching the roof above the closet. Can’t tell. Just as she’s about to turn away, she notices Sadie down in the yard near the front porch below, nervously pacing back and forth.
CAROLYN=>I think you’re right.
ED=>That’s good, Jerome, why don’t you hit the lights --
ROGER=>Yeah, but I don’t know how much more we can afford.
CAROLYN=>...Does that mean you?
ANDREA=>What’s wrong, Kitty?
IN THE BED LATER=>Carolyn, who’s fallen asleep next to Andrea, awakens to a distant SCRATCHING NOISE. She listens for few beats -- there it is again. She climbs out of bed to investigate.
ANDREA=>Maybe it was the cat.
DAVID=>Creaking and moaning -- like someone’s in pain. RACHEL
RACHEL=>Ohmygod, that’s it --
LATER.=>Just as Cindy finishes her homework, her bedroom door begins to make a soft, repetitive bangbangbang noise -- like something’s pushing against it from the other side.
CAROLYN O.C.=>Excuse me, Father Thorton?
LORRAINE=>We were in Maine last week, New York the week before --
TAFT RD.=>Ed turns. Heads down a gravel strip of road that winds its way through the trees to a mailbox. They turn in the driveway. -- Although it’s dark and cloudy, scattered moonlight casts an eerie glow over the farmhouse -- we see it’s the Perron’s. Lights on inside splinter out through several windows. The Perron’s station wagon is out front. Ed pulls up and parks. As they get out of the car, he goes to the trunk. Pops it open. Lorraine suddenly stops cold -- her smile vanishes. She stands still -- slowly scans over the property; past the house, the woods, the barn -- something’s definitely got her attention. Ed retrieves a handheld tape recorder and note pad out of a box in the trunk and closes it. Goes up to Lorraine -- She shows him her arms -- has GOOSEBUMPS all over them.
CAROLYN=>-- You found it okay?
ED=>Yeah, no problem.
CINDY=>The one I saw. It was horrible, like rotting meat.
ED=>It usually indicates some kind of demonic activity.
CAROLYN=>About five months ago.
LORRAINE=>Do you feel like any one of these things want to hurt you?
ANDREA=>When I get Goose bumps, does that mean they’re near me?
SHANNON=>Maddy, finish cutting this for Mrs. Doornbos, will ya?
ROGER=>Of course they did.
LORRAINE=>Ed -- she hung herself at five fifteen in the morning.
BRUCE=>You might say that.
LORRAINE=>How are you holding up?
ED=>Well -- don’t mind us, we’ll only be a few minutes.
ROGER=>Knock yourself out.
LORRAINE=>Um-hum. We braid it every night before she goes to bed.
RIGHT AFTER=>All the Perrons surround Jerome at the monitors, watching Ed, Lorraine and Bruce entering the cellar -- you can hear a pin drop. Ed flips on the light.
BRUCE=>No -- still full.
JEROME=>We should have Lorraine see if she can connect with him.
LORRAINE=>Oh well, must be tuning into something else then --
SCREAMS!=>Andrea bolts upright in fear, then -- THE LOUD, ECHOING SOUND OF A SLIDE-BOLT CLOSING OVER AND OVER, joins the mayhem -- it’s coming from the closet. Roger can’t stand it -- takes off out of the room -- The SLIDE BOLT NOISE suddenly stops -- along with the FLASHES, casting the room back into darkness. The girls dash out the bedroom door into the hallway just as Roger gets there, both folding into his arms. The CAMERA at the end of the hallway STROBES A FLASH -- the girls scream again, fearful of what they can’t see.
SOON AFTER=>Tight on a section of wood paneling being pried back off the wall with a hammer. Widen -- to see Ed sliding the hammer up and down along a panel’s seam to loosen it. He finally pulls it back off the wall -- Lorraine is the first to see -- -- A SMALL 2’ x 2’ TRAP DOOR framed within another wall that latches from the outside via a SLIDE BOLT -- -- A WOMAN’S VERY OBESE HAND, fingers like sausages, aggressively SLAMS it CLOSED, then SLIDES A LATCH across to lock it. Resume - Lorraine and the others are looking at the trap door. Ed kneels down. Undoes the latch. Slowly opens the door. It’s too dark to see anything beyond.
MOMMY. I’M SORRY MOMMY...=>Lorraine stops -- senses something. She slowly moves the light off the wall and angles it to her forearm -- IT’S COVERED IN GOOSEBUMPS. And for a second, her heart skips a beat -- there’s something else she sees -- -- the light cascading past her forearm down to the floor illuminates BATHSHEBA’S DIRTY, CRUSTED BARE FEET, straddling her own -- from behind. Before Lorraine can turn around -- -- she is aggressively shoved into the wall. The movement jars the flashlight and slinky from her grasp and drops to the floor.
ED=>What do you mean?
LORRAINE=>What’re you doing here?
LORRAINE=>What’re we going to do? ED
AT THE COOP=>Judy opens the coop door. Steps in. She’s surprised to see that there aren’t any chickens outside the hen house, but -- Something in the dirt at her feet catches her attention. She takes a closer look -- -- It’s the SLINKY from the Perron house, half in and out of the dirt. She picks it up. Examines, then puts it in her basket as she heads to the henhouse door.
ERUPTS FROM THE HENHOUSE.=>Lorraine’s body goes tight, then she kicks it into high and races out of the kitchen to the backyard.
LORRAINE=>He’s on the road honey, I’ll tell him when he gets home.
ON THE STAIRS/HALLWAY=>Ed, takes two at a time, speeds to the top, then makes a hard right, heading for the Master bedroom. The door is closed. Ed gets to the door. Opens it. He looks to the bed. Empty. His panicked gaze shifts about the darkness -- Lorraine’s not in there. Ed continues down the hallway to Judy’s room. Door’s closed too. He slowly opens it -- afraid of what he’s going to find.
LORRAINE=>...She was here, Ed.
MAN’S VOICE=>No, I’m sorry -- we don’t expect him to return until this afternoon.
LORRAINE=>-- Who then killed herself...
FATHER O’MALLEY=>Please understand, my hands are tied on this matter -- I feel horrible about this.
FATHER JORDON=>I believe our Lord recognizes faith far more than he does training and education, or politics for that matter. This family doesn’t have a choice, but you do -- and, you have God on your side. If you want to help them, then help them.
ROGER=>Carolyn, let her go -- don’t make me do this, please.
ROGER=>Carolyn, let her go.
ROGER=>You better be right.
ED=>Keep her away --
