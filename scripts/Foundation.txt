TORAN=>Sounds horrific.
TORAN=>Bayta, please--
BAYTA=>WHAT DO WE DO?!
BAYTA=>The Seldon Plan.
COMPUTER=>Good evening, sir.
BAYTA=>He tortures you?
THE VOICE=>Yes! I’ll kill you!
BAYTA=>Hide in my arms.
PRITCHER=>Get us out of here!
PRITCHER=>You’re a lucky man.
MAYOR INDBAR=>Hari Seldon was a great man... but still only a man. There is no need anymore for old myths. The reality around us is proof enough. We made it. We saved the human race from extinction.
MAYOR INDBAR=>I don’t believe that Seldon is going to step out of that vault any more than I think some kind of extraordinary superman is on his way here to destroy mankind.
MAYOR INDBAR=>This is a time for celebration!
BAYTA=>I’ll be right beside you.
MAGNIFICO=>My eyes are closed.
MAGNIFICO=>Where are we going?
PRITCHER=>Not very well. No.
EBLING MIS=>From you, my friend.
EBLING MIS=>Not much for good-byes, is he?
EBLING MIS=>Why do you say that?
EBLING MIS=>You’re a human being.
MAGNIFICO=>Because of the Mule?
EBLING MIS=>Exactly. Very good.
BAYTA=>Hello. I am Hari Seldon.
NERVOUS WOMAN=>It looks just like him.
PRITCHER=>I know. Thank you.
SECTION CHIEF=>All right. Let’s do it.
PRITCHER=>They’ll find you eventually.
MAYOR INDBAR=>No trouble of any kind?
GOVERNOR=>Right back at you.
GOVERNOR=>How did I do, sir?
GOVERNOR=>Oh yes. Very much.
MAYOR INDBAR=>us bearing witness to the culmination of Seldon’s dreams.
HARI SELDON=>Either way it won’t effect the outcome of the plan.
MAGNIFICO=>She was supposed to love me, not you. Not you.
MAGNIFICO=>She will love me. She will!
EBLING MIS=>They may not even know about the Mule or suspect their true purpose in the Plan. They may be waiting for us to find them.
EBLING MIS=>I can see that. Why?
EBLING MIS=>It must not be taken. If it is captured by the Mule prematurely then we are lost.
EBLING MIS=>Finally, I can tell you. The Second Foundation--
MAGNIFICO=>When did you know? A second before you pulled the trigger, I suppose. Well done. I was expecting, if you fired, that you would fire at me. It is not an easy thing to surprise a man of my peculiar talents.
MAGNIFICO=>Allow me to introduce myself.
