J.J. ABRAMS=>It’s more than a movie. It’s an experience, a triumph...
GREG=>“And if he comes?”
JEAN SHELTON=>Painfully unremarkable.
STELLA!!!!=>Don’t ever leave me baby.
TOMMY=>Don’t worry, I pay.
TOMMY=>Bridgitte Brando? GREG
GREG=>How old are you?
TOMMY=>I believe in you.
GREG=>Oh. I thought --
GREG=>“Your own planet?” TOMMY
TOMMY=>What did they say? GREG
GREG=>To this day I’ve never had the guts to sing in public...
TOMMY=>Gimme your pinky. GREG
MRS. SESTERO=>What does he want with you, hmm? Nothing in life is for free Greg.
TOMMY=>Well, we all do...
TOMMY=>Figure of speech.
GREG=>It’s beautiful...
TOMMY=>Ah yes. Here it is!
GREG=>...a one bedroom?
TOMMY=>Check this out...
TOMMY=>You’re the beast. GREG
TOMMY=>Several years now. GREG
GREG=>It’s incredible.
GREG=>Holy shit, we’re doing this! We’re really doing it! Woohoo! TOMMY
GREG=>What do you mean? TOMMY
GREG=>Big star. Tommy -- TOMMY
GREG=>OK, so, first off:
TOMMY=>But you have one.
GREG=>Well yeah, but... TOMMY
GREG=>I... Wow. Really. Yeah I mean... I’m an actor.
WAITRESS=>I’ve seen you there.
TOMMY=>The one and only.
TOMMY=>I let you know how it is, Babyface. Maybe one day you join.
VOICE=>Whenever you’re ready, Tommy.
TOMMY=>I am NOT villain.
AMBER=>Let’s have a drink!
TOMMY=>I am Tommy Wiseau. HAMMER
GREG=>I’m heading out!
TOMMY=>So what do you say?
GREG=>You have money?!
GREG=>Oh you mean now?
GREG=>Tommy, that’s --
PETER=>You’ll notice we have top of the line Arriflex lights...
RAPHAEL=>Wait, shouldn’t we discuss your vision for the movie first?
TOMMY=>The part is Lisa.
TOMMY=>Your Mom just die! JESSIE
MODEL/ACTRESS=>And who’s playing Johnny?
AMBER=>I gotta hand it to Tommy. He’s weird but he comes though.
AMBER=>I’m proud of you.
TOMMY=>Markus, you ready?
TOMMY=>One other thing...
RAPHAEL=>Ready first scene...
“CHRIS-R”=>“Do you have my money?”
TOMMY=>Where is wardrobe?
SAFOWA=>What does that mean?
“JOHNNY”=>“It’s not true. I...” Line!
SANDY=>No, your mark. Where you need to stand. To be in the shot.
GREG=>Um, you know...
GREG=>What do you mean? AMBER
TOMMY=>But I’m director. GREG
TOMMY=>It won’t be good. It will be GREAT.
GREG=>Tommy, can you -
GREG=>Can I talk to you?
GREG=>Wait, seriously?
TOMMY=>Let’s do it again.
RAPHAEL=>Ok then you’re fired. RAPHAEL
TOMMY=>Where is Markus?!
RAPHAEL=>That’s fucking crazy.
RAPHAEL=>So am I fired or not?
GREG=>You mean leave LA? AMBER
“CLAUDETTE”=>“Everything goes wrong at once...”
RAPHAEL=>It’s your fault. You showed up three hours late - again.
TOMMY=>I’m the director.
ROBYN=>I have a theory. It’s autobiographical. Someone in his life was a Denny - kid brother, someone he looked out for or something. Someone else was a Mark, the better looking friend he was always jealous of...
AMBER=>He’s also an actor.
BRYAN CRANSTON=>Well you got that beard...
GREG=>Why wouldn’t he?
“JOHNNY”=>“God... forgive me!”
GREG=>Hey, uh, listen... I know it’s last minute but, um... TOMMY
GREG=>Well, I know tomorrow is the big beard shaving scene -- TOMMY
TOMMY=>Why, are you sick? GREG
“MARK”=>“So... you like it?”
“PETER”=>“I don’t think so.” TOMMY
GREG=>Where’s Rafael?
GREG=>You fired them?!
TOMMY=>Ah forget about them. We don’t need them, we have Todds now.
TOMMY=>San Francisco baby!
GREG=>What, a new scene? TOMMY
TOMMY=>I have new idea!
TOMMY=>Wait till you see. Oh. And I have surprise for you.
HUSBAND.=>The limo pulls up in front. Tommy’s HIRED PHOTOGRAPHERS begin to snap pictures in expectation of Tommy’s exit.
“THE ROOM”=>And out comes Tommy as “Johnny.” Here are his first lines:
“JOHNNY”=>“Wow you look so sexy, Lisa. I would do anything for my girl.”
“THE ROOM”=>“Denny” eats his apple downstairs while, upstairs, “Lisa” and “Johnny” begin their foreplay. A few beats of this and then “Denny,” surprising them both, joins in on the fun! ANGLE ON Amber. She looks at Greg. Wow. He doesn’t return her gaze. BACK ON SCREEN:
“THE ROOM”=>“Johnny” has sex with “Lisa” as only he can. In her belly button. ANGLE ON the Audience. Many now start trading crazy looks like “what the hell are we watching?” Many others fidgeting in their chairs. You can feel it growing. Greg is obviously slinking down in his chair from embarrassment.
“THE ROOM”=>Lisa’s Mom “Claudette” across from “Lisa.”
“LISA”=>“You’re not dying.”
“THE ROOM”=>And the movie’s most famous scene. “Johnny” and “Lisa” having it out.
“LISA”=>“You’re scaring me.” “JOHNNY”
“THE ROOM”=>“Chris-R” threatens to kill “Denny” before “Johnny” and “Mark” show up to rescue him. And then, just as quickly, “Lisa” and “Claudette” are there too.
“THE ROOM”=>“Johnny” and “Mark” on the rooftop. We saw this one being filmed earlier but cut together, it’s even more incredible.
“THE ROOM”=>The big clean shaven reveal. Greg comes through the door.
“MARK”=>“So... you like it?” “JOHNNY”
“PETER”=>“I don’t think so.” TOMMY
TOMMY=>Maybe everyone right, Greg. Maybe it’s true. I am a joke. GREG
“THE ROOM”=>“Johnny” decides to commit suicide. But first he writhes on the ground, humps the RED DRESS, fumbles with the GUN, and, only then, puts it in his mouth and pulls the trigger.
GREG AND TOMMY=>As the audience starts shouting “do it! Do it!” Greg looks at Tommy. He sees a small smile cross his face. And he knows - he’s gotten through to him. They can both enjoy this now.
ANGLE ON SCREEN=>“Johnny” lying there dead - with “Denny” and “Lisa” now also “Mark” again hovering above him - the final FADE OUT is met with STUNNED SILENCE. ANGLE ON GREG AND TOMMY A beat between them. Neither one sure how the audience will react now. And then RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE. Tommy looks at Greg. Takes off his sunglasses. A big smile on his face now. All around him, everyone is standing, cheering, applauding his movie. People seem legitimately enthusiastic about “The Room.” His dream come true - if not exactly as he intended. He nods to Greg. Greg nods back. Friends again. And then, in an instant, he starts jogging up to the front, his arms raised over his head in triumph. The adulation only grows as he’s handed a microphone, heads up to the stage.
ENJOYING “THE ROOM”=>SUPER: “It has since turned a profit.”
OVER BLACK.=>SUPER: “They are best known for “The Room.”
