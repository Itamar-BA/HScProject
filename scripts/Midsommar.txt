GIRLFRIEND=>What did your sister write?
CHRISTIAN=>Well, I just decided today. I wasn’t keeping it from you.
CHRISTIAN=>...What I just said.
JOSH/MARK/PELLE=>Hey!
DANI=>How’s it going?
MARK=>Just chillin’. DANI
JOSH=>So, Sweden...! DANI
DANI=>Psychology. Yeah. That’s how you know I’m nuts.
PELLE=>...and what happened. I can’t even fathom. I mean, I lost my parents, too, so I have some idea, but... Dani looks cornered. TEARS have welled up in her eyes.
DANI=>Oh - thank you.
PELLE=>Four hours, about.
JOSH=>Ha. Ask Pelle.
TWO HOURS LATER=>Pelle is still driving. Everyone is silent and zoning out as the radio plays an old Swedish folk tune. Mark suddenly notices a DEAD BOAR on the side of the road.
DANI=>This is horrible.
INGEMAR=>Holy shit! Pelle!!
INGEMAR=>Simon and Connie, this is Pelle and...all the names I just remembered two seconds ago.
MINUTES LATER=>Dani sits on the grass with Christian and Pelle. Mark is off to the side, stabbing at an ANT COLONY with a stick. Josh paces nearby. His stomach TURNS audibly.
CHRISTIAN=>How are you feeling?
MINUTES LATER=>The group sits on the grass together. The sun is still shining.
PELLE=>Can you feel the energy come up from the earth? CHRISTIAN
JOSH=>Is she mad at us?
CHRISTIAN=>Her family is dead, Mark! Do you get that? They all died!
MOMMY?!... DADDY?!...=>Mommy daddy mommy daddy... CHRISTIAN?!
OF ANTS.=>Dani SCREAMS and RUNS for her life. As she sprints:
CHRISTIAN=>You heard laughing?
PELLE=>How are you, Dani?
HOURS LATER=>CLOSE-UP OF DANI’S SLEEPING FACE. In the distance: a faint, barely discernible melody. It sounds like a flute. A HAND reaches into frame to nudge Dani. She stirs awake.
DANI=>Did it get dark at all?
DANI=>Is it tomorrow?
ODD=>How is the pilgrimage?
ODD=>Hello, hello...yes, hello, welcome. Welcome home!
PELLE=>...I can get an exact translation later.
DANI=>I’m too scared.
PELLE=>“Skin the fool!”
PELLE=>Lumbering, wheat, vegetables... They pass a CIRCLE OF CHILDREN, accompanied by a TEACHER . * They’re carving RUNIC SYMBOLS into smooth, well-sanded STONES.
INGEMAR=>Water power plant.
INGEMAR=>Which is amazing. Yes. Congratulations.
PELLE=>That’s a bear.
JOSH=>Why thirty-two?
DANI=>Oh no. Rickets?
DIFFERENT FLOWERS BEING PICKED.=>INTERTITLE : Nine Flowers Picked (don’t forget
MID-MEAL=>MAJA feverishly carves a small RUNE STONE in her lap. She is hunched over to conceal her progress from curious eyes. The two elderly men are receiving lots of attention. Near Dani, a BLONDE WOMAN cradles the CRYING BABY.
DANI=>Oh, I’m sorry...!
MINUTES LATER=>Everyone has finished eating. Another HUSH falls awkwardly over the procession. Silence, save for the wailing baby. Mark, half-asleep, confusedly looks around. He sees the Pretty Brunette SMILING at him. Caught off guard, he BLUSHES and smiles back . One of the two elderly men STANDS. Clears his throat. Closes his eyes. After a moment, he begins to SING a wordless, choral song. Everyone watches, rapt and emotional. At the appropriate time, the OTHER MAN begins to sing along, softly and awkwardly at first. Soon he rises, singing with greater projection. When the song comes to a finish, SIV stands to RAISE her glass. This prompts everyone else to stand. They all raise their aquavit. A long silence. Siv finally DRINKS. So does everyone else. The MUSICIANS begin to play their handmade instruments, and EIGHT * MIDDLE-AGED MEN break into two groups. They walk to either of the elderly men’s chairs, HOIST them up, and start CARRYING THEM
OFF.=>The congregation follows behind as the elevated men are carried up a hill. Our group JOINS them, confused. Mark lags behind.
SIMON=>What’s okay?! CALL AN AMBULANCE! Everybody’s just watching!
YOUNG BOY=>If She will have it.
CHRISTIAN=>Maybe because we’re anthropologists. Maybe they want someone to document this.
CHRISTIAN=>...How you feeling?
CHRISTIAN=>Well - me neither.
PELLE=>Right! Exactly!
DANI=>You’re a very empathic person, do you know that?
SIMON=>Don’t sort me out, mate!
SIMON=>Go pack our stuff. I’ll pick you up out front in - - what, five minutes? PLUMP ELDER
DANI=>No. We didn’t.
CONNIE=>No. Why would he go without me? He wouldn’t do that.
ODD=>Lunch has been called.
CONNIE=>I’m coming, too.
MINUTES LATER=>Christian sees MARK in the distance. He walks over.
CHRISTIAN=>She went off alone?
JOSH=>Yeah, barely. Never mind. Sorry I brought it up.
MARK=>Uhhh... Oh-kay.
JOSH=>Oh. Yeah. Okay.
LATER=>Breakfast has ended. People leave their tables, carrying their empty plates.
LATER=>Three CIRCLES OF WOMEN have formed around the Maypole. The inside circle is surrounded by the middle circle , which is surrounded by the largest, outside circle . The men, children and older women have gathered on the grass to watch. The LARGE WOMAN stands with musicians . Dani stands in the middle circle. All the neighboring women look very excited. Dani looks down at the earth. At first everything looks normal, but then she notices...GRASS has begun to sprout from her shoes. Dani looks up. Fuck. She’s tripping. The LARGE WOMAN speaks up.
CHRISTIAN=>How do I feel about her how?
CHRISTIAN=>I don’t think I can.
LATER=>Many of the women have now been disqualified. Dani is still in the running! She seems determined to stay alert and compete. The music CEASES. The women STOP. Their attention is turned to a field where NINE SMALL FENCES extend one after the other.
DANI=>Aewobeemeewish!
DANI=>
PLUMP ELDER=>No no - you must try.
MINUTES LATER=>Everyone is finished. Siv RISES. All eyes go respectfully to her.
THRUST.=>Maja looks back at one of the WOMEN . The woman smiles tenderly at her. This would be touching if it weren’t so weird. Maja offers the woman her HAND, and the woman supportively takes it into her hands. The woman lovingly presses her CHEEK against Maja’s open palm, CARESSING her face. EXT. FARMSTEAD - MOMENTS LATER The carriage has returned to the farmstead. Dani steps uneasily out of the wagon, still under the warping influence of the hallucinogen. The SINGING is heard faintly from the Temple.
MAJA=>No. Don’t stop.
PLUMP ELDER=>- and two who have volunteered. Ingemar? Ulf?
PLUMP ELDER=>The honor has been bestowed on Christian Hughes, our ninth and most sacred offering!
SACRED HOUSE...=>INT. SACRED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The interior is completely adorned in greenery. An impossibly lush mausoleum. In the center is a PLATFORM made of hay. Connie’s corpse is rested in one corner. Mark’s is placed in the next corner. Simon’s body is placed in between them. In the following corner is the corpse of one of the ELDERLY MEN who jumped off the cliff. He is surrounded by his most precious belongings . His SON is overseeing the removal of one of his father’s EYEBALLS by the DOCTOR. The doctor has effectively drawn the corpse’s eyeball from its socket. He hands the eyeball to the son. The doctor then moves to the body of the other elderly man who leapt to his death. He is also surrounded by his most prized possessions. The doctor now proceeds to remove his eyeball. EXT. FIELD - DAY The son of the fallen elder has walked to a small HOLE in the earth. He lays his father’s EYEBALL in the hole, and covers it with soil. INT. BOOK-BINDING ROOM - SAME TIME A room that is typically used for book-binding. Its walls are lined with collector’s editions of books. A DEAD BEAR lies on the island table. A deep INCISION has been drawn from the animal’s neck to its groin. Two Hårgan Labourers pull out the bear’s INNARDS. After scooping out the majority of its guts, they pile the waste into a bucket. Then, with the assistance of two well-built Hårgan men, the Labourers endeavor to lift CHRISTIAN’s paralyzed body.
