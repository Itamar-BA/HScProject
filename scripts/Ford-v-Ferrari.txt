AM I ON FIRE?!=>AM I ON GODDAM FIRE!!!!
SAVAGELY VIBRATING IMAGES=>SHELBY, DRIVING in his burnt jumpsuit. He paws at his goggles, wiping residue. Determined. He cranks the wheel of the Aston, downshifts, passing other cars, seeing the holes before they open. All sound begins to fade. Soon, we hear nothing but the whistling of wind and a ticking of a clock.
ACROSS THE PADDOCK=>In wraparound shades, MILES takes the rear wheel off a Mk 1 289 Cobra in race paint. PETER sits on the hood.
MILES=>Don’t get lost..
BRUMOS EXEC=>We heard he’s difficult.
MILES=>Who’s Dieter Voss?
SHELBY=>Do you like losing?
FREY=>What’s he saying?
FERRARI’S VIOLET INK.=>IN THE MARGIN -- A miniature diagram of the Cobra, with its dimensions. Calculations. Also in violet ink. Gozzi re-enters. Enzo glances over. Gozzi makes a tiny signal-
IACOCCA=>Money can buy speed.
IACOCCA=>So it’s challenging.
MILES=>You’re going to build a car to beat old man Ferrari.. SHELBY
MILES=>As in three months? SHELBY
IACOCCA=>Shelby. Do not get on that stage if you don't trust me. SHELBY
MOLLIE=>And the answer is?
MILES=>Yes with Shelby.
MILES=>We’re gonna be OK.
MILES=>This is ridiculous.
LATER.=>The technicians watch as Shelby mechanics finish scotch taping 6 inch lengths of wool yarn all over the hood.
SHELBY=>You look well Roy.
BEEBE=>We built you your own God damned laboratory, Shelby! SHELBY
MILES=>Not unless you do.
SHELBY ENTERS THE OFFICE.=>Before she leaves, the secretary puts the red folder on Ford’s desk, but not before Beebe peeks at it. Shelby watches her close the door.
SHELBY=>Thank you, Mr Ford.
SHELBY=>Yes please Mollie.
SHELBY=>-Apart from that.
PETER=>What are you doing?
REMINGTON=>His brakes have locked.
MOLLIE=>Go inside, Peter.
CHARLIE=>...Brakes would hold longer if we slowed down a bit... MOLLIE
SHELBY=>It's under control.
MILES=>Just hold position.
REMINGTON=>She could come apart.
KITCHEN=>Where he finds Mollie, listening intently to his radio at the kitchen table. He joins her, anxious that Miles is behind. EXT. DAYTONA RACEWAY. DAY.
CHARLIE=>White flag! Last lap!
SHELBY=>Yesterday... we won.
MILES=>Hey.. in bed you.
MILES=>True enough. ..ok.
MONTAGE:=>As the sun rises. Crowds stream through the ticket booth. Families set up picnics along the track. Reports set their typewriters. TV announcers gather their notes. Cameramen set their angles. The score keepers adjust their tiles. EXT. FORD PADDOCK, CIRCUIT DE SARTHE. DAY
IN THE FERRARI BOX.=>Gozzi claps his hand on Enzo’s shoulder. Enzo nods. As below, Bandini roars past, tailed by McLaren and Gurney.
SHELBY AMERICAN PIT. SAME.=>Shelby turns, stands on a crate trying to see. Charlie crouches by a TV monitor at the base of an ABC camera.
IN THE GRANDSTAND. DAY.=>Folks in the stands listen to the Le Mans PA.
IN THE FERRARI BOX.=>Enzo and Gozzi react to news of Scarfiotti’s crash.
SHELBY=>I need a stopwatch.
SHELBY=>What he came to do.
SHELBY=>He ain’t done it yet! He needs another lap for the lead! Use the machine, Bulldog.
SHELBY=>Do not answer that.
IN HIS GT=>Miles closes his eyes a moment. Apotheosis. Top of the mountain. He exhales. Centered within himself. At peace. Spinning through space and time. Beyond the reach of each. From this perfection... Miles eases off the throttle.
MILES=>...could be faster.
CREW MEMBER=>What do you think, Dan?
SHELBY=>I believe he did. PETER
SHELBY=>Okay. You do that.
