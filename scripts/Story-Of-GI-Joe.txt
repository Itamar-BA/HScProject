[A]=>The BIVOUAC in the desert fades in. Dawn is just beginning to break over the distant hills. The chill and half-dark of the night is still on the scene. But now there's a great sense of stir and activity. There is a grinding roar of motors as troop trucks, jeeps and armored cars maneuver about, taking on their loads of men and artillery and uncoiling to form a thin snake of a line that is just beginning to head off across the desert floor to the distant hills to the right. A Sergeant is supervising. Next the view weaving through the movement of the convoy, discloses some of its action: Trucks loaded with men and supplies grind past as they swing into line; a jeep jouncing down the line like a shepherd dog; men on the double-quick run toward trucks that are loading up while still waiting their turn in line. Then we see the TROOP TRUCK as several GI's pile into it and move to the fore. Foremost is Gawky, with a pup still cuddled in his arms. Behind him pile in several other GI's, among them Murphy, Lopez, Mew, Dondaro. As they do so, Lieutenant Walker, a raw-boned, business-like fellow of twenty-six, strides into the scene from the right. Gawky's pup, in its exuberance, lets out a yip. Without breaking his stride Walker scans the truck and heads toward Gawky, the view moving in.
MURPHY=>I'll cut my legs off.
MEW=>Look at 'em scram!
[B]=>The interior of a FARMHOUSE fades in. It is dusk. The old battered farmhouse has been converted into a command post. Lieutenant Strobel, his face strained to the point beyond exhaustion, is at the phone which has been set up on a box. On the wall behind him is a torn field map; Sergeant Fleers near it. Several men lie huddled in sleep in the shadows of the room. Lt. Wilson sits slumped on a box. Dusk is rapidly falling and there is a chill and spiritual darkness about the scene which is sensed more in the weariness of the men's faces, bodies, and dust and sweat-clotted uniforms, than in the failing light. It is that final weariness which men can endure while they still move, talk when they have to, or even fight again when they must. Continuous sound of gun fire is heard throughout.
[C]=>A rocky landscape fades in. There is a long view of the countryside as soldiers are winding over a hill and coming forward. Then we see ERNIE seated at a typewriter in the foreground. As he types, he is seen drinking coffee from a flask and soaking his feet in a helmet filled with water.

DONDARO=>
[D]=>A WINDOW fades in; the sound of the church bell still ringing over the scene. An old, wrinkled woman timidly peers out from behind the battle-scarred, shattered window. She looks uncertainly up and down the street. Evidently reassured, she sticks a small American flag in a corner of the window, a broad smile wrinkling her face. -- Fresh American troops pour across the PIAZZA. Several ambulances of the Surgical Unit drive by. Old Italian villagers with children and bundles trudge back wearily but happily, to their homes. In the foreground -- the engineers have begun to repair the shattered bridge. -- Outside the CITY HALL, a vociferous crowd is angrily milling around the shattered doorway. They drag out a rat-faced civilian from his hiding place. They shower him with blows, cursing: "Fascista Manure Traittore!" as he coweringly runs their outraged gauntlet. Several MP's enter the scene and take the Fascist in tow.
ERNIE=>Oh, yes you would.
MURPH=>
SPENCER=>
[E]=>The ROAD LEADING from the city fades in at dawn. The GI's, led by Walker and Ernie, are slogging on again in the gray dawn. The view moves past several GI's to Warnicki and Mew, then to Murph, gloomily thinking of the brilliant figure he cut on his honeymoon; then to Dondaro tearing up the road, double quick. Beyond him lies the town of San Vittorio. Reaching the line he sneaks in furtively between Spencer and Murph. -- He looks wonderfully relaxed, in sharp contrast to the others. Suddenly he is attracted to something on Murph's back, which we see from DONDARO'S VIEWPOINT: Some company wag has chalked on it, "JUST MARRIED." -- DONDARO grins. Spencer leans over.

SERGEANT=>All right men, fall in.
[F]=>WARNICKI'S DUGOUT fades in. Ernie is sitting alone. Ayrab lies disconsolately at his feet. There's a fire going, coffee bubbling. Suddenly Ayrab leaps up and dashes madly
MOST BEAUTIFUL=>WAR CORRESPONDENTS.
ERNIE=>
ERNIE=>Well, I'll be darned.
[G]=>The HILLSIDE, the MONASTERY in the background, fades in. The stone house is now only a rubble, the shrine cracked. It is raining. In the distance the monastery is dimly seen through the mist. This cuts to WARNICKI'S DUGOUT. The first thing noted is the sound of a radio in this dank, dreary hole. It's a portable and the boys, huddled in everything they own, are gathered around it. The men are listening to the radio.
WALKER=>
LIEUTENANT=>
[H]=>The HILLSIDE fades in as Dondaro is returning in the pitch before dawn, a happy relaxed expression on his face. He furtively steals past Walker's dugout. Walker, shivering, comes out in the bone-chilling morning.

ERNIE=>Where you from, Joe?
