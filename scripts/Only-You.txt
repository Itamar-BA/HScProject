GIRL'S VOICE=>Stop pushing it. You're not supposed to force it. You're supposed to just let it happen.
BOY'S VOICE=>I'm not pushing it, you're pushing it.
GIRL'S VOICE=>I am not.
GIRL'S VOICE=>You're pushing it again.
BOY'S VOICE=>Well, hurry up. My foot's falling asleep.
GIRL'S VOICE=>Mo-mmm. Larry's pushing it.
MOM=>Larry, don't push it.
LARRY=>I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
FAITH=>Wait. I have to write this down.
FAITH=>Grandma told me everybody has a soul mate.
FAITH=>But most people never find theirs, most people settle. I'm never gonna settle.
FAITH=>This way I'll know the name of the man I'm supposed to wait for.
LARRY=>Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
FAITH=>Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
LARRY=>Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
FAITH=>If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that. And stop talking. You're gonna ruin the spell.
LARRY=>Yeah, but... but, Faith, what if he does live here, and one day you just walk past him on the street? I mean, you don't hear his name, you don't get a chance to introduce yourselves. You practically bump straight into each other, but you never even know it?
FAITH=>We'll KNOW.
LARRY=>Okaaaaayyyy.
FAITH=>Damon Bradley. He's the one.
LARRY=>Goodie. Can I ask about the Series now?
LESLIE=>Go on, go on... She wants to know if she's gonna marry Alex.
LESLIE=>But he's got pretty eyes. That means your kids would have pretty eyes. You can always get a car later, but you can't always find pretty eyes. You gotta think ahead.
FAITH=>I think you're all wrong.
LESLIE=>What do you think the most important thing is, Faith?
FAITH=>True love. I believe there's one special person out there who's meant for each of us. And when your eyes meet, it'll be magic and you'll both know it instantly.
FAITH=>Don't you think so, Kate?
KATE=>I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it... Is Larry here?
FAITH=>Yeah. He's around somewhere.
KATE=>They never tell you anything bad. Nobody'd ever go to them if they did.
FORTUNE TELLER=>Who knocked?
KATE=>(pointing at girl She did.
FAITH=>I did.
FORTUNE TELLER=>What's your name?
FAITH=>Faith.
FORTUNE TELLER=>What do you wanna know, Faith?
FAITH=>Um, just basic destiny stuff, I guess. But-- I don't want to hear anything bad. If that's okay.
FORTUNE TELLER=>Spirits.
FORTUNE TELLER=>Harry, I'm outta change.
FORTUNE TELLER=>How come I always wind up next door to the freak show? Just because they're midgets does that mean they don't have to go to the bank like the rest of us?
FORTUNE TELLER=>What?
KATE=>Is that a bowling ball?
BOY'S VOICE=>Hey, Kate. Larry wants you.
LARRY=>I do not.
FORTUNE TELLER=>Something is coming to me. I'm getting... a name.
FORTUNE TELLER=>This name is very important to you... Da-- David. No-- no...
FORTUNE TELLER=>Damon.
FORTUNE TELLER=>His name is... Damon Bradley.
FAITH=>Omigod. Omigod. I have to go.
FORTUNE TELLER=>Just a minute--
FORTUNE TELLER=>Your destiny's two dollars.
FORTUNE TELLER=>Hey--
FORTUNE TELLER=>The truth is, no matter what the cards say, you make your own destiny. Don't wait for it to come to you. You understand?
FAITH=>Can I be excused now?
LESLIE=>I'm just saying I think it would be a good idea.
KATE=>Date police...
LESLIE=>Yes. A guy who says he's gonna call, then doesn't, ought to get slapped with a citation, that's all.
LESLIE=>Anyway, like I said, I've given it a lot of thought and I've finally narrowed it down. A heterosexual with a job.
FAITH=>Well, I don't think it's asking too much to want to feel it in my head and my heart and my body and my soul all at the same time, and to have that feeling to be mutual. Pass the M&Ms please.
LESLIE=>Not as long as you're not hoping to find it on planet Earth.
KATE=>Leslie's right, Faith. You've got to start being more practical. Do you know what the statistics are, the marriage odds for women your age?
FAITH=>I don't believe in statistics.
KATE=>You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
KATE=>What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
FAITH=>No. He smokes.
KATE=>How about the other one? His friend.
FAITH=>Just moved in with his girlfriend.
KATE=>How about that guy at the bank?
FAITH=>Scientologist.
KATE=>Oh.
KATE=>So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I. But we work it out. We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other. I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
FAITH=>Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
LESLIE=>Yeah, I saw that. Like on Let's Make A Deal. You've got the Amana freezer and you can keep it, or risk it on what's behind Door Number Three. Which usually turns out to be a donkey.
FAITH=>I don't have an Amana freezer.
KATE=>It's a metaphor. It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them. And instead wind up with nothing.
FAITH=>Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
KATE=>I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
FAITH=>Hello? Hi, Larry. Yeah, she's here. Hold on. It's your husband.
LARRY=>Kate, you're still there? I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
KATE=>You miss me?...
LARRY=>Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
KATE=>No, why?
LARRY=>Well, there's nothing here to eat.
FAITH=>Is everything okay?
KATE=>Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
FAITH=>But somebody wrote those songs.
KATE=>So, what's your point?
FAITH=>Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
KATE=>No, Faith. They came out of somebody's imagination.
FAITH=>I wish you didn't have to go so early.
KATE=>Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry. And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
LESLIE=>And I told Ted I'd be home later if he wanted to stop by.
FAITH=>I thought you said you thought he had a date.
LESLIE=>Well, after that.
NON-DESCRIPT GUY=>How's it going?
FAITH=>Pretty well, Dwayne. How about you?
DWAYNE=>Can't complain.
FAITH=>No.
KATE=>Is he married?
FAITH=>No.
KATE=>Is he gay?
FAITH=>I don't know. I don't think so.
KATE=>So?...
FAITH=>So, he's not my type. Let me walk you to the elevator.
KATE=>What's he do?
FAITH=>I don't know, Kate.
KATE=>You don't have any idea?
FAITH=>He's a podiatrist or something.
KATE AND LESLIE=>He's a doctor?
FAITH=>Look, there's no chemistry there, okay? There's no... thrill.
KATE=>"Thrills"? That's what you're waiting for? You know how long that lasts? Besides, how do you know? Have you ever been out with him?
FAITH=>No. He's never asked me.
KATE=>Why don't you ask him?
FAITH=>Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
KATE=>If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
LESLIE=>I thought he was kinda cute...
KATE=>Take a chance, Faith... None of us is getting any younger...
ANSWERING MACHINE=>Hi, honey. It's Mom. I just wanted to apologize if I upset you at brunch today.
FAITH=>If you upset me at brunch today?
ANSWERING MACHINE=>For upsetting you at brunch today. Now, you know I don't think you're a failure. And if you never get married, that's perfectly fine with your father and me.
ANSWERING MACHINE=>Of course you're not a freak. You're right, plenty of people aren't married. The guy who cuts my hair isn't married. Hey... maybe you tw-- He's gay. Oh. Never mind. Anyway, if you want to spend the rest of your life alone, well, that's your choice. And I respect it. I just want you to be happy, that's all. Hold on, your Dad wants to say something. Good fruit salad today, Faith. We'll talk to you soon, sweetie.
MONTY HALL=>So, which one is it gonna be, Faith? Will it be... Door Number One?...
MONTY HALL=>Door Number Two?...
MONTY HALL=>Or Door Number Three?...
ALL=>Take Dwayne! Take Dwayne!
FAITH=>Door Number Three?
O.S.=>You need some help?
FAITH=>I do...
O.S.=>Okay, it's settled.
FAITH=>This one, in vanilla. He wants vanilla.
LARRY=>This is the last one before the wedding, right?
KATE=>Right.
LARRY=>And we didn't have to bring another present?
KATE=>No.
DWAYNE=>That's right. Six grand. Can you believe what they get for these things? I'm telling you, it's highway robbery.
DWAYNE=>But she's worth it.
ELDERLY RELATIVE=>We'd almost given up hope, dear.
KATE=>Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
LARRY=>It's not exploitation. These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation? She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
KATE=>Sociologist. And because. Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners. They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
LARRY=>We're all desperate for the money, doll. That's what made this country great. Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
KATE=>Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll.
LARRY=>You used to love it when I called you doll.
KATE=>You said it differently then.
DWAYNE=>...I'm not kidding. All over the metatarsus. Corns the size of your fist-- and this fungus... You know the way tuna fish looks when it's been in the back of the refrigerator for about six months? Anyway--
DWAYNE=>Honey, could you get that? I'm in the middle of a story here--
LESLIE=>Sorry I'm late. I was waiting for a phone call.
KATE=>He begged me to marry him. I didn't even want to marry him.
FAITH=>Yes you did.
KATE=>Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
KATE=>He tricked me. He was really fun back then. And he was so cute... How was I supposed to know that ten years down the road he'd turn out to be an idiot?
DWAYNE=>Hon-ey, picture time.
DWAYNE=>You gonna leave your hair like that?
DWAYNE=>This was really nice.
FAITH=>It was, wasn't it?
DWAYNE=>You did a terrific job, honey.
FAITH=>Thanks.
DWAYNE=>And just think... This is only the beginning.
DWAYNE=>Oh, sweetie, you won't forget to pick up my cleaning tomorrow, will you?
FAITH=>I feel like the Good Witch of the North.
KATE=>Come on, it's not so bad.
FAITH=>Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp.
KATE=>I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
FAITH=>I know... It was.
KATE=>But what?
FAITH=>Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies.
KATE=>That's the problem. When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies. Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap. Turn.
KATE=>But one day you wake up and realize you've been had. Of course life isn't like the movies. That's why there are movies.
FAITH=>Yeah. I guess you're right. I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
KATE=>Let me tell you something about love. There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers. Love is hard work.
FAITH=>I know. You're right.
KATE=>People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive. It's not settling, Faith, it's life. Real life.
FAITH=>I understand, Kate. What do you think of this garter?
KATE=>I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect? Well, guess what?... It isn't. Not for you, not for anybody.
FAITH=>Kate, is something the matter?
KATE=>Larry brought me flowers last night.
FAITH=>Is that bad?...
KATE=>I think he's having an affair.
FAITH=>Okay. Now. Have you talked to him about this?
FAITH=>Have you seen him with someone?
KATE=>No... I can just tell.
FAITH=>After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
FAITH=>Don't move.
FAITH=>Hello?
FAITH=>Hello? Is anybody there?
PHONE=>Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
FAITH=>He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
PHONE=>Who's this?
FAITH=>This is his fiancee. Who's this?
PHONE=>Oh, hi. I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's. I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
FAITH=>I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that. Who should I tell him called?
PHONE=>My name's
FAITH=>I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that?
FAITH=>Damon Bradley...
PHONE=>Right. Thanks a lot. And congratulations. It's not easy finding love these days.
FAITH=>WAIT!! Where are you?
PHONE=>I'm at the airport. Why?
FAITH=>Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
PHONE=>Well, he'd have to hurry. My flight leaves at four o'clock.
FAITH=>Where are you going?
PHONE=>I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
FAITH=>Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...
PHONE=>Huh? Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi. Maybe someday we can all get together.
FAITH=>But wait-- Hello? Hello??
FAITH=>It's a miracle.
KATE=>It's a coincidence.
FAITH=>The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
FAITH=>Okay, okay, but don't you think it's a weird coincidence? Doesn't it seem like somebody's trying to tell me something? And not only that, take a look at this...
KATE=>Taurus: "Today can be a fresh start and a new beginning." Come on Faith, they all say that. In my case it means I'm gonna empty the dishwasher.
FAITH=>I just want to get a look at him, that's all.
FAITH=>Flight 417. Is it still here?
CLERK=>May I see your boarding pass, please?
FAITH=>I-- I must've misplaced it.
CLERK=>I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
FAITH=>I'm sure I've got it here someplace...
CLERK=>Great. Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
FAITH=>You don't understand. The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
CLERK=>Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
CLERK=>Yeah, this is Mario over at Alitalia. We've got a 237 on our hands here. Uh huh. Yeah. Thanks.
CLERK=>It'll be just a moment.
O.S.=>Okay, where's the nut in the dress?
SECURITY GUARD=>Look, ma'am, we agreed not to press charges. But I'm afraid we're gonna have to ask you to leave.
BARTENDER=>Can you drive? Do you want us to call you a cab?
FAITH=>No, thank you. I'm fine.
BARTENDER=>I think we better call you a cab. Where is it you want to go?
KATE=>But you're afraid to fly.
FAITH=>It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
KATE=>But it's July.
FAITH=>It's still the new year...
KATE=>What about your job?
FAITH=>I have vacation time coming to me.
KATE=>You don't have a passport.
FAITH=>That's where you're wrong. I got one nine years ago. I just never had an opportunity to use it.
KATE=>Because you were afraid to fly.
FAITH=>Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor.
KATE=>Does Dwayne know about this?
FAITH=>Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either.
KATE=>How could I tell him? I'm not even speaking to him.
FAITH=>Were you able to find it?
LESLIE=>At the very bottom of Dwayne's closet.
LESLIE=>But... there wasn't a regular yearbook picture of him in there. He must've been absent that day or something.
LESLIE=>However, he was in the marching band.
FAITH=>Thanks, Leslie.
KATE=>I can't believe we did this. Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
FAITH=>Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.
LESLIE=>I think she's right. You shouldn't let a chance like this slip by. What if he's really The One?
KATE=>Les-lie, he's not The One. She's never even met this man. You mean to tell me that you've spent your whole life waiting for somebody with this name-- this name you got from a Parker Brothers game when you were eleven--
FAITH=>No, I haven't. And you forgot about the fortune teller.
KATE=>My God, you have...
FAITH=>Thank you so much.
KATE=>You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
FAITH=>He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying.
KATE=>You don't even know what he looks like. You don't speak the language. You don't know your way around. This is a total stranger, in a foreign land.
KATE=>A foreign land full of millions of Italian men... speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
FAITH=>How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
KATE=>Live happily ever after.
FAITH=>Maybe.
FAITH=>Look, until today, I had forgotten all about this. And chances are I'll find out he's not for me and I'll come home and marry Dwayne and never bring this up again. But what if this is the real thing, Kate? What if this is the real real thing?
FAITH=>Wish me luck.
O.S.=>Will you loan me some clothes?
KATE=>I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
FAITH=>You're coming with me?
KATE=>I'm not saying I think it's a good idea. But if you're going to insist on doing this, I don't think you should go alone. You need to be sensible about it.
FAITH=>You're right. The key is to go about this sensibly. Logically. Rationally.
FAITH=>Did I tell you I figured out we both have the same number of letters in our names?
KATE=>You okay?
FAITH=>Sure. I'm fine. I don't know why I never did this before. I mean, what's the big deal?
FAITH=>Except for the fact that I could lose my job.
FAITH=>I could lose Dwayne.
FAITH=>I'm afraid to fly.
FAITH=>We're here, we're here, we're here! I can't believe we're really here.
FAITH=>You know what?... It seems like there's a lot more available men in Italy.
FAITH=>Now what do we do?
KATE=>The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again?
FAITH=>It's called... the Gritty Palace.
KATE=>"Gritty"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
FAITH=>I don't know... Maybe. Think of it as an adventure.
KATE=>Ow! What the--
KATE=>Cretin.
FAITH=>Oh, look Kate, look how beautiful...
TAXI DRIVER=>Gritti Palace.
FAITH=>This is pretty ni-iice...
KATE=>This is a Lifestyles hotel.
FAITH=>What?
KATE=>"Of the Rich and Famous". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this.
FAITH=>Are you sure?
KATE=>Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
FAITH=>Well, we're here. And more importantly, he's here. We'll cut back on everything else.
FAITH=>Kate. It's one night.
FAITH=>They take credit cards.
FAITH=>We get frequent flyer miles.
FAITH=>I'm so glad I got up the nerve to do this. All my life, I've waited for men to call. Waited for them to ask me out. Waited for them to make the first move. Well, no more of that. I am finally taking charge of my own destiny.
FAITH=>You ask what room he's in, okay?
CONCIERGE=>Buona notte.
KATE=>Hello. Reservation for Faith Corbett, please.
KATE=>And put it on this.
KATE=>And, could you please tell us what room Mr. Bradley is in?
CONCIERGE=>I'm sorry. Mr. Bradley has already checked out.
FAITH=>Excuse me?
CONCIERGE=>Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago. He said his plans had changed unexpectedly. Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
FAITH=>He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
CONCIERGE=>I'm very sorry. Perhaps you misunderstood?
FAITH=>Are you absolutely sure he's gone? Maybe you made a mistake. You must've made a mistake. Could you check again? Please? Sir?
CONCIERGE=>Room 217. Would you like to go up and check under the bed?
FAITH=>Well, which way did he go?
FAITH=>Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
CONCIERGE=>Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
KATE=>Maybe you don't understand. My friend was supposed to meet him here.
FAITH=>Excuse us.
KATE=>Well, he was rude.
FAITH=>I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
KATE=>You gave it your best shot. You tried.
FAITH=>We lost him?...
KATE=>You wait here. I'm gonna go get us a room for the night.
FAITH=>I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
KATE=>You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
FAITH=>Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
KATE=>Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
FAITH=>Did you see him? Do you recognize him?
TOURIST=>Candid Camera, right? Where is it?
KATE=>What are you doing?
FAITH=>He fell out.
FAITH=>Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry, but I think there's something that belongs to me stuck to the bottom of your shoe.
FAITH=>Do you mind if I just--
FAITH=>Oh, I'm sorry...
O.S.=>It wasn't like I did it on purpose.
KATE=>You can't really blame him for being upset. It was an Armani suit.
FAITH=>Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
KATE=>I don't think he understood what you were saying. What's the airport number?
FAITH=>No...
KATE=>I just got a dial tone--
FAITH=>The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
KATE=>So?
FAITH=>So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet. Maybe there's something in there that might help us. Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
KATE=>I am not breaking into anybody's room.
KATE=>So far, I'd say we're looking for a rich slob.
FAITH=>Ah ha!...
KATE=>What'd you find?
FAITH=>A Butterfinger wrapper.
KATE=>A rich, possibly fat, slob.
FAITH=>Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
KATE=>We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
FAITH=>Oh. Right.
FAITH=>This our last hope.
FAITH=>We're saved!
KATE=>What is it?
FAITH=>A phone message. Only--
KATE=>Only what?
FAITH=>Only, it's in Italian...
O.S.=>So what is this? He owes you money?
FAITH=>No... it's just very important that I find him, okay?
CONCIERGE=>Why?
FAITH=>Because.
KATE=>Look, it's very simple. When she was eleven years old, she got this name--
FAITH=>He's my brother.
FAITH=>Yes, my long-lost brother. See, uh, we were separated when we were very young. The last time I saw him we were just babies, but I've recently found out that he's here in Italy. And I'm here trying to find him.
FAITH=>You could say I'm sort of looking for my other half.
KATE=>And she's going to be married in five days, and it would mean so much to her if she could find him before her wedding day.
FAITH=>All I ask is that you just call this number and ask if they know him, if they have any idea where we might find him.
CONCIERGE=>And then you promise you'll go away?
KATE=>Your brother?
FAITH=>What was I gonna do? Tell him the truth?
CONCIERGE=>Ai Monasteri? Va bene.
KATE=>A monastery?
CONCIERGE=>It's a store. In Rome.
CONCIERGE=>Si. Sto cercando Damon Bradley?... Si. Si. Grazie. Ciao.
CONCIERGE=>He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him. Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
FAITH=>So. How do we get to Rome?
KATE=>Couldn't we just have taken a train?
FAITH=>The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
FAITH=>This way we're in control. Besides, look how pretty this is. We're really getting to see the countryside.
FAITH=>I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
KATE=>We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost. Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
FAITH=>Right. So we should've been able to cover more of them.
KATE=>Boy, we sure are seeing the countryside, alright.
KATE=>I'm hungry.
FAITH=>You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
KATE=>What's that supposed to mean?...
FAITH=>Nothing.
FAITH=>I thought all roads were supposed to lead there anyway.
KATE=>I don't know that we should be accepting any rides from strangers.
FAITH=>You expecting somebody you know?
KATE=>Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
FAITH=>Sorry.
KATE=>So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
FAITH=>I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him.
KATE=>You think he misses me at all?
FAITH=>'Course he does.
KATE=>You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to? But maybe I was wrong. Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
FAITH=>Remember in junior high, when I had that Halloween party? And we were playing Twister. And it landed on right-hand-red, and there was only one red spot left. You reached for it, but you started to fall.
FAITH=>And instead of taking it, Larry reached out to catch you. He let you win. Larry never let anybody win. That's when I knew. He was a goner.
KATE=>That was a long time ago.
FAITH=>And you know what I thought then, Kate? I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much. I still hope that.
KATE=>That you'll find someone who'll let you win at Twister?
KATE=>He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day. Did I tell you that?
FAITH=>Larry bought himself cologne?
KATE=>Polo.
LARRY=>So, she just takes off on me. No warning. No explanation. Just this message on the machine, "I'm leaving you. Take the clothes out of the dryer." I mean, what'd I do?
DWAYNE=>I don't get it. She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
LARRY=>She's been acting weird lately, though. I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication". Like I don't know how to communicate.
DWAYNE=>Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.
LARRY=>Exactly.
LARRY=>Who's dying?
DWAYNE=>Your great aunt.
LARRY=>What great aunt?
KATE=>You really think this is safe?
FAITH=>I'd say so...
KATE=>God, the Catholic Church is even richer than I thought.
SISTER MARGHERITA=>Ai Monasteri.
O.S.=>Do you believe in love at first sight?
FAITH=>Yes.
KATE=>I'm married.
YOUNG ITALIAN STUD=>I know, I saw your ring. This is no problem. I only want for us to be friends.
YOUNG ITALIAN STUD=>I am Giovanni.
GIOVANNI=>And you are?...
KATE=>Kate.
GIOVANNI=>You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
KATE=>No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later.
GIOVANNI=>This is your most lucky day. My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
GIOVANNI=>I wait here for you.
FAITH=>Hello. Uh, do you speak English?
WOMAN BEHIND COUNTER=>A little.
FAITH=>Thank God. I'm looking for Anna?
WOMAN BEHIND COUNTER=>I am Anna.
FAITH=>Anna, I'm Faith. You don't know how happy I am to meet you. You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
KATE=>Her brother.
FAITH=>Right. My brother.
ANNA=>Your brother. Fratello tuo.
FAITH=>Yes. Right. Si. My fratello. And, I was thinking that maybe someone here, well, you, might know him. His name is Damon Bradley?...
ANNA=>Damon Bradley.
FAITH=>Yes. You do know him?
ANNA=>E' un porco!
FAITH=>Excuse me?
KATE=>What did you say to her?
FAITH=>I don't know. I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
KATE=>What's she saying?
KATE=>Oh. Wait a minute--
KATE=>Hey, Giovanni...
KATE=>My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is. Can you tell us what she's saying?
GIOVANNI=>She's saying he's a-- a-- porco.
KATE=>A porco?
GIOVANNI=>A pig! A pig! She's saying he's a pig.
GIOVANNI=>A very large pig.
FAITH=>Ask her if she knows where he is?
GIOVANNI=>Sa dov'e' lui?
GIOVANNI=>No.
FAITH=>Ask her if she knows how I might reach him? If she has a telephone number?
GIOVANNI=>Ha un numero di telefono?
GIOVANNI=>She did, but she...
GIOVANNI=>...misplaced it.
GIOVANNI=>He thinks she's going to meet him at Mezzaluna tonight, but she--
ANNA=>HAH!
GIOVANNI=>...has a prior commitment.
FAITH=>What's mezzaluna?
GIOVANNI=>A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.
FAITH=>That's it. That's it. That's all I need to know. Bless you, thank you, thank you.
ANNA=>Sorry.
PROPRIETOR=>Cosi va bene.
ANNA=>I'm sorry your brother is a pig!
KATE=>Who is it I pay for these?
FAITH=>All that proves is that she wasn't the woman who was meant for him.
FAITH=>And now we know where he's gonna be.
GIOVANNI=>I must leave town for two days. Was unavoidable. But, day after tomorrow, I return...
GIOVANNI=>Forty-eight hours...
FAITH=>All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous. God, I hate blind dates. Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
KATE=>You're right. At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself. Smile.
FAITH=>Let's get a drink.
KATE=>Aren't you going to ask the maitre'd if he's here?
FAITH=>I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
KATE=>You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
KATE=>He's a god.
ADONIS=>Excuse me, I hope you don't think I'm being too forward. I'm here waiting for a friend, but I couldn't help noticing the two of you.
KATE=>We noticed you, too.
ADONIS=>I was wondering if you might be persuaded to join me--
KATE=>We'd love to.
ADONIS=>Great. I'm Guiseppe Romano.
KATE=>So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him.
FAITH=>I told you. If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy. I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
KATE=>Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
FAITH=>Because I'm the one who's single.
KATE=>I never even got to be single.
FAITH=>Sure you did.
KATE=>Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
FAITH=>Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here?
KATE=>He's heeeeeerrre...
FAITH=>Oh my God. Where?
KATE=>He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us. He's wearing a navy jacket. If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
FAITH=>Is he looking at us?
KATE=>Nope.
FAITH=>Oooooo, I can see his sleeve...
FAITH=>I guess I should just go over and introduce myself, huh?
FAITH=>Who do I say I am?
FAITH=>Right, right... Okay.. You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
KATE=>Faith. So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe. At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
FAITH=>Right. Okay... It's meant to be right? This is it.
KATE=>Faith--
FAITH=>What?
KATE=>Good luck.
KATE=>I found one.
KATE=>Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
FAITH=>Okay, here's what I think. We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
KATE=>And then what, Faith?
FAITH=>And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
FAITH=>What?... My hair?
O.S.=>I like the style. I just don't think this color works for me.
FAITH=>Oh. Thank you.
DAMON=>Allow me.
FAITH=>Thanks very much. So what do you think?
KATE=>That was really sweet...
FAITH=>I meant about my idea.
KATE=>I think it's time we got some professional help.
FAITH=>Like a detective.
KATE=>No... Like a psychiatrist.
FAITH=>Don't be silly. How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
FAITH=>Thank you.
FAITH=>I'm gonna go see what I can find out about speaker rental.
FAITH=>Excuse me.
DAMON=>So, what's the story with your friend?
KATE=>My friend has lost her fucking mind...
DAMON=>What's she doing?
KATE=>She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
DAMON=>What for?
KATE=>So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
DAMON=>No, really. What's she doing?
KATE=>Really. She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
DAMON=>Seriously.
DAMON=>Oh. Well, what's wrong with that?
DAMON=>Only... if she's never met this guy, what makes her think he's perfect for her?
DAMON=>Were they pen pals?
KATE=>No.
DAMON=>Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
KATE=>No.
DAMON=>Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
KATE=>She got his name off a Ouija board when she was eleven.
DAMON=>What is his name?...
FAITH=>He said it would take at least six months to get a permit for a loudspeaker. And, you have to get the Pope to approve it.
FAITH=>Let's just go.
DAMON=>Will you be staying in Rome long?
DAMON=>Your friend said you were looking for someone? Maybe I can help you track him down. I speak a little Italian. And I have a friend who works at the embassy. Maybe we could--
FAITH=>Thank you, but I really don't want any help.
DAMON=>What's his name? I'll look into it for you. I could give you a call.
FAITH=>Look, I appreciate the offer, but--
DAMON=>Just tell me his name...
FAITH=>Damon Bradley.
DAMON=>But, that's-- I'm Damon Bradley...
FAITH=>You're...
FRANCESCA=>And you're the biggest mess I've ever seen.
FRANCESCA=>I find that very attractive.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>...Coming so close and yet just missing each other. Do you know what I mean?
DAMON'S MOTHER=>There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that. About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them. And the last line of it goes, "Who knows? Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
FAITH=>--separate, in the evening..."
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Yes.
FAITH=>My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Your hair... is perfect.
FAITH=>You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
FRANCESCA=>Oh no. Do you?
FAITH=>No.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>But... just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
FAITH=>Okay. Good idea. You first.
FRANCESCA=>Me first? Alright, well, Something embarrassing, right? Something we don't want to admit in public.
FRANCESCA=>I'm a liberal.
FAITH=>I'm a liberal!
FRANCESCA=>No...
FAITH=>My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
FRANCESCA=>Well, as long we both know we're going into this with our eyes wide open...
FAITH=>You're right. This is a really pretty view.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Not this.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>This...
KATE=>So, you're saying you think I should call him.
BARTENDER=>He is your husband, no?
KATE=>Yes, but... He was having an affair.
BARTENDER=>Si.
KATE=>The point is, he was sleeping with another woman.
BARTENDER=>Uh huh.
KATE=>They were having sex.
BARTENDER=>She was your sister.
KATE=>No, she wasn't my sister.
BARTENDER=>Your mother.
KATE=>Of course not.
BARTENDER=>Your grandmother?
KATE=>Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
KATE=>So, how much longer 'til Giovanni gets back?
DAMON'S MOTHER=>I think I'll have it bronzed.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>What?...
FAITH=>I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember. With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun... And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
FAITH=>There is one other thing you should know about me.
FRANCESCA=>Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
FAITH=>I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days.
FRANCESCA=>Except possibly that.
FAITH=>And, he's a friend of yours. It's Dwayne.
FRANCESCA=>Dwayne?
FAITH=>Dwayne Pinsley. From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Oh, right. Dwayne. You're engaged to Dwayne?
FAITH=>It just happened. I didn't plan it. I was alone. And he was... there. But now everything's changed. I owe it to him to let him know. I need to tell him.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>You're sure...
FAITH=>I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Good.
FAITH=>Let's find a telephone.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
FAITH=>Okay.
FAITH=>Don't be afraid. You can tell me.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>You're sure...
FAITH=>We found each other, didn't we?
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Yes. We did.
FAITH=>It's alright... this is our destiny.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Okay. Okay, the thing is... I'm not exactly... I mean-- only in the most literal sense-- I'm not Damon Bradley.
FAITH=>What?
DAMON'S MOTHER=>My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
FAITH=>What is it?
PETER=>It's Peter Wright.
PETER=>Boy, am I glad that's over with.
PETER=>I had a feeling this was gonna be a problem. You're upset, right?
PETER=>Everything else is true. I swear. I am a liberal. I do live in Boston. I am a zoologist. I did see "Local Hero" fifteen times. I am single. I don't believe in Scientology and I don't smoke. But, okay, I admit it, mea culpa, I lied about one little thing.
FAITH=>One little thing? You call your identity one little thing?
PETER=>You've never lied?
FAITH=>That's not the point.
PETER=>You said whatever it was you would understand.
FAITH=>That was before I found out what it was.
PETER=>You're leaving?
PETER=>Wait-- Let's put this in perspective. You're going to let a few little letters keep us apart?
PETER=>Look, if the name's that much of a problem, why don't you just call me that? It'll be my nickname.
FAITH=>How could you do this to me?
PETER=>I'm in love with you.
FAITH=>Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that?
KATE=>Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
FAITH=>But how could he know? He only just met me.
KATE=>Men have ways.
KATE=>What a drag. You finally meet the man of your dreams and he turns out to be a pathological liar.
PETER=>Still busy? Okay, can I leave another message, please? Alright, the message is, would she rather have the wrong guy with the right name or the right guy with the wrong name? No-- no, no. They alternate, see? It's the wrong guy--
PETER=>I have to talk to her.
KATE=>She's not here.
PETER=>Where is she?
KATE=>She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
PETER=>No! That's not fair. That's not it at all. Look, something somewhere got screwed up. Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed. I may not have the right name, but I was there. I'm the guy. I'm-- skywriting??
KATE=>You didn't think this would be a problem?
PETER=>It was an emergency. I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her. I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
KATE=>Good strategy.
PETER=>Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome? My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles. The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three? So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either. I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out. So I was wandering around. Just wandering... When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
PETER=>And then I saw her. And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light. And life and passion and yearning. And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
KATE=>Mania.
PETER=>Whatever. And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever. And He did. She told me the name. Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
PETER=>And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
KATE=>That's really romantic.
KATE=>Too bad she hates your guts.
PETER=>It's just a name for chrissakes. The whole thing is so ludicrous. For all she knows, this guy could be the biggest loser on the face of the planet. He could have a criminal record. He could think Ronald Reagan was a great president.
PETER=>I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
KATE=>Ten billion to one.
GIOVANNI=>Guess who-oooo...
GIOVANNI=>Oh.
KATE=>Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
GIOVANNI=>Oh, hello. I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
KATE=>I'd love to.
PETER=>Please. You've got to help me.
KATE=>I'll see what I can do.
FAITH=>Are you sure people are gonna be able to read this?...
KATE=>Don't you have to be getting back to work?
GIOVANNI=>It's siesta.
KATE=>Oh.
GIOVANNI=>You see, in America they care for work, they live to work. But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
KATE=>How old are you?
GIOVANNI=>What do the years matter? I've known you for centuries...
KATE=>Hi-iii...
FAITH=>Hi. Where've you been?
KATE=>Sightseeing... What're you doing?
FAITH=>Packing.
KATE=>Why?
FAITH=>Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
KATE=>So, you've had a little bad luck.
FAITH=>A little bad luck?
KATE=>Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up.
FAITH=>Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place? Children are very impressionable, you know.
KATE=>So you're just quitting? Just like that?
FAITH=>I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
KATE=>I know, but...
FAITH=>It was a ouija board, remember?
KATE=>...and a fortune teller.
FAITH=>Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be. I've got forty-eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
KATE=>What about Peter?...
FAITH=>Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter.
FAITH=>The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind. May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
KATE=>Who said I was going?
FAITH=>What?
KATE=>I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
GIOVANNI=>You ready, Kate? Oh, hi, Faith. Did you do something different to your hair?
KATE=>He promised to take me on a tour of the fountains... But I don't have to go.
FAITH=>No. No, you go ahead.
KATE=>You sure you'll be okay?
FAITH=>I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend.
KATE=>I'll be back before you leave.
FAITH=>Long distance operator, please.
PHONE MACHINE=>"Hi, it's Dwayne. Don't be a heel, leave a message."
DAMON=>Hi, Dwayne. It's me. I'm just calling to say I'm on my way home.
FAITH=>The situation here is looking pretty hopeless. I guess she's given up. So, it's Flight number 966. It gets in at one tomorrow. I'll see you then.
O.S.=>Kate told me you were going home. Is that true?
PETER=>Is it?
PETER=>You're limping.
FAITH=>I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe.
PETER=>Are you okay? You want some help?
FAITH=>NO.
PETER=>You are leaving, aren't you?
PETER=>Why can't you just tell me?
FAITH=>If it's any of your business, yes.
PETER=>Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
FAITH=>Yes.
PETER=>To the foot doctor.
FAITH=>Yes.
PETER=>Why?
FAITH=>Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
PETER=>He's safe.
FAITH=>So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
PETER=>Does he love you?
FAITH=>He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
PETER=>You didn't answer my question.
FAITH=>Why are you asking me this?
PETER=>Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way. Does he know who you are?
PETER=>You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
FAITH=>What?
PETER=>He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
PETER=>There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?... Just tell me what it is, I'll say it. I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
FAITH=>Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
PETER=>So?
FAITH=>So it wasn't real.
PETER=>What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
FAITH=>No, that wasn't a lie. That was... a mirage.
FAITH=>Don't you see?.. We're not the ones who are meant to be. You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
PETER=>Because I don't have the right name?!
FAITH=>I'm going home. I never should've come here in the first place and I'm going home.
PETER=>Fine. Okay. Forget me. Leave me out of it. But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
FAITH=>Who says I don't love him?...
PETER=>I see. Well then, go home. Get married. I hope you'll be very happy.
PETER=>You can't go.
FAITH=>Why not?
PETER=>Because. I know where he is.
PETER=>I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel. So, I called there, they said he left yesterday. But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route. He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano. I called. And they told me he's checked in.
FAITH=>Where's Positano?
PETER=>It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...
FAITH=>Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
PETER=>Look, I know there's no going back for us. That's not it. I just want to make this up to you. Clear my relationship karma. And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there. Please. Let me do this for you. Let this be my gift to you.
FAITH=>Why?
PETER=>Because-- I want you to be happy.
DAMON=>Dwayne, you're still not there?... I was really hoping we could talk.
KATE=>Peter found him?
FAITH=>Yes. Isn't that amazing?
KATE=>Amazing...
FAITH=>He's down in someplace called Positano. Peter says we can make it there by morning.
PETER=>He's travelling with his mother...
PETER=>The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
FAITH=>He likes to read... Did he mention anyone in particular?
PETER=>Uh, I'd rather not say.
FAITH=>Tell me.
PETER=>I'd really rather not say.
FAITH=>Please. I need to know.
PETER=>Mickey Spillane.
FAITH=>Mickey Spillane?
PETER=>Or Hustler.
KATE=>Joan Collins stayed here.
FAITH=>Is Damon Bradley here?
CONCIERGE=>Si. A la piscina.
PETER=>He's out by the pool right now.
FAITH=>Right now?
PETER=>Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother.
KATE=>That's him?!
KATE=>That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
PETER=>Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
FAITH=>Of course.
PETER=>Do you want me to do it?
FAITH=>NO.
FAITH=>Hi...
FAITH=>Uh-hem, excuse me, hello...
MAN AT POOL=>You're in my sun.
FAITH=>Oh. Sorry.
FAITH=>Pardon me, but...
MAN AT POOL=>What?
FAITH=>Do you have the time?
MAN AT POOL=>Do I look like I'm wearing a watch?
FAITH=>No, I guess not. I just thought maybe--
O.S.=>Hey, Damon.
HIM=>Yeah?
LITTLE KID=>Thanks for letting me borrow this.
HIM=>No problem.
FAITH=>You're Damon Bradley?
HIM=>Uh huh.
FAITH=>Excuse me.
KATE=>Whatareyoudoing?!
FAITH=>What if he doesn't like me?
KATE=>It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
FAITH=>My God... you're right.
KATE=>Faith, I'm kidding. Is this how you plan to get what you want from life? When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
PETER=>Hey, if she doesn't wanna meet him, she doesn't wanna meet him.
KATE=>You have overcome everything it took to get here. Every obstacle to reach this moment. This fateful moment. Now, it's in your hands.
KATE=>Is that what you want?
KATE=>Then go get it.
O.S.=>Hi again...
HIM=>Hello.
FAITH=>Beautiful place...
HIM=>Sure is.
FAITH=>Been here long?
HIM=>Just since yesterday.
FAITH=>I just got here, too. Not yesterday. But, just now. Today. Just a few minutes ago. Yeah, we just got here... I mean, I just got here. I'm single.
FAITH=>Well, I'll probably be seeing you around, then.
HIM=>I hope so.
FAITH=>I was wondering... Do you have dinner plans?
HIM=>Tonight?
FAITH=>Any night.
HIM=>Well, not exactly...
FAITH=>Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
HIM=>Sure.
FAITH=>You would? Really?
FAITH=>Okay. Okay, how about I meet you at the restaurant at the base of the stairs at, say, 8:30?
HIM=>I'll look forward to it.
FAITH=>Okay. Good. See you then, then.
HIM=>Wait.
FAITH=>Yes?
HIM=>Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
FAITH=>Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.
HIM=>It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
FAITH=>Did you see his eyes? I've never seen eyes that green. And he was so nice. Did you see how nice he was? He was really nice.
KATE=>I thought you were meeting him there?
FAITH=>That's what I thought.
KATE=>Oh, it's you. It's only Peter.
PETER=>Thanks.
KATE=>Sorry...
FAITH=>Hi, Peter.
PETER=>Hi.
FAITH=>Come on in.
PETER=>So. You found him.
FAITH=>You found him. I don't know how to thank you.
PETER=>Well, it looks like we both lucked out. I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
FAITH=>Oh. That's nice.
PETER=>Yeah.
PETER=>And she's a knock-out, too.
FAITH=>Well, good. Good for you.
PETER=>Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
PETER=>So, you're going to dinner?
PETER=>Where are you going? Just-- out of curiosity...
FAITH=>Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs. Nothing fancy.
PETER=>Oh, thanks. Well, have a good time.
FAITH=>You too.
PETER=>Hey--
FAITH=>What?
PETER=>Nice dress.
FAITH=>Thank you, Peter. Thank you so much.
HIM=>You look like a goddess.
HIM=>Wine?
FAITH=>Sure.
HIM=>Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
HIM=>You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke. I could sense the chemistry between us.
FAITH=>Really?
HIM=>Really...
FAITH=>Well, to-- new friends.
HIM=>And more...
FAITH=>So, I guess you're probably wondering why I asked you to dinner...
HIM=>Not really. Happens to me all the time.
HIM=>Well, fuck me.
FAITH=>Excuse me?
HIM=>Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
FAITH=>Don't worry about it. You're my guest.
FAITH=>What looks good?
HIM=>Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
FAITH=>You like shrimp? I like shrimp.
PETER=>What?...
FAITH=>What are you doing here?
PETER=>We were hungry.
HIM=>So what do you think?
FAITH=>Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
O.S.=>Damon. There you are.
HIM=>I didn't think you'd mind...
HIM=>Faith, this is my mother.
FAITH=>Oh, hello.
HIM=>Mommy, this is Faith.
FAITH=>Nice to meet you, Mrs. Bradley.
PETER=>"Mommy"?
FAITH=>So, you say you've been to Italy before?
HIM=>A few times. It's kind of an annual tradi--
PETER=>Pardon me, but could we borrow your salt?
HIM=>Sure.
FAITH=>You were saying...
PETER=>Boy, that looks tasty. What is that?
HIM=>Scampi.
DAMON'S MOTHER=>Damon. Not with your mouth full.
PETER=>Scampi, huh? I love scampi. I practically always get it in these seafood places. Is that good scampi?
HIM=>You want to try some?
PETER=>Sure. I'll trade you some of my pasta.
HIM=>El checko, por favor.
PETER=>Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
FAITH=>I don't know if that's such a--
DAMON AND HIS MOTHER=>Great idea!
FAITH=>Why are you doing this?
PETER=>I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember?
FAITH=>So were you.
PETER=>Exactly. Besides, no hard feelings. You found somebody. I found somebody. I thought we could double.
GIOVANNI=>This is back when I was in school, you take those tests, you know? They said I should go into physical therapy. Or wood-working.
GIOVANNI=>I'm good with my hands.
KATE=>Hold that thought.
KATE=>Hello?
FAITH=>Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help.
KATE=>Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
FAITH=>It's still a little too early to say...
HIM=>Irregardless of the politics. It's time we stopped dicking around. I'm telling you, nuculear is the only way out.
PETER=>But don't you think that's a little short-sighted?
KATE=>Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
FAITH=>No one's perfect, Kate.
KATE=>And he is living proof.
FAITH=>No, I think maybe you've been right. I think I may have been too critical in the past.
KATE=>Faith, if I may say so, you picked a helluva time to come to this realization.
HIM=>Human rights, shmuman rights.
FAITH=>Maybe I can change him.
KATE=>I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
FAITH=>Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
KATE=>Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
FAITH=>Well, what about books? You like Hemingway? You gotta love Hemingway.
PETER=>The Sun Also Rises. For Whom the Bell Tolls. The Old Man and the--
HIM=>He's alright. For a closet homo.
FAITH=>How about music? You like classical?
PETER=>The Boston Pops. Season tickets.
FAITH=>Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
PETER=>Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
HIM=>Audrey was cool.
HIM=>Too bad she didn't have any tits.
KATE=>Baseball. Carmelcorn. Organized religion. Sting. Grape-flavored candy. The Marx Brothers. Long foreplay. Gardening. Drum solos. Dogs. Mai tais.
KATE=>Amazing. With the exception of fruitcake, which, let's be honest, everybody hates, you two have absolutely nothing whatsoever in common. That's got to be almost statistically impossible.
FAITH=>What's he doing now?
KATE=>He's tearing the wings off a moth and making it walk around.
HIM=>So, what are we waiting for?
FAITH=>What?
HIM=>Let's face it. You want me.
FAITH=>He's a jerk.
KATE=>Yes. He is.
FAITH=>I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
KATE=>Yup.
FAITH=>I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
KATE=>When you could've found one in America.
FRANCESCA=>Do not feel bad. He was scum.
HIM=>You didn't think that last bit with the bugs was a little over the top?
PETER=>Not at all. You were perfect.
PETER=>And thank Mrs. Walker, too.
PETER=>You okay?
FAITH=>Yeah.
PETER=>I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
PETER=>I'm sorry.
FAITH=>I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
PETER=>Why should you be embarrassed? He was the jerk.
FAITH=>In spite of the way it all turned out, though, I want you to know how much I appreciate your helping me find him. I would always have wondered what might have been.
PETER=>Yeah. Well, was the least I could do.
FAITH=>No, it was more than that. It was very generous of you. It was very kind.
PETER=>I better go.
FAITH=>Sure. I understand.
PETER=>Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
FAITH=>No. Course not.
KATE=>So...
FAITH=>So. I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
KATE=>Giovanni, I want to thank you.
GIOVANNI=>I thank you.
KATE=>No, you don't understand. It's been wonderful meeting you. But... I have a husband. I have two kids at camp. I have a life I have to go back to.
GIOVANNI=>You don't have to go if you don't want to...
KATE=>But I do want to.
GIOVANNI=>You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas. The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way. Who prey on unhappily married women. Who lure unsuspecting--
KATE=>Giovanni.
GIOVANNI=>Huh?
KATE=>That's exactly what you are.
GIOVANNI=>Is it that obvious?
KATE=>Thank you for making me feel wanted.
GIOVANNI=>Kate.
GIOVANNI=>It was my pleasure.
O.S.=>Do you believe in love at first sight?...
FAITH=>Kate is that you?
KATE=>Uh huh.
FAITH=>I didn't expect you back so soon.
KATE=>Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
FAITH=>Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding.
KATE=>Oh.
KATE=>Well... I ought to be getting home anyway. The kids'll be back from camp soon. The house is probably a mess.
FAITH=>And Larry?...
KATE=>What about Larry?
FAITH=>I don't know. I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation. Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
KATE=>Maybe...
PETER=>Hi.
FAITH=>Hi. Are you... busy?
PETER=>No. Are you're leaving?
FAITH=>No. I just came by to apologize.
FAITH=>It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy. Like I was on drugs or something.
PETER=>I know the feeling.
FAITH=>Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
PETER=>You aren't?
FAITH=>No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
PETER=>Well. Congratulations.
FAITH=>Thank you. So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime. I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
PETER=>Are you asking me out?
FAITH=>Yes. I am.
PETER=>In that case... no...
PETER=>I don't have other plans.
KATE=>What's this?
CONCIERGE=>From an admirer...
PETER=>You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
FAITH=>I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
PETER=>Okay. I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
PETER=>Hurry...
PETER=>Is something the matter?
FAITH=>GET OUT!!
PETER=>I'd call that a yes. Do I get a hint?
FAITH=>You want a hint? I'll give you a hint. You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
PETER=>There's no such thing.
FAITH=>What?
PETER=>Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
FAITH=>Who cares?! You hired an actor??
PETER=>I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
FAITH=>No one had to tell me. He's starring in the local play.
FAITH=>You did, didn't you? You got somebody to pretend to be him? Tell me the truth. For once.
PETER=>Alright. The truth is... I thought we had something here.
FAITH=>I can't believe you did that!
PETER=>And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
FAITH=>You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
PETER=>I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?
FAITH=>Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
PETER=>As I recall, you were on your way home. And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
FAITH=>A "little white lie"? A "little white lie"?
PETER=>What would you call it?
FAITH=>I would call it-- unforgivable.
PETER=>Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here? We're talking about love, okay? Let's be rational.
FAITH=>Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
PETER=>Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy. No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you. Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up? How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
FAITH=>Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
PETER=>Very funny.
FAITH=>No, it isn't. I called off my wedding all because of you.
PETER=>Really?...
FAITH=>Yes.
PETER=>And this is the thanks I get. I did you a favor. You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
FAITH=>That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to?
PETER=>If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
PETER=>Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real. Granted, ideally, me. I didn't do it to hurt you. I did it for you. I did it for us...
FAITH=>There is no us.
PETER=>Oh, that's right. There's only him. Mr. Perfect Imaginary Man. You know, I gave you more credit than you deserved. The truth is, you're in love with the fantasy. You're afraid of something real.
LARRY=>Are you kidding? All that stuff was for you, Kate. It just seemed like you were mad at me, so I thought maybe if I-- I hate Polo...
LARRY=>There's just one thing I still don't understand.
LARRY=>I don't have a great aunt in Italy.
FAITH=>You...
LEONARD=>Hi there...
FAITH=>Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
LEONARD=>It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it? I knew that was too much.
FAITH=>No, you gave a very convincing performance. And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
LEONARD=>My picture's up?
FAITH=>Congratulations.
LEONARD=>Thanks.
FAITH=>So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts?
LEONARD=>I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
LEONARD=>That's a shame.
FAITH=>Yeah, well... Anyway, I'm here to pick up my ticket. TWA, Flight
LEONARD=>Is this your first trip here?
LEONARD=>It's an amazing place, don't you think?
FAITH=>Amazing.
LEONARD=>Smoking or non-smoking?
FAITH=>Non. Please.
LEONARD=>Lots of history. For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
FAITH=>Hm.
LEONARD=>Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing. Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know. An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
LEONARD=>Well. Have a good trip.
LARRY=>Damon Bradley? That's why you're here?
KATE=>What? You know him?
LARRY=>It was just a joke. I was pushing the arrow. I wanted to get to the next question. I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
KATE=>Are you saying you just made the whole thing up? The guy never even existed?
LARRY=>He existed. He was some kid I knew from Little League. He was a real jerk. You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
KATE=>Went to high school with him. But...
KATE=>what about the fortune teller?
LARRY=>I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
LARRY=>It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
KATE=>Larry, you've got to tell her.
LARRY=>I can't tell her. She's called off her wedding. She'll never speak to me again.
LARRY=>You tell her.
FAITH=>Larry! What are you doing here? Mom sent you.
LARRY=>No.
LARRY=>I came after the woman I love.
KATE=>He missed me.
LARRY=>The two women I love. How are you, Faith?
FAITH=>I'm fine. Have you seen Peter?
KATE=>He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.
FAITH=>Larry, did you rent a car?
LARRY=>Yeah--
KATE=>Faith. Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
KATE=>I'll leave you two alone.
FAITH=>Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
LARRY=>Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
FAITH=>Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is. I know where to find him.
LARRY=>But, Faith--
FAITH=>Please, Larry. I have to hurry.
FAITH=>I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
LARRY=>But Faith--
FAITH=>What?...
LARRY=>It's the red Fiat.
KATE=>She what?!
LARRY=>She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
KATE=>And you didn't tell her?
LARRY=>She didn't give me a chance.
LARRY=>Well, you never know... Maybe they'll hit it off...
LARRY=>What do you mean we have to stop her before she does something crazy?
FAITH=>Boarding pass.
CLERK=>I'm afraid you're too late, m'am.
CLERK=>And this isn't for this airline, either.
O.S.=>A heart transplant?!
FAITH=>That's right. She's been waiting a long time.
FAITH=>I'm afraid I can't let you do that. Hearts are very fragile.
CARABINIERE=>Who are you?
FAITH=>I'm the cardiologist.
CLERK=>You didn't have that with you before. Prima non l'aveva con se.
FAITH=>It was late in arriving. But it's here now.
CARABINIERE=>Do you have any I.D.?
FAITH=>Look, I've given you my credit card, my passport number. I've paid for the flight. Now, while you two sit here cross-examining me, someone's future is hanging in the balance.
FAITH=>It's a heart, for godssakes. You guys are Italian. Don't you get it? It's the greatest gift one human being can give another. Are you telling me you're going to stand there and deny her the chance of a lifetime?
ONLOOKER=>Let the nut go...
PILOT=>Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm afraid we've got a temporary delay. We have a medical emergency and are going to have to head back to the gate.
LOUDSPEAKER=>Damon Bradley. Signore Damon Bradley. E pregato di recarsi all'ufficio informazione.
LOUDSPEAKER=>Damon Bradley. Mr. Damon Bradley, please meet your party at the information booth.
O.S.=>Larry Corbett?
STRANGER=>I thought that was you. Damon Bradley. Remember me?
DAMON BRADLEY=>Honey... This is my wife, Arlene. Larry and I played in Little League together.
FAITH=>I brought you something. Something I didn't want you to leave without.
PETER=>I was hoping for the real thing.
FAITH=>I brought you that, too.
PETER=>You do know you're insane.
PETER=>I love that in a woman.
