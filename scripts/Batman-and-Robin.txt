WIDER=>Deeper excavation has doubled the size of the cavern.
BATMAN=>Nice suit. And today you are?
ROBIN=>Nightwing. Scourge of darkest evil.
BATMAN=>This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
ROBIN=>It's the gear. Chicks love the gear.
ALFRED=>Do call if you're going to be late for dinner, sir.
ALFRED=>Drive carefully, Master Wing.
ROBIN=>Don't wait up, AL.
BATMAN=>Ten police cruisers frozen solid on the Gotham Expressway . . .
ROBIN=>... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
BATMAN=>Mr. Freeze.
ROBIN=>The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
BATMAN=>The new antiquities exhibit. The Second Sun of the Sudan.
ROBIN=>Of course. He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
BATMAN=>No, Robin. He's going to jail.
FREEZE=>The Iceman Cometh.
GUARD=>Please. Show some mercy.
FREEZE=>I'm afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy.
FREEZE=>Copsicle.
FREEZE=>In this universe, there is only one absolute. Everything...
FREEZE=>...Freezes.
FREEZE=>Bat on ice, anyone?
BATMAN=>Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with guns?
FREEZE=>You're not sending me to the cooler.
ROBIN=>Score. And the crowd goes wild.
FREEZE=>Grab the gem. Kill the heroes.
30A FREEZE=>Cop-suey.
FREEZE=>Caution. Bridge may ice over.
BATMAN=>You get the ice. I'll get the iceman.
ROBIN=>Sweet.
ROBIN=>I got mine. Where's yours?
FREEZE=>What killed the dinosaurs? The ice age.
FREEZE=>Hit me boys.
FREEZE=>Thanks for playing.
BATMAN=>Stop the insanity.
FREEZE=>Nice of you to drop in.
BATMAN=>You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
FREEZE=>I hate being lectured.
FREEZE=>Watch the numbers, Batman. For they are the harbingers of your doom.
FREEZE=>Can you feel it coming? The icy cold of space. At 30,000 feet your heart will freeze and beat no more.
FREEZE=>After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
BATMAN=>Freeze, you're mad. This capsule will slaughter thousands.
FREEZE=>Ain't it grand? Freeze well.
ROBIN=>I was just hanging around.
BATMAN=>I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
ROBIN=>How about, nice to see you? Glad you're here to save my life.
BATMAN=>When we get home, we're having a little communication workshop.
ROBIN=>Is it cold in here or is it just me?
BATMAN=>Got to make sure this rocket doesn't turn Gotham into a crater.
ROBIN=>Now what? We call a taxi?
BATMAN=>Watch the first step.
ROBIN=>Surf's up.
ROBIN=>Cool. Can we do that again?
BATMAN=>Wind.
FREEZE=>Your emotions make you weak. That is why this day is mine. Stay cool, bats.
ROBIN=>Did we get him?
PAMELA=>I still have high hopes for the animal plant cross-breedings
PAMELA=>If I can only find the correct dose of Venom, these plants will be able to fight back like animals. I will have given flora a chance against the thoughtless ravages of man.
PAMELA=>Personal note: my work would proceed faster if Dr. Woodrue weren't always whisking my Venom samples back to his mysterious Gilgamesh Wing. Why won't he let me into his lab?
PAM=>What is he doing in there?
WOODRUE=>Dr. Isley, loveliest flower in our garden. How fare our little wards?
WOODRUE=>What do we have here? A lovely new supply of Venom. I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
PAMELA=>What exactly are you working on in there? What are those screams?
WOODRUE=>How I'd love to share my secrets with you. But I ask you, sweet sapling, can you be trusted? You refuse my invitations to dine. You hide your honeyed buds behind these sallow robes.
WOODRUE=>Ah, but there's romance in the air tonight. Perhaps a moonlit stroll in the jungle. And then, later, in the dark, we can share everything.
PAMELA=>You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
WOODRUE=>You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
WOODRUE=>Ladies and gentlemen of the un-United Nations. And our mystery bidder.
WOODRUE=>I give you the future of military conquest.
WOODRUE=>May I present Antonio Diego, serial murderer serving life in prison and sole surviving volunteer.
WOODRUE=>And what a charmer he is.
WOODRUE=>The super solder serum, code named Venom, patent pending of course.
WOODRUE=>Notice the hassle free zipper.
WOODRUE=>Time to scream.
WOODRUE=>Behold, the ideal killing machine. I call this little number...Bane. Bane of humanity. Imagine it, your own personal army made up of thousands of these super soldiers. Bidding begins at a mere 10 million.
WOODRUE=>Welcome to my parlor.
WOODRUE=>...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
PAMELA=>Our work?
WOODRUE=>Without your research, I could never have come this far. Join me. The two of us, entwined, side by side...
PAMELA=>Join you? I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
WOODRUE=>Well, I can respect your opinion.
WOODRUE=>Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.
WOODRUE=>I'm afraid you'll have to die.
WOODRUE=>Fellow maniacs, bidding begins!
BRUCE=>Gotham University Labs. Security video. Two years ago.
BRUCE=>Dr. Victor Fries Two time Olympic Decathelete. Nobel Prize winner in molecular biology. After his wife contracted a rare disease, McGregor's Syndrome, he hoped to freeze her in cryogenic sleep until he could discover a cure. Here's where everything goes north.
BRUCE=>That liquid is fifty below.
DICK=>That's gotta hurt.
BRUCE=>Somehow he survived. But the cryoslution mutated his body.
DICK=>What happened to his wife?
BRUCE=>Presumed dead. No one knows.
BRUCE=>He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
DICK=>Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
BRUCE=>< Maybe it's something in the water.
BRUCE=>Well, if it's ice the iceman wants...Alfred!
BRUCE=>I need the Wayne Diamonds.
DICK=>We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
BRUCE=>Absolutely. Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
DICK=>Whoa, I made a mistake. I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me. It won't happen again.
BRUCE=>Dick, you were reckless. You could have been killed.
DICK=>I'm fine. See. Me. here. Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
ALFRED=>How, indeed?
BRUCE=>When did I become the bad guy?
BRUCE=>He's over-eager, impulsive. I can't trust him not to get hurt.
ALFRED=>Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
BRUCE=>Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
ALFRED=>Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course. You must learn to trust him. For that is the nature of family.
BRUCE=>I trust you, Alfred.
ALFRED=>But I shan't be here forever.
ALFRED=>Good night, Master Bruce.
COMPUTER=>Override engaged. Copying protected files.
ALFRED=>Still unable to reach you. have vital information you must see...
WOODRUE=>Yes, sir, I'm so pleased you won the bidding, Your Supreme Ruthlessness..
WOODRUE=>We're making the final modifications on Bane right now. We'll have a thousand super soldiers out to you tomorrow by overnight mail...
WOODRUE=>Dr. Isley? Pamela? You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
PAMELA=>Hello, Jason. I think I've had a change of heart.
PAMELA=>Quite literally. I don't think I'm human anymore. The animal-plant toxins had a rather unique effect on me. They replaced my blood with aloe, my skin with chlorophyll and fill my lips with Venom.
PAMELA=>Oh, and Jason? One other thing. Silly me, I probably should have mentioned this earlier. I'm poison. It's a jungle in here.
PAMELA=>Let the flames touch the sky. For I am nature's arm, her spirit, her will. Hell, I am mother nature. The time has come for plants to take back the world so rightfully ours. Because it's not nice to fool with mother nature.
PAMELA=>Coming, Bane darling. We've got a plane to catch.
MS. B. HAVEN=>Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
FREEZE=>I find that unlikely.
MS. B. HAVEN=>Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care. I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
FREEZE=>To be frozen. To never change. A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
MS. B. HAVEN=>What say we turn up the heat?
FREEZE=>You're skating on thin ice. My passion thaws for my bride alone.
MS. B. HAVEN=>Forget your frosty femme. These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
FREEZE=>Hop away little bunny. Before I cool your jets. Permanently.
FREEZE=>I wonder how cold I can get my shower...Frosty!
FREEZE=>Everyone is always having a good time. Except me. Try as I might, can find no pleasure. Perhaps my heart truly has turned to ice.
FREEZE=>Well, that was fun. There's hope for me yet.
FREEZE=>Do you think I'm mad, Frosty?
FROSTY=>That's really a judgment call, boss.
FREEZE=>Battling the bat exhausted my power.
FREEZE=>But I was successful nevertheless.
FREEZE=>One more giant diamond of this size and my freezing cannon will be complete. I will hold Gotham ransom. Unless the city bows to my demands, it's winter forever here in goat-town. The city fathers will have no choice but to give me the billions I need to complete my research, to find the cure for...
FREEZE=>Leave us. We need quality time.
FREEZE=>Soon we will be together once more.
FREEZE=>Nothing frustrates a man like a frigid wife.
DICK=>I got the diamond. Quell problemo, Bruce?
BRUCE=>You left your back wide open. Freeze could have killed you.
DICK=>I had it covered.
DICK=>You know, in the circus, The Flying Graysons were a team. We had to trust each other. We had to count on each person to do his part. That's what being partners is all about. End simulation.
DICK=>Where's Al?
BRUCE=>Couldn't we just for once pretend that I'm the teacher and you're the student?
ALFRED=>I must have dozed off. My sincerest apologies, sir.
BRUCE=>No apology necessary. That's the first time in thirty years.
DICK=>Mystery pizza delivery?
DICK=>Please be looking for me.
BARBARA=>I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
BARBARA=>Uncle Alfred?
BARBARA=>How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
ALFRED=>Ten years. Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
BRUCE=>Of course. Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
DICK=>Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
ALFRED=>Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
BARBARA=>Uncle Alfred left for America. Much to my mother's dismay -
ALFRED=>Eventually she married a young physician.
DICK=>Al's main squeeze. Is she here? I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
BARBARA=>My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago. Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
BRUCE=>You have?
ALFRED=>Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
BARBARA=>I'm on break from-
BRUCE=>Oxbridge Academy?
BARBARA=>Their new computer sciences division. How did you know?
BRUCE=>I recognized the accent.
BARBARA=>What is it? It's beautiful.
DICK=>You can say that again.
ALFRED=>You certainly will not.
BARBARA=>Oh no, those things frighten me.
BRUCE=>Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
ALFRED=>There's a lovely inn just down --
BARBARA=>All this luxury really isn't my style but- I'd love to stay.
BRUE=>Then it's settled.
ALFRED=>Oh, but, sir. So much goes on-
BRUCE=>Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
PAMELA=>Be gentle. He's always been touchy.
HANDLER=>Whatever you say, lady.
HANDLER=>He's always been touchy. Right.
BUSINESSMAN=>There must be some mistake --
PAMELA=>Silly darling, there's no need to pretend in front of the driver.
PAMELA=>Love hurts. In my case it kills.
PAMELA=>Once around the park.
ALFRED=>I didn't know sneaking around was on the curriculum at Oxbridge.
BARBARA=>I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in. And...
ALFRED=>You came to tuck me in. That's quite a switch. I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore. But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
BARBARA=>I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
ALFRED=>I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success. As one grows older, one yearns for family.
BARBARA=>It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
ALFRED=>As I've missed you. Sleep well, child.
FREEZE=>Maybe this time, this new formula, will return you to me.
FREEZE=>No cure tonight, my love. Forgive me. But soon, I promise you. Soon.
PAMELA=>Kind of Hip, kind of Wow, Ivy. Kind of Free, kind of Now, Ivy.
BRUCE=>My father once told me that to succeed we need only pick our star and follow it. And so Wayne Enterprises is donating the world's most advanced telescope to Gotham's Observatory Restoration Project. Perhaps this telescope will give future generations a chance to find their own stars.
GOSSIP GERTY=>Brucy, is it true this new telescope can see all around the globe?
SCIENTIST=>Yes, if you'll watch the monitors -
SCIENTIST=>Satellites already in orbit allow us to reflect light around the planet.
ASSOCIATE=>From here we'll be able to see the sky anywhere on earth.
BRUCE=>Just don't point it at my bedroom.
GOSSIP GERTY=>Brucy, you and the exquisite Julie Madison have been going out forever. Are you planning to tie the knot?
BRUCE=>Get married? me? No...
JULIE=>No!?
BRUCE=>Umm. What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
JULIE=>But soon...
GERTY=>Soon?
BRUCE=>Ah...Sooner or later...all relationships evolve and...
JULIE=>And?
BRUCE=>Can I get some help over here?
JULIE=>Bruce and I are lucky enough to be recklessly in love. And that is most certainly enough for us. For now.
SCIENTIST=>Now, if you'll all follow me, I'll show you the central control grid...
GUARD=>Mr. Wayne?
GUARD=>She doesn't have a pass, sir.
BRUCE=>They're overly protective. You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
PAMELA=>Dr. Pamela Isley.
BRUCE=>What can I do for you, Doctor? A research grant? A hospital wing?
PAMELA=>Actually, I already work for you. Or did. Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
BRUCE=>We cut our support. A conflict of ideologies. Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
PAMELA=>I see you knew him.
BRUCE=>That lab was consumed by fire last week. how did you manage to escape?
PAMELA=>I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
PAMELA=>Forget the stars. Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb. She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
BRUCE=>Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat. No coolants to preserve food. Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
PAMELA=>Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
BRUCE=>People come first, Dr. Isley.
PAMELA=>Mammals. So smug in your towers of stone and glass. A day of reckoning is coming. The same plants and flowers that saw you crawl blind from the primordial soup will reclaim this planet. Earth will be a garden again. Somehow, some way, I will bring your man-made civilization to its knees and there will be no one to protect you.
GOSSIP GERTY=>You must be new in town. In Gotham City, Batman and Robin protect us. Even from plants and flowers.
BRUCE=>Perhaps you'd like to meet them.
BRUCE=>The caped crusaders are helping us auction off a prized diamond to raise money for the Gotham Botanical Gardens. Just a few mammals doing what we can for our world's plants.
GOSSIP GERTY=>So, Brucy, will the delicious Ms. Madison be your date for the flower ball tonight?
PAMELA=>Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
BRUCE=>Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend. Thank you all. Good day, Doctor.
PAMELA=>Batman and Robin. Militant arm of the warm-blooded oppressors. Animal protectors of the status quo. First I'll rid myself of the fur and feathered pests. And then Gotham will be mine for the greening.
NORA=>Oh, Victor, it's beautiful.
FROSTY=>'Scuse me, chief. I got something her you might want to see.
FREEZE=>I hate it when people talk during the movie.
FREEZE=>One more diamond, my love. One more.
ROBIN=>You think Freeze will take the bait?
BATMAN=>He'll be here.
MC=>Ladies and Gentlemen. Gossip Gerty of Good Morning Gotham and I welcome you to the gem of our evening.
GOSSIP GERTY=>The famed Heart of Isis, on loan from the Collection of my close, personal friend Bruce Wayne.
MC=>Tonight, on auction, an opportunity to dine with one of our fabulous flowers, the famed diamond draped around her neck.
GOSSIP GERTY=>Ooo, look at all these luscious lovelies. let's start the bidding.
GOSSIP GERTY=>Boys, please. Show some gusto.
ROBIN=>Gorilla my dreams.
IVY=>Hi there.
MC=>And you are...
IVY=>Poison. Poison Ivy.
IVY=>Why not send junior to bed early, I could come and take your measurements?
IVY=>On the other hand, youth does have its advantages. Endurance. Stamina.
IVY=>Why settle for second place? Robin is a sidekick, a junior partner. If we were a team, you'd be the star. Forget the geriatric bat. Come, join me, my garden needs tending.
IVY=>I'll take it from here, pal.
IVY=>Some lucky boy's about to hit the honey pot. I'll include an evening of my company for the winner. I'll bring everything you see here. Plus everything you don't. And I'll bring my imagination.
BATMAN=>One million - -
ROBIN=>You own it. Two million - -
BATMAN=>You don't have two million. Three million - -
ROBIN=>I'll borrow it from you. Four million - -
IVY=>You two boys aren't going to fight over little old me, are you?
BATMAN=>Five million - -
ROBIN=>Six million - -
GOSSIP GERTY=>Is it getting nippy in here?
FREEZE=>Did I use the wrong door again?
215B FREEZE=>When technology fails...brute force.
215D FREEZE=>Alright, everyone, chill!
FREEZE=>I should have been a decorator.
FREEZE=>Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
IVY=>Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's. But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
FREEZE=>I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time. So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
FREEZE=>Pheromone dust. Designed to heat a man's blood. Doesn't work on the cold hearted. Now, if you please...
IVY=>Well, if you insist.
FREEZE=>Clever little clover.
FREEZE=>That's my exit cue.
BATMAN=>You have eleven minutes to thaw those guests, Commissioner.
GORDON=>Miss Ivy, you've just met one of the most sinister men in Gotham.
IVY=>That's no man. That's a God!
IVY=>Enough monkey business. We've got work to do.
BATMAN=>Pull back. You can't make the jump.
ROBIN=>I can make it.
ROBIN=>I can make it.
BATMAN=>Redbird control codes.
BATMAN=>Disable engine.
FREEZE=>It's a cold town.
FREEZE=>Uh-oh.
BATMAN=>I'm putting you on ice.
DICK=>I could have made the jump.
BATMAN=>You could have splattered your brains on the side of the building.
DICK=>This is no partnership. You're never going to trust me.
BATMAN=>Trust you? You can't even keep your head on the job. All you could think about was Poison Ivy.
DICK=>You just can't stand that she might have wanted me instead of you; that's your idea of friendship, isn't it, Bruce? You have to have everything. Your house. Your rules. Your way or the highway. It's Batman and Robin not Robin and Batman. I'm sick of it.
BRUCE=>Yes it's my rules. My rules that keep us alive. And if you want to stay in this house and on this team then you'll abide by them.
ALFRED=>I have tried every address I know for you. I am praying this reaches you. We have very little time.
ALFRED=>Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze. Batman monopolized the evening news.
BRUCE=>Thanks.
ALFRED=>Is there something wrong, sir?
BRUCE=>Alfred, am I pigheaded? Is it always my way or the highway?
ALFRED=>Why, yes, actually. Death and chance stole your parents. But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates. For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
BRUCE=>But I can't can I?
ALFRED=>No, my boy. I'm afraid none of us can.
BARBARA=>Oh. I'm so sorry. I'd just never seen anything like it. So massive. I took it out for a spin. I do so hope I didn't inconvenience you. Ah yes, the outfit. For a...costume party. Just trying it out. One never knows how leather will wear. Judo lessons at school, you know. All the rage, really. I suppose they've taken better than I thought. Again, my greatest of pardons.
HEAD GUARD=>You're the common cold. And we're the cure. Welcome home, frost face.
FREEZE=>Allow me to break the ice. My name is Freeze. Learn it well for it is the chilling sound of your doom.
GUARD=>Look at him stew. How do you like your bad guy, medium or well done?
FREEZE=>I'm afraid not. You see the means of my liberation is in your hands. Sadly, you will not live to see it.
IVY=>Batface and Birdbrain turned out to be more resistant to my love dust than expected. No matter, I'll give them a stronger dose. Next time, they'll literally be dying for me.
IVY=>A fixer-upper, yes. But with a certain homey charm.
IVY=>Ah, a minus. Current tenants.
GOLUM=>Hello, pretty.
IVY=>Hello yourself. I love this place. I hope it's priced to sell.
GOLUM=>We love you. You look good enough to eat.
IVY=>Oh, that I am. Come and get me. If you can.
IVY=>For the strong, silent type, you are most persuasive. Let's redecorate. First, the light is all wrong.
IVY=>Also, what is this floor?
IVY=>Au natural. Still, I've always hankered for something on the water.
IVY=>Now a little color. It took God seven days to create paradise.
IVY=>Let's see if I can do better.
IVY=>Bane, I've found a fellow who strikes my fancy. A cool customer, yes. Icy demeanor, no question. But I detect a certain ruthless charm I may be able to use to my advantage.
IVY=>Bruce?
JULIE=>You're not even listening to me.
BRUCE=>What? I'm sorry. You were saying...
JULIE=>We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes. Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
BRUCE=>Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
JULIE=>I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
BRUCE=>Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
JULIE=>But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
BRUCE=>I wouldn't bet on that.
JULIE=>I'm betting on you. You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now. Just think it over. Here's some food for thought.
JULIE=>Who's Ivy?
BRUCE=>What?
JULIE=>You just called me Ivy. Who's Ivy?
BRUCE=>I wish I knew.
DICK=>Enhance detail, 14 to 19.
DICK=>Who are you?
COMPUTER=>Alert! Unauthorized motion within specified parameters.
DICK=>Got ya!
BARBARA=>What's the entry fee?
BANKER=>Two-fifty.
SPIKE=>You got a handle?
BARBARA=>Folks call me Three-Jump.
SPIKE=>You're the babe won the tunnel run two nights ago. That was trike racing. This is the big time. Maybe you should ride my hog instead.
BARBARA=>How about a side bet?
SPIKE=>Crazy broad.
DICK=>So, this is where you hang out.
BARBARA=>I could have made it, you know. I didn't need your help.
DICK=>Whatever you say, lady. It's all in a day's work for me.
BARBARA=>This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
DICK=>Keep it.
BARBARA=>Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
DICK=>Hey, what's your problem?
BARBARA=>I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich. Even when they try to act like heroes.
DICK=>Well you better get comfortable real fast, sister. Cause we've only got one bike and it's a long walk home.
BARBARA=>I started racing after my parents died. There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away. You wouldn't understand.
DICK=>You'd be surprised.
BARBARA=>Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge. They kicked me out. it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
DICK=>Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
BARBARA=>Alfred has supported me my whole life. Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
DICK=>What are you talking about?
BARBARA=>Servants, Masters, it's ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
DICK=>Alfred and Bruce are like family.
BARBARA=>Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
DICK=>Alfred's happy here.
BARBARA=>Happy. You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
BARBARA=>Look at his skin. At how he's hiding the pain all the time. Can't you see it? Alfred's sick.
BRUCE=>Alfred’s not sick.
BRUCE=>He's dying. And I can't deal with it.
DICK=>But he's never said a word-
BRUCE=>You know Alfred. He'd never say Anything. But I can tell. Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had. Without him, I don't know how I would have survived. He saved my life, Dick. And I've never told him.
DICK=>Talk to him, Bruce. There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
BRUCE=>I'm scared, Dick. Maybe for the first time in my life. I'm really scared.
GUARD=>Hey Icehead, you got a visitor.
GUARD=>Your sister's here to see you.
FREEZE=>Sister?
GUARD=>Don't mind us, ma'am. You can converse freely.
PAMELA=>Oh, I don't mind you at all.
PAMELA=>You're not that attractive. Pretty average I'd say. But your fantasies aren't average, are they?
IVY=>Men. The most absurd of all God’s creatures. We give you life and we can take it back just as easily.
IVY=>What if I told you one kiss from me would kill you?
GUARD=>Right
IVY=>I really am to die for.
FREEZE=>Impressive
IVY=>Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing. So I'm here to set you free.
FREEZE=>An enticing offer. But what does the lady want in return?
IVY=>Let's cool it for now. There's someone I want you to meet.
FREEZE=>Ah, a laundry service that delivers.
IVY=>I love that belt. What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
FREEZE=>I always go a size smaller. Makes me look slimmer.
FREEZE=>They've confiscated my generator diamonds. I'm running on empty.
IVY=>Not good.
FREEZE=>No gun. How disarming.
IVY=>I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
FREEZE=>Dear daisy, don't despair.
FREEZE=>Always winterize your pipes.
IVY=>I hate heights.
FREEZE=>You'll hate prison more.
BRUCE=>Are you well, old friend?
ALFRED=>I am as well as can be expected.
BRUCE=>Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
ALFRED=>I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health. It's not civilized. I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
BRUCE=>Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
ALFRED=>Attending to heroes? No sir. My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
BRUCE=>Not all heroes wear masks.
BRUCE=>Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
ALFRED=>Yes?
342B BACK TO SCENE DICK=>Freeze has escaped.
FREEZE=>My reserves are exhausted. I must have the gems that power my suit.
IVY=>You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
FREEZE=>In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
IVY=>You leave Batman and Robin to me.
IVY=>Trust me. Vegetable magnetism.
FREEZE=>Fine. While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair. She's frozen in -
IVY=>Hold it. You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
FREEZE=>You will rescue my wife
IVY=>OK, OK. Ms. Ivy to the rescue. Now where do I find your brittle bride?
GORDON=>There's no sign he came back here after the escape. We pulled this off the surveillance cameras at Arkham.
ROBIN=>She's definitely part of this. It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about. But then...
BATMAN=>I know. The feeling just vanished.
ROBIN=>I can't believe we were fighting over a bad guy.
BATMAN=>Bad, yes. Guy, no. This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
ROBIN=>I'm totally over her. Positively.
BATMAN=>Me too. Great stems, though.
ROBIN=>Umm-hmmmm.
BATMAN=>Definitely.
ROBIN=>How did you...?
BATMAN=>Open Sesame...Chicken.
BATMAN=>She's still alive. He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome. He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
ROBIN=>Can he save her?
BATMAN=>No. Her case is too advanced. But maybe, someday, with more research-
BATMAN=>No beauty...
ROBIN=>Just the beast.
ROBIN=>Ouch. Anymore at home like you?
FREEZE=>I hate uninvited guests.
IVY=>I must confess, the combination of heroic daring-do and an anatomically correct rubber suit puts fire in a girl's...lips.
BATMAN=>Why do all the gorgeous ones have to be homicidal maniacs? Is it me?
FREEZE=>Why don't you boys slip into something more comfortable?
IVY=>Her pretty birdie.
ROBIN=>Give it up. If you threw yourself-
IVY=>At you? Polly want a kiss?
IVY=>I must be losing my touch.
FREEZE=>Stick around.
IVY=>You bring out the animal in me.
BATMAN=>I should have brought my leash.
IVY=>Enough sweet talk.
BATMAN=>You're going to jail.
IVY=>I'm a lover not a fighter. That's why every Poison Ivy action figure comes complete with...him.
IVY=>I'm off to find Bachelor Number Two. Try not to make a mess when you die.
FREEZE=>Ahh. Chilled to perfection.
FREEZE=>Superman, eat your heart out.
FREEZE=>All right coppers, Freeze.
IVY=>Stop living in the shadow of the big bad bat. You don't need him. You deserve your own legend. Your own bright shining signal in the sky. Let me guide you. Let me... ...Touch you. Kiss you.
BATMAN=>Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
ROBIN=>What are you talking about?
BATMAN=>Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
ROBIN=>A poison kiss? You have some real issues with women, you know that? You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me. Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours. Could you?!
BATMAN=>Damn.
ROBIN=>Ivy's right. I don't need you. I'm going solo. I want my own signal in the sky.
GORDON=>What happened? How'd they get away?
IVY=>So sorry, Ms. Fridigaire. I'm just not good with competition.
IVY=>Make yourself right at home.
FREEZE=>Where is my wife?
IVY=>There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her. She's dead.
FREEZE=>You lie!
IVY=>I'm sorry.
FREEZE=>Their bones will turn to ice. Their blood will freeze in my hands.
IVY=>Kill them. Of course. But why stop there? Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
FREEZE=>Yes. I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort. I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
IVY=>Just what I had in mind. Everything dead on Earth except us. A chance for mother nature to start again. Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man. Sorry hon, this is for science. Behold the dawn of a new age.
IVY=>I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals. Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe. The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them. For we will be the only two people left in the world.
FREEZE=>Adam and Evil.
FREEZE=>You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
IVY=>Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
FREEZE=>That is far too merciful. Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
IVY=>As a team, the duncely duo protect each other. But the Robin is young. Impetuous. If I could get him alone-
FREEZE=>One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face. Their secret identities would be revealed. But how best to bait a brid?
IVY=>The way to a boy's heart is through his ego. What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
FREEZE=>Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
IVY=>I'm hungry. I think I'll have poultry.
DOCTOR=>It's Stage One of McGregor's Syndrome. I'm sorry. All we can do is make him comfortable.
BRUCE=>I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death. What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
ALFRED=>Everyone dies, Master Bruce. There's no defeat in that. Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
BRUCE=>I love you, old man.
ALFRED=>Remember this. And remember it always. I'm proud of you. And I love you too, son.
DICK=>McGregor's Syndrome. That's what Freeze's wife had.
BRUCE=>Yes. But Alfred's condition is less severe. Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's. It just doesn't say how.
DICK=>I checked the medical database. No one else is even close.
BRUCE=>I'm late for the dedication. Then I go after Freeze and Ivy. Alone.
DICK=>Like hell you do.
BRUCE=>Dick, don't push me right now.
DICK=>Or what? No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat. Crap! You just want her for yourself. Don't you? Answer me, damn it!
BRUCE=>Yes! Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it. That's the whole point. Look at us. Orphans. Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family. We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
DICK=>Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
BRUCE=>She's clouded your mind. You're not thinking straight.
DICK=>Oh but I am. For the first time in a long time. I'm through living in your shadow. All that ends right now.
JULIE=>I've been ringing forever. Where's Alfred?
BARBARA=>I'm sorry. I was too late.
ALFRED=>Too late for what, dear child?
BARBARA=>I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
ALFRED=>I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know. I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
ALFRED=>You must do something for me.
ALFRED=>Find my brother Wilfred. Give him This. I have duties he must fulfill in my stead. Only family can be trusted.
BARBARA=>What is it?
ALFRED=>It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son. Take it, child. But I implore you, never open it. You look so like your mother.
BARBARA=>Uncle Alfred?
VOICE=>I've always wondered, where does that big old bat light come from?
GORDON=>It's on top of police headquarters.
PAMELA=>I'd just love to see it. But you probably don't have access.
GORDON=>Why, I'm Commissioner of Police. I have the keys right here.
PAMELA=>On second thought, you're way too old for me.
BRUCE=>Dr. Isley. it was like I could feel you in the room. You're...enchanting. Gorgeous. The most beautiful woman I've ever seen. If you're..um... free...this evening.
JULIE=>Bruce? What are you doing?
PAMELA=>I think he's asking me on a date, in an awkward, stammering sort of way.
JULIE=>I've heard of commitment anxiety, but this is insane. You're not really propositioning another woman right in front of me. Are you?
BRUCE=>Well, define 'propositioning'.
JULIE=>Make a choice, Bruce. Her or me.
BRUCE=>Well...um...her.
JULIE=>You were right. I get it. You're not the marrying kind. You've made your point. Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
PAMELA=>Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
BRUCE=>I can't. But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
PAMELA=>Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions. So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment. Got me?
BRUCE=>Does that mean dinner's a no?
BRUCE=>It's just I sort of...kind of ...love you.
FREEZE=>Bundle up boys. There's a storm coming.
IVY=>Let there be light.
BARBARA=>Only family can be trusted?
COMPUTER=>Access denied. Protected files.
BARBARA=>Perhaps you didn’t give me your genes. But you gave me your heart.
BRUCE=>Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
ALFRED=>Right here, sir.
ALFRED=>I anticipated a moment might arrive where I became...incapacitated. As such, I programmed my brain algorithms into the batcomputer and created a virtual simulation.
BRUCE=>It's good to see you.
ALFRED=>What seems to be the problem?
BRUCE=>Women.
ALFRED=>That, sir, does not compute.
BRUCE=>First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me. Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
ALFRED=>Specify, please.
BRUCE=>Pamela Isley. I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly. I still can't. She used to work for Wayne Enterprises. Find a file.
ALFRED=>Coming on line now, sir.
BRUCE=>What was her area of research?
ALFRED=>Advanced botany. DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
BRUCE=>Pheromones?
ALFRED=>Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions. Fear. Rage...
BRUCE=>Passion. Of course. Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
BRUCE=>Deconstruct and resolve.
BRUCE=>Amazing what a good wig and contact lenses can do. And I thought Clark Kent got away with murder just wearing those glasses.
BRUCE=>What is it?
ALFRED=>It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
COMPUTER=>Access code accepted.
BARBARA=>This better be one hell of a secret.
BARBARA=>Oh my God.
FREEZE=>No matter what they tell you, it's the size of your gun that counts.
DICK=>That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
BRUCE=>Her name is Pamela Isley. I saw her talking to Gordon. She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
DICK=>And she did it all for me. For love.
BRUCE=>She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
DICK=>Is that it, Bruce? I'm under some magic spell?
BRUCE=>She wants to kill you.
DICK=>You'd say anything to keep me away from her. To keep her for yourself.
BRUCE=>You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner. That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win. DO you remember?
BRUCE=>You weren't just talking about being partners. You were talking about being a family. Well, part of our family is dying. I'm not going to lose everyone I've ever loved. So I'm asking you now, friend, partner, brother - will you trust me?
FREEZE=>Hi. Sorry about the door. Is the party over?
SCIENTIST=>Who the hell is this nutball?
FREEZE=>That's Mr. Nutball to you. Half a set of bookends. You. Go like this.
FREEZE=>No. move your hands up. Higher. Now a hint more fear. Excellent.
FREEZE=>A matched pair. Sometimes I exceed even my wildest expectations.
FREEZE=>If revenge is a dish best served cold, then put on your Sunday finest. It's time to feast.
BARBARA=>Uncle Alfred?
ALFRED=>In spirit only, I'm afraid.
BARBARA=>The boys need help.
ALFRED=>Your mother would be proud.
ALFRED=>Forgive my being personal, dear girl, but I must know your size.
ROBIN=>Is your thumb the only part of you that's green?
IVY=>You'll just have to find out.
FREEZE=>Big family? Like pets? Don't talk much, do you?
IVY=>I'm glad you came. I can't breathe without you.
ROBIN=>I want us to be together. But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf. I need a sign.
IVY=>How about dangerous curves?
ROBIN=>Of trust. Tell me your plan.
IVY=>Kiss me and I'll tell you.
ROBIN=>Tell me and I'll kiss you.
IVY=>Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun. He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
ROBIN=>I've got to stop him.
IVY=>One kiss, my love. For luck.
IVY=>Bad luck, I'm afraid. It's time to die, little bird.
ROBIN=>What do you mean?
IVY=>You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal. These lips can be murder.
ROBIN=>Then you never loved me?
IVY=>Love you? I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
VOICE=>I'm not saying I told you so.
IVY=>You're too late. Say bye-bye birdie.
ROBIN=>Sorry to disappoint you. But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
428A BATMAN=>Robin and I found the cure to your evil spell. And that's teamwork.
IVY=>Sorry, boys, my vines have a little crush on you.
IVY=>Gotta run. So many people to kill. So little time.
BATGIRL=>You're about to become compost.
BATGIRL=>Using feminine wiles to get what you want. Trading on your looks. Exploiting men's weakness for sex. Read a book, sister. That passive- aggressive crap went out in the seventies. Chicks like you give women a bad name.
IVY=>As I told Lady Freeze when I pulled her plug, this is a one woman show.
BATGIRL=>I don't think so.
438A BATMAN=>And you are?
BATGIRL=>Batgirl.
BATMAN=>That's not awfully PC. How about Batwoman? Batperson?
BATGIRL=>It's me. Barbara. I found the cave.
ROBIN=>We gotta get those locks changed.
BATMAN=>She knows who we are.
ROBIN=>I guess we'll just have to kill her.
BATMAN=>Kill her later. We've got work to do.
FREEZE=>1-Adam 12, 1-Adam-12, see the mad scientist with the freezing ray.
FREEZE=>Cops on the rocks, anyone?
FREEZE=>Police are so hot tempered these days. Don't you agree, Mr. Bane?
FREEZE=>The Bat-allion approaches. Icemen. Attack.
BATMAN=>Attack plan alpha.
ROBIN=>Alpha. Roger.
BATGIRL=>Alpha. Got it. What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
ROBIN=>Divide and conquer.
ROBIN=>Tack.
ROBIN=>Boy, I hope Freeze hires these guys by the dozen.
BATGIRL=>Nice extras package.
BATGIRL=>That's what I call a close shave.
BATMAN=>Don't sink and drive.
FREEZE=>Not so fast. Time you cooled your heals.
ROBIN=>Youwsa! Nothing but air.
BATGIRL=>Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
FREEZE=>Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on. Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
BATMAN=>We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
BATGIRL=>This is easy.
ROBIN=>Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
BATGIRL=>Why?
BATGIRL=>Does this mean we're going steady?
BATMAN=>Let's do this the old-fashioned way.
ROBIN=>Crimefighter's rule number two.
BATGIRL=>I'm afraid to ask.
ROBIN=>Be ready for anything.
BATGIRL=>Pow! What! Kazow!
ROBIN=>What exactly are you doing?
BATGIRL=>I don't know. It just feels right.
BATMAN=>No sign of the snowman.
ROBIN=>Maybe he melted.
513A BATGIRL=>I hope you've got about ten million more of those little toys.
BATMAN=>Sunlight could reverse the freezing process.
BATGIRL=>Sunrise isn't for five hours.
BATMAN=>Here.
ROBIN=>But it's morning in the Congo.
BATMAN=>If we could relay the sunlight-
ROBIN=>From the other side of the equator-
BATGIRL=>It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
ROBIN=>Damn? Damn is not good.
BATGIRL=>Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
BATMAN=>I'll set the telescope. You two thaw the mirrors.
BATGIRL=>I love this belt. Can I get a matching handbag?
BATMAN=>Who ever thought Aunt Harriet's typing lessons would lead to this?
FREEZE=>Tonight's forecast... ...a freeze is coming!
BATMAN=>Millions will die so you can save on air conditioning. Isn't that taking self help a little too far?
FREEZE=>We aim to... ...Freeze.
FREEZE=>That's new. Let's swing.
SCIENTIST=>This just isn't my day.
551B ASSOCIATE=>Up, up and away.
551D SCIENTIST=>PhDs rule!
BATMAN=>You've turned Gotham to ice. You've endangered countless lives. It's payback time.
ROBIN=>I've got you.
VOICE=>Wow. Batman.
SCIENTIST=>I've seen you on TV.
BATMAN=>Nice to meet you. Can you give me any more height on this thing?
SCIENTIST=>Going up.
BATMAN=>You're loosing your cool
FREEZE=>I think not. There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight. You'll get a charge out of this.
575A ROBIN=>Now that's what I call an exit.
BATGIRL=>Please tell me he's on our side.
580B BATGIRL=>Don't worry. I've got him.
ROBIN=>No. I've got him.
580E ROBIN=>You should get that suit taken in. No one's buying baggy anymore.
BATMAN=>Grab my belt and hang on.
BATMAN=>This is your stop.
ROBIN=>Winded, old timer?
BATMAN=>Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
BATGIRL=>It's midnight. The telescope's gone. There's no way to thaw the city.
BATMAN=>Theoretically, the satellites could be positioned to thaw the city directly. But it would take a computer genius.
ROBIN=>I'm on it.
BATGIRL=>No. I'm on it.
BATGIRL=>Ms. Genius. Madame Genius. Her Geniusness. Which sounds better?
FREEZE=>Go on, kill me too. Just as you killed my wife.
BATMAN=>I didn't kill your wife.
BATMAN=>Run Ivy evidence tape 001.40.
IVY=>As I told Lady Freeze when I pulled her plug, this is a one woman show.
BATMAN=>But she's not dead, Victor. We found her, restored her icy slumber.
BATMAN=>She's still frozen, Victor, alive, waiting for you to find a cure. I know what it's like to lose everything you've ever loved. But vengeance isn't power. Any two-bit thug with a gun can take a life. To give life, that's true power, a power you once had. I don't know if you'll ever find a cure for your wife. But I'm asking you now, Doctor Victor Fries, to save another life. Show me how to cure McGregor's Syndrome Stage One. And maybe you can also save the man your wife once loved. He's still inside you, buried somewhere deep beneath the snow. Will you help me? Doctor?
FREEZE=>Take two of these and call me in the morning.
BATMAN=>All we can do now is wait. And hope.
IVY=>He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. he loves me...
VOICE=>Not.
FREEZE=>It's amazing what you can buy around here for a few dozen diamonds.
FREEZE=>Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
IVY=>Not good.
BRUCE=>Alfred, are you...?
ALFRED=>Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping. And quite well, it seems. Thanks to you, son. Thanks to you all.
DICK=>One question. When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
BRUCE=>I knew you could handle it.
BRUCE=>Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
BARBARA=>Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt. Personally. Me. I did.
BRUCE=>You are going back to school.
DICK=>You're never going to win this argument, Bruce.
BARBARA=>Partners?
ALFRED=>We're going to need a bigger cave.
