FELIX=>I CAN FIX IT!!!
RALPH=>It’s not like I’m complaining. Well, it’s a little like I’m complaining. But I get it. I been doing this long enough to know a steady arcade gig’s nothing to sneeze at.
CY-BORG=>Yeah! Inside HERE!
RALPH=>Thanks, Satan.
RALPH=>Wreck-it Ralph.
SURGE PROTECTOR=>And where you coming from?
SURGE PROTECTOR=>I get that a lot. Proceed.
RALPH=>Evening...oops.
GENE=>Yes, you are.
ROY=>Is he serious?
GAME ANNOUNCER=>On a planet with no name. A top secret experiment has gone horribly wrong.
RALPH=>I love my momma!
FELIX=>Oh my land. Where is he?
RALPH=>Get off my face!
RALPH=>Aahhh! Nooooooo!
RALPH=>Nowhere to hide!
RALPH=>Get back here.
VANELLOPE=>Hero’s Doodie?! Ha!
RALPH=>Leave me alone.
RALPH=>You better win.
FELIX=>Is he in there?
VANELLOPE=>Hey, we shook on it.
VANELLOPE=>Thank you, Jeeves.
VANELLOPE=>We gotta make one.
VANELLOPE=>Yes! Come on, get up, Ralph! Fifteen seconds!
RALPH=>You don’t what?!
VANELLOPE=>Head for Diet Cola Mountain!
RALPH=>There you go. Okay, now--
KING CANDY=>Where are you? Let’s see.... Stadium.... Jumbotron. There it is the “Winner’s Cup.”
KING CANDY=>Sour Bill, I’m going out. You’re in charge of the castle until I get back.
RALPH=>Okay. Come on.
KING CANDY=>Ralph, there you are! Hello!
RALPH=>...About what?
KING CANDY=>All my subjects will be homeless. But there’s one who cannot escape, because she’s a glitch.
VANELLOPE=>Help! Somebody help!
VANELLOPE=>Will ya just do it!
VANELLOPE=>Now close your eyes.
RALPH=>No, you’re not.
RALPH=>I’ll lick you.
RALPH=>Suit yourself.
SOUR BILL=>But I do know this. He’ll do anything to keep her from racing, because if she crosses the finish line, the game will reset and she won’t be a glitch anymore.
CALHOUN=>Ugh. Saccharine-saturated nightmare.
RALPH=>A...Stink brain?
KING CANDY=>Get off this track!
VANELLOPE=>What? Who are you?!
VANELLOPE=>Just go without me.
RALPH=>No. Just for me.
RACERS=>What?! No, please!
RALPH=>Hasta la vista...
