JENNIFER=>Anything's better than Mark.
FRIDA=>My shrink says he's not so bad.
JENNIFER=>Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
FRIDA=>He's a very talented musician.
JENNIFER=>Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
FRIDA=>I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
JENNIFER=>So don't look in his eyes. Two guys passing by on the street check out Jennifer. One of them stops in front of her.
GUY=>That's the girl who should be havin' my baby.
JENNIFER=>Yeah, that's likely. She rolls her eyes and walks around the gawking guy. Frida and Jennifer continue walking in silence for a moment.
FRIDA=>I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
JENNIFER=>People notice you Frida. Another guy gawking at Jennifer, isn't watching where he's going and bumps smack into Frida.
FRIDA=>Oh, uh, sorry. The guy, still not noticing Frida, keeps walking and turns
JENNIFER=>So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
GEORGE=>Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off. Jennifer, George and Carlton laugh.
JENNIFER=>But coyote ugly... well it's so totally offensive... it's when a guy wakes up with a girl sleeping on his arm. He looks over, and she's so ugly that he chews through his own arm to get away from her. Carlton and George crack up. Too much. PULL BACK to reveal Frida, also sitting at the table, though a bit apart from the other three, picking meekly at her salad. Jennifer looks over and sees Frida's not having a good time.
JENNIFER=>Have you heard of that Frida? Frida looks up from her plate of leaves.
FRIDA=>Sorry? I guess I wasn't listening. I just have really bad PMS. A total mood killer. Jennifer, George and Carlton just stare at Frida. Jennifer puts her fork down and clears her throat.
JENNIFER=>Uh, Frida... sorry about the steak house. It's Carlton's favorite.
CARLTON=>How come you're a vegetarian?
FRIDA=>When I was a kid, we couldn't eat meat on Fridays. I loved Fridays because of that. Now I can't stand the thought of eating bloody flesh. Jennifer, George and Carlton look down at their rare steaks. Suddenly they don't look so great.
FRIDA=>He hasn't said one word to me.
JENNIFER=>Maybe he's just shy.
FRIDA=>My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
JENNIFER=>Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
FRIDA=>Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
JENNIFER=>I get a little bloated sometimes.
FRIDA=>I'd kill for just a little bloated. We hear a toilet FLUSH.
GEORGE=>It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
CARLTON=>That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that. GEORGE
CARLTON=>What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life. They laugh.
GEORGE=>I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
CARLTON=>I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
GEORGE=>My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
CARLTON=>Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome. They both laugh.
FRIDA=>I always say the wrong thing. I shouldn't have come. Frida catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror.
FRIDA=>I'm coyote ugly. Jennifer looks at Frida through the mirror.
JENNIFER=>How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just
FRIDA=>You're just saying that. Jennifer squints at Frida for a closer look. She pulls Frida's hair out of the ponytail and tries to fluff it up. She takes off Frida's glasses.
JENNIFER=>Do you really need these?
FRIDA=>Only to see.
JENNIFER=>Can't you get contacts?
FRIDA=>No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
JENNIFER=>Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes. She snaps open Frida's purse and drops the glasses inside. Frida looks at herself in the mirror. We see her POV and it's out of focus.
CARLTON=>You two must be in sync.
JENNIFER=>Excuse me?
GEORGE=>He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
JENNIFER=>Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
FRIDA=>Or if there's a full moon.
JENNIFER=>Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
FRIDA=>I'm so sorry! I'm such a clutz. She fishes in her purse for her glasses and puts them on as Jennifer helps her wipe up the spilled drink.
FRIDA=>Yes, I do think it's important to tell the Mother Teresa story... but no way can I pitch that to my boss.
MAN=>Why the hell not?
FRIDA=>It won't get the ratings. He only wants "women in jeopardy" stories.
MAN=>How about if Mother Teresa's being stalked by the Pope?
FRIDA=>Only if Jane Seymour plays Mother Teresa and Richard Chamberlain plays the Pope. It's just not for us. I'm sorry. Good luck with it. Frida hears the phone slam down and a dialtone. She hangs up just as her boss, MR. GRANT, barges in and barks at her.
MR. GRANT=>The Nielson's?
FRIDA=>On your desk. MR. GRANT
FRIDA=>On your desk.
MR. GRANT=>Coffee and...
FRIDA=>Your desk. Mr. Grant abruptly turns and heads back into his office.
FRIDA=>There was a script I wanted to talk to you about... I thought maybe... She gets up with a script. As she does, she spills her coffee all over the desk.
FRIDA=>... I could produce it. Mr. Grant ignores her and slams the door to his office. Frida wipes up the spilled coffee with the script.
FRIDA=>I had a dream last night, that I was a doormat. CUT TO:
BACK TO SHRINK'S OFFICE=>The shrink makes a note.
SHRINK=>And what do you think this means? Frida stares at the shrink for a second, surprised he doesn't get such an obvious reference.
FRIDA=>That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
SHRINK=>Oh, I see... interesting theory.
JENNIFER=>Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
FRIDA=>What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
JENNIFER=>It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
FRIDA=>I don't know.
JENNIFER=>There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
FRIDA=>Where are all the mediums?
JENNIFER=>Frida, grab that red one. Jennifer's finger points to a red panty and Frida snatches it and gives it to her. WOMAN 2 Large, small. No fucking mediums. More and more hands pick through the bras and panties, with increasing fervor. Frida's hand grabs a pair of blue panties.
FRIDA=>Jennifer, I got a medium! As Frida pulls the pair of panties out of the pile, she realizes an OLIVE-SKINNED WOMAN is grabbing the other end of the panties. They have a bit of a tug of war over it.
OLIVE WOMAN=>That's mine!
FRIDA=>No I had it first. The tug of war continues. Frida and the Olive Woman both refuse to let go. It looks like they're about to rip when the Olive Woman's head comes into frame -- the back of her head fills the frame with brunette curls. Frida screams.
FRIDA=>OUCH!
FRIDA=>Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
JENNIFER=>And she got the medium.
FRIDA=>Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra. Frida looks at her wrist, which is beginning to swell.
FRIDA=>I think she broke the skin.
JENNIFER=>What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
FRIDA=>George bit you?
JENNIFER=>I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away... Frida looks at Jennifer uncomfortably. Jennifer smiles to herself, reminiscing.
DOCTOR=>A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
FRIDA=>At Victoria's Secret. The doctor looks up from his clipboard, confused.
FRIDA=>There was a sale.
DOCTOR=>I mean where on your body?
FRIDA=>Oh, on my wrist. She holds it up for him to see. He takes a look at it.
DOCTOR=>A dog at Victoria's Secret?
FRIDA=>No, it was another woman. The doctor seems skeptical. He examines her wrist closer. DOCTOR
DOCTOR=>How's the rest of your health?
FRIDA=>Good. Except for PMS. The doctor resists the temptation to roll his eyes.
DOCTOR=>PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
FRIDA=>It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
DOCTOR=>That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
FRIDA=>What else is there?
DOCTOR=>And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
FRIDA=>It's not just in my head. The doctor snaps his folder shut and heads for the door.
DOCTOR=>I'll send a nurse in to clean that bite and give you a tetanus shot. And a rabies shot... just in case.
FRIDA'S MOM=>It's mom. I ran into Herman today. I wish you'd move back home and marry him. He's got a great job at Penneys. I don't know why you're in New York with all those freaks.
FRIDA=>Sammy? Seafood Feast? Frida sniffs the cat food as though it smells good to her. She nearly eats some -- then shakes her head, realizing it was a crazy thought. She stands up and sniffs around her kitchen. She searches the cupboards. Then the refrigerator. It's full of fruit and vegetables. The other cupboard has healthy stuff as well. Frida slams the cupboard shut. Obviously not finding what she's looking for. A MONTAGE with jump cuts as Frida paces in circles. She clips her fingernails and toenails, which are quite long and thick. She goes to the refrigerator, opens the door, looks in and closes the door. She does this several times as if its contents will change the next time she opens it. She paces faster and faster in a tighter circle. She feels claustrophobic in her clothes and practically rips them off.
BRUNO=>Jesus Christ! He pulls his hand from his face to reveal large bloody scratches on his cheek. He looks up at Frida, but she's gone.
FRIDA=>Sammy? Frida gets up and notices the cat food dish is empty. She opens a can of cat food. The cat's nowhere to be seen.
GREGORY=>Didn't mean to scare ya. It's Frida, right? I'm Gregory. From accounting. Frida's a little uneasy about him staring at her chest.
FRIDA=>I know.
GREGORY=>So you're Grant's secretary?
FRIDA=>I do development for TV movies.
GREGORY=>Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay. Frida tries to avoid cringing.
FRIDA=>You're kidding, really?
GREGORY=>No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
LLOYD=>Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
PETER=>Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
LLOYD=>You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
PETER=>You're some catch Lloyd.
LLOYD=>Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
FRIDA=>Jennifer, you're early... She opens the door and sees MARK, the guy from the photo she'd put face down. Mark is cute, but a bit of a geek. He does have the nice brown eyes Frida mentioned earlier. He carries a McDonald's bag and is eating a French fry.
FRIDA=>What are you doing here Mark? He pushes his way past her and into the apartment.
MARK=>I missed you. I wanted to see you. Frida's skeptical.
MARK=>Hey what's all this stuff? He shoves aside some of the makeup and puts down his McDonald's bag on the table.
FRIDA=>Jennifer's giving me a makeover. Mark takes a burger out of the bag and unwraps it. Frida sniffs at the burger.
MARK=>What, you got a date or somethin'?
FRIDA=>Since when do you care? Frida lustily eyes the burger. Mark sees her check it out.
MARK=>Sorry, I know you hate the sight of meat. Mark looks at Frida for a moment -- for the first time really since he barged in.
MARK=>You look different. I mean you look good.
FRIDA=>You never say that.
MARK=>You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
FRIDA=>No. He walks closer to her. Frida backs up. Mark moves in closer, puts his arms around her and tries to kiss her. Frida turns her head away from his kiss. She looks down and sees the burger, which sits on the table behind Mark. ECU of the burger looking delicious like in a commercial. Frida sniffs and makes a little moan -- she's completely focused on the burger. Mark thinks she's moaning for him, and he continues kissing her neck. As he does, Frida reaches down, picks up the burger and takes a huge bite out of it. CLOSE ON Frida's face as we see her sheer near-orgasmic enjoyment of the burger. Suddenly Mark jerks away.
MARK=>OUCH! Shit! What the fuck? He twists his arm to reach around to feel his back. Completely ignoring Mark's pain, Frida takes a few more chomps of the burger as though she hasn't eaten in days. Mark lifts his shirt, which is ripped. He sees in the mirror that his back has huge bleeding scratches on it.
MARK=>Look what you did!
FRIDA=>Oh my god, I'm sorry!
MARK=>Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
FRIDA=>I can't help it, it smells so good. Frida finishes the burger with an enormous bite and then runs into the bathroom and gets rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball.
MARK=>Fuck you have sharp nails.
MARK=>OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
FRIDA=>Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
MARK=>Frida, you know you're it for me.
FRIDA=>Yeah right... You better go. Frida pulls him towards the door. Mark grabs his empty burger wrapper and fries.
MARK=>Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
FRIDA=>You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
MARK=>I'm working on it... Frida rolls her eyes. She drags him and pushes him out the door. Mark's surprised by how strong Frida is. Frida slams the door and locks it.
FRIDA=>Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
JENNIFER=>Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
FRIDA=>You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
JENNIFER=>What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my
FRIDA=>Maybe they have to pee.
JENNIFER=>Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
FRIDA=>I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
JENNIFER=>They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something. Frida looks worried. She picks up a big hand mirror on the table and looks at herself.
FRIDA=>Oh my god, I have a mustache! Jennifer looks closely at Frida's face.
JENNIFER=>Where?
FRIDA=>Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
JENNIFER=>I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
FRIDA=>Holy shit, I'm a freak.
JENNIFER=>You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal. Jennifer brushes Frida's hair. She pauses and looks at Frida's eyes.
JENNIFER=>Hey, did you get contacts?
FRIDA=>(suddenly realizing she's not
GREGORY=>You hungry?
FRIDA=>Starving. A waiter hands each of them a menu.
GREGORY=>Have whatever you want. My treat. They each look at menus. The entrees are listed from lighter fair down to steaks. CU of each menu item and its price. Frida does a double-take at her menu. Instead of seeing a dollar amount, Frida reads it like this, "Chef's Salad = French Kissing and Groping; Pasta Special = Heavy Petting and Breast Feel; Chicken Marsala = Blow Job; Steak Frites = Regular Fucking; Surf and Turf Lobster = Kinky Sex till you're sore."
GREGORY=>Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
FRIDA=>I'm not really hungry after all.
GREGORY=>You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat. Frida hungrily eyes a steak the waiter passes by with. She inhales deeply.
FRIDA=>Maybe just one little steak...
GREGORY=>My senior year, I was waiting for that letter from Harvard. I'd heard from Yale. Got in. Brown, MIT, got in. But Harvard... here's the suspense... a letter comes...
GREGORY=>Okay let's face it, I got into Harvard cause my dad donated $50,000. I barely got a thousand on my SATs and was kicked outta prep school, but hey, that's life. I have a really small penis. Which is why I tell stories about how great I am. I'm also losing my hair and I have no interest in a relationship. I just want you to like my screenplay idea but I do expect you to fuck me later... The camera's still on Frida as she's eating. She looks up at Gregory again momentarily as he snaps back into focus.
GREGORY=>So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
GREGORY=>Well, whattdaya think?
FRIDA=>That's great. Highly original. Frida cleans her plate with her finger and licks it. Gregory stares at her. He's only half finished -- he's been busy talking, and she's been busy eating. Frida eyes his half- eaten steak and points at it with her fork.
FRIDA=>Are you gonna finish that?
FRIDA=>I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner. GREGORY
FRIDA=>I'm really tired.
GREGORY=>Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
FRIDA=>No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
GREGORY=>They say sex is great for cramps.
FRIDA=>Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory. She tries to push him aside from the door. He doesn't budge. In fact he leans closer to Frida. She can feel his breath.
GREGORY=>Can I use your bathroom? Frida spins around.
FRIDA=>What?
GREGORY=>I really gotta pee.
FRIDA=>You should have gone at the restaurant.
GREGORY=>I didn't have to pee then.
FRIDA=>My apartment's just such a mess.
GREGORY=>That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
FRIDA=>Oh come on. Knock it off.
GREGORY=>Knock what off?
FRIDA=>You don't have to pee.
GREGORY=>Yes I do have to pee!
FRIDA=>You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
GREGORY=>I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
FRIDA=>Uh huh. So pee.
GREGORY=>So pee? Here?
FRIDA=>Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right? Gregory looks at her, not sure if she's serious. Then he takes a step back and looks around to make sure no one's watching. He then unzips his pants and pees. Frida has the urge to laugh for a moment, but then she holds it back. An awkward moment as Gregory takes a really long time to pee. He looks over at Frida once or twice, and they exchange an awkward glance. Finally he's done and he zips up his pants. Frida and Gregory look at each other. Frida's eyes seem to glow. She takes a step towards him. Gregory's taken off guard as Frida grabs him and kisses him. FADE TO WHITE and dissolve into next scene.
FRIDA=>Thank god. Frida looks around and squints. Her vision's blurry. She grabs her glasses and puts them on. She sees Sammy curled up at the foot of her bed, purring. She pets him.
FRIDA=>Even you know when PMS is over.
FRIDA=>It was like I woke up in a murder scene. It took me a few seconds to realize it was just my period. I must have had a bad dream. Peter and Lloyd are at the end of the hallway looking at Frida and Jennifer, but the women don't notice them.
PETER=>We're looking for Frida Harris. Frida and Jennifer turn and see Peter and Lloyd approaching.
FRIDA=>I'm Frida Harris. Her eyes lock with Peter's. There's some attraction there, but we don't dwell on the moment too long. LLoyd is in no way subtle checking out both women.
PETER=>We're police detectives. Frida feels guilty. She's not sure why. Maybe just cause she's Catholic.
LLOYD=>It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
FRIDA=>Oh my god, what happened?
PETER=>He was found a few blocks away.
LLOYD=>Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess. Frida looks down at her laundry and sees the bloody sheet on the top. Peter and LLoyd look down and see it too.
FRIDA=>I had a little accident. Jennifer sees Frida is embarrassed. Both men stare at her bloody sheet. Lloyd clears his throat.
JENNIFER=>Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
PETER=>Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
FRIDA=>Yes... I... we had dinner.
LLOYD=>Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
FRIDA=>No, it was our first date.
LLOYD=>Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral. Lloyd chuckles. Peter shoots him a look.
PETER=>When's the last time you saw him?
FRIDA=>We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
LLOYD=>A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
FRIDA=>No, I said it was our first date.
JENNIFER=>How the hell is that your business?
PETER=>We're just trying to figure out what happened.
FRIDA=>I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
PETER=>Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call. Peter tries to hand Frida a business card, but she has no hands free so he puts it on her bloody sheet. Lloyd can't keep his eyes off the bloody sheet.
LLOYD=>Uh... mind if we take those sheets
JENNIFER=>You want her sheets?
PETER=>We can just take this pillowcase.
LLOYD=>We can get a warrant if you like.
FRIDA=>No, take it. Peter slips on a glove and picks up the pillowcase with the bloody handprint on it. He's nearly as embarrassed as Frida. Their eyes lock for a moment, then they both avert their gazes.
PETER=>Sorry.
FRIDA=>He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
JENNIFER=>There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
FRIDA=>And he was ripped limb from limb?
JENNIFER=>I'm sure they were exaggerating.
FRIDA=>Why would they exaggerate?
JENNIFER=>To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back. Jennifer looks up at Frida, who looks overwhelmed.
JENNIFER=>So did you do it?
FRIDA=>Did I kill him? Of course not!
JENNIFER=>No, did you fuck him?
FRIDA=>No. I don't think so.
JENNIFER=>You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
FRIDA=>I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
JENNIFER=>Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
FRIDA=>I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
JENNIFER=>I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
FRIDA=>I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
JENNIFER=>What? Why the hell did he do that?
FRIDA=>He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
JENNIFER=>And then?
FRIDA=>I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
JENNIFER=>At least your PMS is over.
FRIDA=>And my bra finally fits again. Jennifer folds some of George's boxer shorts. JENNIFER
FRIDA=>My vision got worse again. Frida pulls out a pair of men's briefs from the dryer. Jennifer eyes them suspiciously.
JENNIFER=>Are those Mark's?
FRIDA=>No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
JENNIFER=>Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that. Frida picks up Peter's card.
FRIDA=>He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
JENNIFER=>Rule one: always wear make-up.
FRIDA=>I wonder if he's married.
JENNIFER=>He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar. Frida leaves the briefs on the laundry table. She notices they're ripped.
LLOYD=>I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
PETER=>That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
LLOYD=>Hell no, I'm not into that shit.
PETER=>Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
LLOYD=>No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
PETER=>I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
LLOYD=>Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
JENNIFER=>Your nails are so tough and pointy. What is this stuff under them? Jennifer scrapes what looks like flesh from under her nails. The phone rings.
FRIDA=>Ignore it. It's probably my mom. The machine picks up.
FRIDA=>Hi it's Frida. Leave a message! The machine beeps.
MARK=>Frida, Frida, Frida. I get so hot thinking about yesterday. My scratches have almost healed and I'm ready for more. Jennifer freezes.
JENNIFER=>Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
FRIDA=>Um, he stopped by yesterday before
JENNIFER=>Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
FRIDA=>I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
JENNIFER=>Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
MR. GRANT=>Find me that "Woman in Jeopardy" story. He starts to pass by as usual, then stops, stares at Frida, looking her up and down. He's noticed something has changed.
FRIDA=>How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
MR. GRANT=>Did you change your hair?
FRIDA=>A little. Mr. Grant nods and continues on his way. Frida gives him the look of death.
FRIDA=>I had the strangest dream -- that I was really hungry, and I was chasing someone... I think I was some sort of animal. And my sex drive... it's embarrassing but I've had these sexual dreams too. The shrink leans forward eagerly.
SHRINK=>Anything about bestiality?
FRIDA=>What's that?
LLOYD=>Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
PETER=>I told you she was innocent.
LLOYD=>Hey, there was a lot of blood.
PETER=>She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
LLOYD=>I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
PETER=>Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
LLOYD=>Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
PETER=>Madonna's in Penthouse?
LLOYD=>Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
PETER=>Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state. Lloyd gives Peter a grossed out, horrified look.
PETER=>What?
LLOYD=>And you think I'm sick?
FRIDA=>Thank you for your submission of "Woman on the Tracks." Although the story of a woman being rescued by Fabio after being tied to the train tracks is indeed the kind of lame ass "Women in Jeopardy" genre that my company seeks, I cannot of sound mind pass this script on to anyone. In a nutshell: it sucks. Mr. Grant walks by and dumps a few scripts on Frida's desk.
FRIDA=>Wait. Mr. Grant. He keeps walking. Frida rises and speaks with more authority.
FRIDA=>Mr. Grant. He stops in his tracks, surprised at her tone. He turns around slowly.
FRIDA=>I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
MR. GRANT=>Yes, that's what we're looking for.
FRIDA=>I think we should do something with strong female characters...
MR. GRANT=>I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk. Mr. Grant walks into his office. Frida sits down, satisfied and surprised she had the nerve to speak to him like that.
DOCTOR=>That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
FRIDA=>Nearly four. DOCTOR
FRIDA=>Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
DOCTOR=>Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
FRIDA=>I get crazy dreams and I black out.
DOCTOR=>Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
FRIDA=>Does she have PMS?
DOCTOR=>Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
MONTAGE=>of Frida dieting and exercising -- eating carrots and salads. Working out at a gym. Sometimes with Jennifer. Jogging. Showing a passage of time and Frida trying to overcome PMS.
PETER=>You busted me. FRIDA
PETER=>No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
FRIDA=>Intriguing? Someone walks by, walking a dog. The dog barks viciously at Frida, and the dog's owner has a tough time controlling him. Frida looks afraid. Peter's a little weirded out too. The dog's owner finally drags the barking dog away.
FRIDA=>I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
PETER=>At least let me give you this back. I washed it. Just as Peter hands Frida the pillowcase, Mark rides by in his bike. He screeches to a halt, nearly falling off his bike. Mark stares at the pillowcase.
MARK=>What's going on Frida? Peter checks Mark out. Less like a cop than a jealous suitor. Mark looks at Peter like he wants to kill him.
FRIDA=>Where'd you get the bike?
MARK=>I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy? Mark, clearly jealous, looks at Peter, then the pillowcase.
FRIDA=>No, this is Peter. He's a cop. Mark suddenly seems nervous.
MARK=>Oh, hi, uh, Pete. Gotta run Frida. He takes off on his bike. Peter and Frida watch him ride off.
PETER=>Being a cop has such a warm effect on people. FRIDA
PETER=>There's a lot of that going around. She starts walking. Peter walks beside her.
PETER=>You wanna get some coffee?
FRIDA=>I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
PETER=>Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
FRIDA=>No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
PETER=>Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
PETER=>So what book did you buy?
FRIDA=>Oh, it's nothing.
PETER=>No really, I love knowing what people read.
FRIDA=>It's stupid.
PETER=>I can forgive you a bestseller. Frida takes her book out of her bag. It says "The PMS Diet."
PETER=>My mom used to get PMS too.
FRIDA=>Used to? Did it stop finally?
PETER=>No, she died when I was twelve.
FRIDA=>I'm sorry.
PETER=>I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
FRIDA=>Oh my god, by wolves? A chill runs down Frida's spine.
PETER=>We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
FRIDA=>I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
PETER=>The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
FRIDA=>I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
PETER=>Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
FRIDA=>Like what?
PETER=>You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
FRIDA=>A lot of people don't wear underwear. PETER
PETER=>Sorry. Sometimes I'm a bit frank. They keep walking for a few moments.
FRIDA=>How about you? Briefs or boxers?
PETER=>Briefs.
FRIDA=>Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
PETER=>Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
FRIDA=>He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date. They keep walking. CU of Peter and Frida's hands as they accidentally hit a few times as they walk. Peter reaches over and touches her fingers. They hold hands for a moment, then Frida lets go.
FRIDA=>I really gotta get going.
PETER=>Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
FRIDA=>Yeah. Maybe.
PETER=>Goodnight.
FRIDA=>Goodnight. We see the moon and it's nearly full.
FRIDA=>I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
JENNIFER=>Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
FRIDA=>I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
JENNIFER=>Give him the tampon test.
FRIDA=>What the hell is the tampon test?
JENNIFER=>You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out... Jennifer's voice over continues into the next scene.
JENNIFER=>... you search his apartment. Look for drugs in his medicine cabinet, look for pictures of women, look for bank statements. Frida looks at some framed pictures, one of Peter when he was a boy with his mother. Lots of pictures of Peter as a teenager with wolf-looking dogs. She searches some drawers and finds just normal guy stuff. His police badge. His bookshelves are filled with wolf- related books: Virginia Wolf, Thomas Wolfe, The Three Little Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood. His CD collection: Bob Seeger
PETER=>I didn't know what kind to get. He dumps out the bag. He got every make and model of tampon.
PETER=>So I got one of each.
FRIDA=>What are those?
PETER=>Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
FRIDA=>What are they for?
PETER=>Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets. They both eat. Frida takes a sip of wine.
PETER=>So... did you rummage through my stuff while I was gone? He kisses her again.
FRIDA=>What? They kiss between sentences.
PETER=>I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's
FRIDA=>Okay, you busted me. They continue to kiss. Things start getting hot and heavy. Frida lies back on the ground and gently pulls Peter on top of her. They kiss for a moment then Peter pulls away.
FRIDA=>What's wrong?
PETER=>Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
FRIDA=>My period? No. Peter's confused.
PETER=>But... what were those tampons for? Frida remembers now.
FRIDA=>Oh, yes, you're right. I guess I got carried away in the moment. Frida straightens herself up.
PETER=>I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
FRIDA=>No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
PETER=>Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you. Frida has an itch on her arm. She looks at it and in a quick flash, her arm looks incredibly hairy -- then it returns to normal. Frida's freaked out. She puts her arms behind her back. Peter doesn't get what's wrong.
FRIDA=>I have to go. I'm not good at relationships.
FRIDA=>I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
JENNIFER=>You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
FRIDA=>I looked like an Italian man! Jennifer laughs over the phone. Frida's dead serious.
JENNIFER=>How'd it go with the cop?
FRIDA=>We almost slept together... and...
JENNIFER=>Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
FRIDA=>It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
JENNIFER=>Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us. George hears this, shakes his head and motions to Jennifer furiously with his hands, "No, no!" Jennifer shrugs him off.
FRIDA=>Carlton hated me. George glares at Jennifer. She playfully blows him a kiss.
BACK TO FRIDA'S APARTMENT JENNIFER=>No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
FRIDA=>Okay. I guess so.
JENNIFER=>Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
JENNIFER=>Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
GEORGE=>She's just so... pathetic.
JENNIFER=>She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
GEORGE=>She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
FRIDA=>I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
JENNIFER=>Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
FRIDA=>You're just saying that. A couple of CUTE GUYS pass by. Jennifer looks at them, expecting them to comment on her as men usually do. Instead, the guys are checking out Frida. CUTE GUY Hey there beautiful. Frida and Jennifer keep walking.
FRIDA=>What did he say?
JENNIFER=>I think he called you beautiful.
FRIDA=>Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they
CARLTON=>Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
FRIDA=>Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
CARLTON=>Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
GEORGE=>Yeah Jen here's always dieting and eating like a bird. Jennifer is picking at her plate.
CARLTON=>No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
FRIDA=>Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
CARLTON=>Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
JENNIFER=>Charming Carlton.
FRIDA=>It is so hot in here.
FRIDA=>Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
JENNIFER=>I still thought it was a purse.
GEORGE=>You forgot the verb. To bag. "I want to bag her."
FRIDA=>Yeah but does that mean fuck her or kill her? Like a body bag? Frida gulps down her water. Before she has a chance to ask for more, Carlton and George trip over themselves getting the waiter's attention.
CARLTON=>Waiter! She needs more water.
GEORGE=>Can we get some service here? Jennifer takes her cigarette pack out and offers one to George. He takes one as does Jennifer. She puts her cigarette in her mouth and George lights his. Jennifer leans over, expecting George to light her cigarette as well, but he's not paying attention to her, so he blows out his match. Jennifer is not amused. Frida's eyes light up at the smoke.
FRIDA=>I have to go to the bathroom. She bolts up, waving away the smoke. Jennifer follows her.
JENNIFER=>You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
FRIDA=>I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm
JENNIFER=>Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
FRIDA=>No you don't, believe me. Frida looks at her arm.
FRIDA=>Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
JENNIFER=>No they're not. They compare arms.
FRIDA=>Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
JENNIFER=>It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
FRIDA=>I look like fuckin' Chewbacca. A shot of Frida and Jennifer's arms and we don't see much difference in them.
CARLTON=>No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
GEORGE=>Jennifer gave her a make-over.
CARLTON=>Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved? George and Carlton ponder this.
CARLTON=>Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
FRIDA=>I've changed a lot lately. Carlton stops walking. Frida stops as well. Carlton touches Frida's hair. Frida looks at him like she's tempted. She sniffs, then turns away and keeps walking. Carlton walks too. Carlton lights a cigarette. Frida flinches. Her eyes glow.
FRIDA=>You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
CARLTON=>Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
FRIDA=>No.
CARLTON=>James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
FRIDA=>Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
CARLTON=>Yeah but they looked cool... Carlton's voice trails off as he rambles on. Meanwhile Frida is feeling strange symptoms. She's scratching like a dog. She smells something and starts sniffing around. Frida hears snippets of other conversations in various parts of the park: a hold-up, a couple arguing, a couple making out. Frida's head is spinning and she's breathing heavily. She hears Carlton again.
CARLTON=>As James Dean said, "Live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse." ECU of Frida scratching herself with wolfian nails.
FRIDA=>What?
CARLTON=>Your lips look delicious. Frida circles him slowly, staring into his eyes. He's turned on and intrigued. She takes off her jacket, breathing heavily. She zones in closer. Finally she's within reaching distance, and Carlton grabs her waist and pulls her toward him.
CARLTON=>Wow your body's really hot. FRIDA
CARLTON=>I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
FRIDA=>Never felt better. She pulls the cigarette out of his hand and stomps it out. She grabs his face and kisses him passionately. Then she pulls away violently, which sends him spinning for a second. He looks up and she's vanished. All Carlton sees is darkness.
CARLTON=>Frida? Was it something I said?
JENNIFER=>I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
GEORGE=>Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
JENNIFER=>So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
GEORGE=>Well the flake got a lot hotter.
CARLTON=>Frida? Is this some sort of game? Here Frida... Here girl.... He turns around but sees nothing. He takes a few more steps. He hears another growl -- a bit louder and seeming a bit closer. Carlton turns around and seems scared by what he sees. He backpedals quickly away and breaks into a jog. Whatever Carlton sees starts chasing him. We HEAR growling and Carlton looks scared to death. He runs through the park and is chased until he falls down, and we zoom in closer on
FRIDA=>Holy shit, holy shit. She picks up the cordless phone and dials, in a panic.
BACK TO JENNIFER'S APARTMENT=>The phone keeps ringing. Jennifer giggles. George sprays whipped cream on Jennifer.
JENNIFER=>Let it ring. George reaches over to get the phone and picks it up. Jennifer's disappointed that he answered.
GEORGE=>Yeah?
FRIDA=>George, I need to talk to Jennifer. It's an emergency. Out of frame, Jennifer must be doing something to George, cause he starts moaning with pleasure.
FRIDA=>George? Is she there? George hands the phone to Jennifer. Her face is now covered with whipped cream as though she's just had a pie in the face.
GEORGE=>It's for you. Frida.
JENNIFER=>Tell her I'm eating. Jennifer and George laugh. George hands the phone to Jennifer and accidentally drops it in a pile of whipped cream.
JENNIFER=>Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
FRIDA=>There is a man's arm in my bed.
BACK TO JENNIFER'S APARTMENT JENNIFER=>Frida, you are not coyote ugly. Everyone was drooling over you last night. Including George. Jennifer flicks some whipped cream in George's face. He tickles Jennifer, and she nearly drops the phone.
BACK TO FRIDA'S BEDROOM=>Frida circles the bed again.
FRIDA=>Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
JENNIFER=>You fucked Carlton? See I told you
FRIDA=>No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
BACK TO JENNIFER'S BEDROOM=>Jennifer is laughing. George spreads her legs and sprays some whipped cream on her. From Jennifer's POV -- we see George's upper half as he holds her leg up to the side of frame.
FRIDA=>Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
JENNIFER=>Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now. Jennifer hangs up the phone and looks at George.
JENNIFER=>Frida's hallucinating. Her PMS is out of control.
BACK TO FRIDA'S BEDROOM=>Frida runs in wearing rubber gloves and holding a trash bag and a broom. She pokes the arm with the end of the broomstick. Frida wraps the arm in a sheet -- careful to not touch it and obviously grossed out. She opens the trash bag and spreads it out on the floor. With the broom, she pushes the sheet- wrapped arm into the trash bag. MONTAGE of Frida darting around the apartment, searching for places to stick the severed arm.
FRIDA=>Jennifer?
MOTHER=>No it's mom. FRIDA
MOTHER=>We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
FRIDA=>What does that have to do with me?
MOTHER=>You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
FRIDA=>No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
MOTHER=>It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if... Frida glances at the arm in her sink.
FRIDA=>I gotta go. My sink is clogged. Frida hangs up. She inches over to the sink and turns on the garbage disposal. It makes a horrid noise and blood spurts about, but the arm slowly makes its way down the drain.
PETER=>Frida? Frida quickly slams shut the washer and spins around, startled. She turns red and looks guilty.
FRIDA=>Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
PETER=>No. I was doing my laundry.
FRIDA=>I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today. Peter goes to one of the dryers and takes out his clothes. PETER
PETER=>Was there anything in that washer?
FRIDA=>No. Nope, nothing in it. Frida backs up and puts her hand on top of the washer, protecting it.
PETER=>You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
FRIDA=>NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first. Peter backs up, noticing Frida's acting weird. He's a little hurt by her distance.
PETER=>Oh... okay well maybe I lost it somewhere... He goes to his laundry bag. Trying to think of what to say.
PETER=>Hey, I'm sorry if things got a little heavy the other... His beeper rings. He takes a cellular phone out of his pocket and dials.
PETER=>Yeah? Uh huh... What? Torn to bits? Jesus Christ. Okay I'll be right there. He puts the cellular phone back in his pocket.
FRIDA=>Everything okay?
PETER=>A man killed in Central Park. Peter runs out. Frida paces nervously around the laundromat.
FRIDA=>I put it down the garbage disposal.
JENNIFER=>And what makes you think you killed a man?
FRIDA=>Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf! Jennifer stares at Frida.
JENNIFER=>You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
FRIDA=>No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts. Jennifer sits down. She shakes her head.
JENNIFER=>You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
FRIDA=>It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
JENNIFER=>Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
FRIDA=>I haven't gotten it yet.
JENNIFER=>Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
FRIDA=>I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
FRIDA=>I think I'm a werewolf.
SHRINK=>Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf? The shrink makes notes on his pad, "Insane. Delusional."
FRIDA=>I ate a guy last night.
SHRINK=>And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
FRIDA=>I don't know. I don't remember doing it. The shrink sits back in his chair. He thinks for a moment while Frida stares at him. Finally he nods knowingly.
SHRINK=>Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
FRIDA=>We didn't have sex.
SHRINK=>You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
FRIDA=>Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
SHRINK=>You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
GEORGE=>I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS? JENNIFER
GEORGE=>You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
JENNIFER=>Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves. George sneezes.
GEORGE=>Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
JENNIFER=>Take some allergy medicine.
GEORGE=>You can't believe this bullshit.
JENNIFER=>She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her. She hears another "meow" from the carrier.
JENNIFER=>Do we have any tuna?
PETER=>Are you George McCracken? Jennifer looks over.
JENNIFER=>They're police detectives.
GEORGE=>Yeah, I'm George McCracken.
PETER=>We're here about Carlton Fraser. Jennifer freezes.
LLOYD=>Your address was in his pocket.
GEORGE=>Yeah, we were out last night. What happened? Was he in an accident?
PETER=>He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
LLOYD=>And he was missing an arm. Jennifer drops the can opener. Peter looks over. Jennifer picks up the can opener and puts it on the counter.
PETER=>When's the last time you saw Carlton?
GEORGE=>After dinner, he left with Jen's friend, Frida. Peter looks at Jennifer, who looks like she's seen a ghost.
PETER=>Frida Harris? Was she dating him? Peter seems jealous. Lloyd looks suspicious.
JENNIFER=>No, heavens no. They're just... friends. Lloyd looks at Peter. Peter changes the subject quickly.
PETER=>Uh... do you know any enemies Carlton might have? Jennifer and George look at each other, shake their heads, "no."
SPENCER=>Is Frida your real name or just what you tell guys you meet at clubs?
FRIDA=>It's Frida. Frida the FREAK. Spencer and Frida laugh. We hear the rattle of keys.
FRIDA=>Having trouble sticking it in? As the apartment door opens, we see Spencer carrying Frida over the threshold as a groom would his bride. He then flips on the lights of his apartment and kicks the door closed behind him. Spencer is longhaired and sexy. Frida is dressed very seductively and wears a lot of makeup -- but she looks great. She's busty and curvy -- barely recognizable from the frump of the first few scenes. Frida holds her hand up to block the light from her eyes.
FRIDA=>The lights bother my eyes. Can we turn them off?
SPENCER=>But you're so beautiful. I want to look at you. Frida takes a big whiff of Spencer.
FRIDA=>Ummmm... you smell good. Spencer puts Frida down. She immediately starts pacing and circling the apartment, wolflike. She's on the prowl. She's acting different than we've seen her before. Spencer is wearing a Los Lobos T-shirt.
FRIDA=>Are all these your guitars?
SPENCER=>Are those your real breasts? She struts over to him.
FRIDA=>Why don't you decide for yourself. Frida puts his hands on her breasts and gives him a deep,
FRIDA=>You're not too drunk, are you?
JENNIFER=>Frida... pick up the phone...
SPENCER=>It's sexier with the lights on.
FRIDA=>I prefer the darkness. Spencer and Frida start taking off their clothes. Frida turns off the lights before they're completely nude. Behind them, a bit of light comes through the window. We hear them going at it.
SPENCER=>God, your nails are sharp. Frida laughs. Spencer flips on the light as they make out. Frida turns the light off.
FRIDA=>Is this all you have?
SPENCER=>Give it a few min... Oh yeah, nibble on my ear. Spencer flips on the lights again.
SPENCER=>The better to see you with. Frida turns them back off. We hear them going at it again.
SPENCER=>I love it when you bite me. Ouch, shit. Damn, that hurt. Spencer turns the light on. He gets a quick look at Frida -- her eyes glow like wolf eyes. Frida turns the light off.
LLOYD=>I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
PETER=>We only live a few blocks apart.
LLOYD=>This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
PETER=>Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them. Lloyd thinks for a second. He scratches his head.
LLOYD=>She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
PETER=>She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
LLOYD=>Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
PETER=>You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex. Peter and Lloyd walk away. Lloyd glances back at the building.
LLOYD=>How do you know about her psycho ex?
BOY=>Wolf! Wolf! Montage culminates with a low angle shot of Frida's silhouette, with wolflike features, howling in front of a full moon.
FRIDA=>Hello?
JENNIFER=>Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
FRIDA=>I've been here. What day is it?
JENNIFER=>Tuesday. Are you okay?
FRIDA=>Shit, I guess I missed work.
JENNIFER=>Frida, Carlton's dead.
FRIDA=>Oh no.
JENNIFER=>And he was missing an arm.
FRIDA=>Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
JENNIFER=>Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or... There's a knock on the door. Frida whispers into the phone.
FRIDA=>Someone's at my door. Maybe it's
MARK=>Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
FRIDA=>It's Mark.
JENNIFER=>Get rid of him!
FRIDA=>Okay, I gotta go.
JENNIFER=>I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye. Frida hangs up the phone.
MARK=>It's a matter of life and death.
FRIDA=>This really isn't a good time.
MARK=>Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in. He bangs loudly on the door. Frida opens it and he barges in.
MARK=>I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
FRIDA=>So pay them back and apologize.
MARK=>These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
FRIDA=>You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
MARK=>It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
FRIDA=>Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
MARK=>Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
FRIDA=>My bra is my biggest supporter.
MARK=>I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River? Mark looks up at her with his pleading Bambi eyes that Frida always falls for. Mark goes to hug her and kiss her neck. She sniffs him. Then sniffs him again more closely -- like a dog. Mark giggles. Frida doesn't like what she smells.
MARK=>Do I smell? Can I take a shower? He lifts his arms and sniffs his armpits.
FRIDA=>I'm not feeling too well all of the sudden. Go take your shower.
FRIDA=>Mark.
MARK=>Yeah? He comes back into frame. Frida grabs him and kisses him on the mouth. He's taken off guard. She then pushes him away.
MARK=>Wow.
FRIDA=>Take your shower. Mark leaves frame. Frida goes back into the bedroom. She hears Mark singing, muffled from the bathroom. Frida's about to lie back on the bed when Mark's beeper goes off.
JENNIFER=>Shit what happened to you? What's all over you?
FRIDA=>Holy shit, I don't know.
JENNIFER=>Did you get rid of Mark?
FRIDA=>I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
JENNIFER=>He's been here all night?
FRIDA=>Yeah, I guess. Mark? Frida heads for the bathroom and Jennifer follows.
FRIDA=>Oh my god. They inch closer to the bathroom and see Mark lying dead and bloody, holding onto the shower curtain. Blood is all over the white tiles. Frida flinches and spins out of the bathroom and covers her eyes. Jennifer just stares at Mark.
JENNIFER=>Frida, we need to talk. Frida takes a deep breath and peeks back into the bathroom.
FRIDA=>Oh god, did I do that? Jennifer stares at the bloody mess that was Mark.
JENNIFER=>Let's get him into the bathtub. Frida and Jennifer pick up the still bleeding Mark to lug him back into the shower/bathtub.
JENNIFER=>Okay, so tell me again about that werewolf thing...
JENNIFER=>If there's gonna be a bloody mess, at least it's in the bathtub. We'll just hose him off till the blood runs out. Frida and Jennifer look at Mark. He's missing a tooth.
JENNIFER=>What happened to his tooth?
FRIDA=>I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
JENNIFER=>DON'T call the police.
FRIDA=>Why not? There's been a murder.
JENNIFER=>First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
FRIDA=>What? Why'd you do that?
JENNIFER=>There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
FRIDA=>You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you? Jennifer looks over at Mark in the tub.
JENNIFER=>How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
FRIDA=>You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
JENNIFER=>You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
FRIDA=>I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
JENNIFER=>Why the fuck would you do that?
FRIDA=>I could smell another woman on him.
JENNIFER=>If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
FRIDA=>That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
JENNIFER=>Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
LLOYD=>Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
PETER=>The park dude was missing an arm.
LLOYD=>Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
PETER=>Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
LLOYD=>Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
PETER=>She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
JENNIFER=>At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
FRIDA=>You should have seen it erect. They hear the intercom buzzer and stare at each other.
JENNIFER=>You expecting someone?
FRIDA=>No.
JENNIFER=>Ignore it. The buzzer keeps buzzing. Frida goes to the window and looks down to the street. Just as she does, outside, Peter and Lloyd step back from the building and look up at Frida in the window. Peter smiles and waves. Frida forces a smile and waves back. Then she ducks back away from the window.
FRIDA=>Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
JENNIFER=>Tell them you'll meet them outside. Frida goes to the intercom and presses it.
FRIDA=>Uh.... hi!
PETER=>Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
FRIDA=>Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second. She releases the intercom buzzer.
FRIDA=>What the fuck are we going to do?
JENNIFER=>Hide him. Frida and Jennifer both look around the small apartment.
FRIDA=>The refrigerator.
FRIDA=>Go downstairs and stall them. Jennifer goes.
JENNIFER=>Hi guys. What's up? Lloyd is especially happy to see Jennifer.
JENNIFER=>I thought I heard someone coming. She gets back in the elevator and the doors close. She pushes the button for the fourth floor.
JENNIFER=>Oh shit, wrong floor. She pushes the button for the fifth floor. The cops eye her suspiciously. She smiles as the elevator doors close.
JENNIFER=>I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
PETER=>Why would you want to be a cop?
JENNIFER=>I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun. She winks at Lloyd who smiles back at her.
JENNIFER=>Frida? It's us... Jennifer and the nice detectives. Frida takes a last look around, tries to compose herself, and lets them in.
FRIDA=>Hi guys! What's up? Peter, Lloyd and Jennifer walk in. Jennifer looks around, making sure Frida didn't forget anything.
PETER=>We need to ask you a few questions. There's a weird tension between Peter and Frida. He hates having to ask her these questions.
LLOYD=>You heard about Carlton Fraser?
FRIDA=>Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
PETER=>You had a date with Carlton?
FRIDA=>It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
LLOYD=>Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
FRIDA=>What makes you think I was the last one?
PETER=>He means the last that we know of.
LLOYD=>This one walk you home too?
FRIDA=>No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
LLOYD=>You got a dog?
FRIDA=>No, I have a cat.
LLOYD=>How big? Lloyd looks around. He starts coughing -- like he's choking on something.
PETER=>You okay Lloyd? Lloyd tries to nod his head "yes" but keeps coughing.
PETER=>He needs some water. Peter opens the cupboard to get a glass and sees a carton of milk, some cottage cheese, other products that should be in the refrigerator. Lloyd is not facing the cupboard and is in his coughing fit anyway, so he doesn't see this. Peter turns to look at the refrigerator and then looks at Jennifer and Frida. He makes eye-contact with Frida and sees she's afraid. He lets her off the hook and just takes a glass out of the cupboard and closes it as though nothing's wrong. He fills the glass with water from the sink and hands it to Lloyd. Lloyd drinks up and stops his coughing fit.
PETER=>We're considering Mark Wilson a suspect. Frida gulps.
LLOYD=>He's got a record. Drug charges. Avoided jail on pleas. Plus a woman four years ago had a restraining order against him. Frida is genuinely surprised by all this.
JENNIFER=>See he was cheating from the get go.
PETER=>He's been running money for the Mafia.
FRIDA=>No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport. LLOYD
PETER=>Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
LLOYD=>One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
FRIDA=>Am I a suspect? Lloyd looks at Peter.
PETER=>No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
FRIDA=>Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
JENNIFER=>Frida, you have to admit, he is a bit cold at times. And last time you saw him, he was quite torn apart. Jennifer is tempted to laugh. Frida is more serious.
FRIDA=>But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
PETER=>Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it. Frida sees some water leaking from her cupboard. She's increasingly nervous.
LLOYD=>Do you know Spencer Hale? East Village musician? Frida shakes her head no. She looks confused.
FRIDA=>No, why?
PETER=>He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
JENNIFER=>Mark's an East Village musician. He probably knows Spencer.
LLOYD=>Interesting. We'll have to check that out. Peter and Lloyd head for the door.
PETER=>This is probably the strangest case we've ever seen. Frida lets them out. She and Peter exchange a glance. Frida closes the door. She and Jennifer stare at each other.
FRIDA=>Peter knows something.
JENNIFER=>Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
PETER=>Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
LLOYD=>It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
PETER=>It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
LLOYD=>Like a vampire or some shit? Lloyd looks skeptically at Peter.
FRIDA=>Jesus Christ what are we gonna do? We can't bury him around here. Both women pace. JENNIFER
FRIDA=>I think I just got my period.
JENNIFER=>Does that mean this whole thing is over?
FRIDA=>Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
JENNIFER=>Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
FRIDA=>You're such a good friend.
JENNIFER=>So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this. Jennifer gives Frida a hug and heads off the other way.
MR. GRANT=>Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
FRIDA=>No.
MR. GRANT=>No?
FRIDA=>No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
MR. GRANT=>Very well then. Is that all? He continues walking as though nothing's happened. Frida starts packing up her things.
PETER=>Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
FRIDA=>Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
PETER=>I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
FRIDA=>No, I got it. It's okay.
PETER=>What happened? Frida gulps. She's nervous.
FRIDA=>What happened?
PETER=>I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you
FRIDA=>I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
PETER=>Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead. Frida stops walking.
PETER=>Except Mark of course.
FRIDA=>What's that supposed to mean?
PETER=>Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
FRIDA=>No, but thanks for the warning.
PETER=>Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
FRIDA=>Interesting possibility. They're near the subway entrance.
PETER=>Lemme give you a ride. You can't take the subway with that box.
JENNIFER=>Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
FRIDA=>Peter keeps asking me out.
JENNIFER=>Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
FRIDA=>The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
JENNIFER=>We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
PETER=>Frida, wait. I thought you were an animal person. Peter catches up to her.
FRIDA=>I don't know what came over me. They walk for a bit.
FRIDA=>I need to tell you something. It's about... PMS. I get it real bad. Peter laughs.
PETER=>That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days. FRIDA
PETER=>You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
FRIDA=>No, my bite's a lot worse. Peter stops walking. Frida stops as well. Peter caresses the side of Frida's face.
PETER=>Whatever it is, we can work it out. Frida, I love you. Frida's eyes well up. She doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. She ends up laughing.
PETER=>Is it that funny?
FRIDA=>No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
PETER=>Is that how you feel?
FRIDA=>Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
PETER=>You didn't say it.
FRIDA=>I love you too. They kiss.
PETER=>What's with the squirt guns?
FRIDA=>They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
PETER=>You know, I've never seen your cat.
FRIDA=>I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely... Peter takes a squirt gun and squirts Frida. Frida screams playfully. She grabs another squirt gun and fills it. MONTAGE of squirt gun fight. Played just like a "real" police gunfight -- with them creeping through the apartment and ducking behind furniture, trying to get a direct hit on each other. And having a great time. Peter's beeper goes off. He checks it. As he does, Frida squirts him in the face. She cracks up.
FRIDA=>Whatever you do, don't tell me you have to leave. Peter heads for the door.
PETER=>Okay. I won't tell you. She walks him to the door. They kiss. Peter opens the door. From the hallway, we see his POV of Frida as he closes the door and she looks sadly at him. MATCH CUT the closing of the door with the opening of the trunk in the next scene.
LLOYD=>You think mafia hit?
PETER=>Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
LLOYD=>It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
PETER=>Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the
LLOYD=>And fifth, you're dating her. Peter looks shocked.
PETER=>What are you talking about?
LLOYD=>I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
PETER=>What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
LLOYD=>Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
FRIDA=>"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
JENNIFER=>Check out what I found. Jennifer gets a very old-looking book out of her bag.
JENNIFER=>I found it in this out-of-the-way used bookstore. Jennifer opens it up to a page she marked and reads aloud.
JENNIFER=>This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is
FRIDA=>Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
JENNIFER=>"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
FRIDA=>Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
JENNIFER=>She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
FRIDA=>Guess she never found true love.
JENNIFER=>The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
FRIDA=>So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
JENNIFER=>What choice do we have?
FRIDA=>So what do I do?
JENNIFER=>Fall in love.
FRIDA=>I think I already have.
PETER=>Your breasts feel larger.
FRIDA=>They do? Oh no...
PETER=>No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural. Frida sits up.
FRIDA=>I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
PETER=>No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay? Frida nearly flies out of bed, grabbing whatever she can find to cover herself up.
FRIDA=>I... I should just get up. I have lots to do today... Peter stares at her strangely as she darts out of the room.
PETER=>I gotta get downtown. He goes to her to kiss her, but Frida, self-conscious about possible facial hair, bows her head and he ends up kissing the top of it. She recoils and he looks at her, concerned. She won't let him get a good look at her face.
FRIDA=>I have... a lot of... cleaning to do today. She turns around. Peter shrugs. He knows something's wrong. He heads for the door.
PETER=>I'll call you later. Frida nods. Peter leaves. Once he does, Frida rushes to the calendar on the wall and into an ECU of her eye . ECU calendar -- panning past Monday, Tuesday, etc. until we see in red ink "the curse." DOLLY IN/ZOOM OUT of Frida's face, reacting.
FRIDA=>I was just wondering... a person has a choice between killing themselves or killing others, which is worse? I mean you fry in hell either way, right?
PRIEST=>If you kill yourself, you won't be around to ask for forgiveness or to make a last confession, whereas if you kill others, you can go to confession, do penance, and be absolved from your sins.
FRIDA=>But if the person is killing several people, then maybe it's better to kill oneself cause then the killing stops.
PRIEST=>You have a point. Hmmm... I've
FRIDA=>Ugh! I can't even kill myself!! MONTAGE of Frida trying to kill herself. Frida's on the phone with the yellow pages in her lap.
FRIDA=>Yes silver bullets. Do you have any silver bullets? I only need a few. No this is not a joke... Frida hears a dial tone.
JENNIFER=>Frida? You there? Remember, you gave me a key for emergencies? I consider this an emergency. Jennifer uses her key and barges in. She looks around and sees Frida sticking out of the stove.
JENNIFER=>Oh god Frida, don't do it! She pulls her out and Frida has rubber gloves on and is holding a SOS pad.
FRIDA=>I'm cleaning my stove.
JENNIFER=>You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
FRIDA=>I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
JENNIFER=>You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
FRIDA=>I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
JENNIFER=>Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
FRIDA=>But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
JENNIFER=>I guess you'll find out.
FRIDA=>No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
JENNIFER=>No. I won't let you do that.
FRIDA=>The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
JENNIFER=>I think George knows.
FRIDA=>About Mark? Carlton?
JENNIFER=>About Benito.
FRIDA=>Did I kill a guy named Benito?
JENNIFER=>No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with. They're done barricading the window. Jennifer picks up some more wood and nails.
FRIDA=>I thought you and George were getting married.
JENNIFER=>We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
FRIDA=>I wish I only had your problems.
JENNIFER=>Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
FRIDA=>Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over. Jennifer hands Frida the wood and nails.
JENNIFER=>Okay, just nail shut this door behind me. I'll call you later. Frida looks worried.
FRIDA=>I don't deserve a friend like you.
JENNIFER=>Yes you do. Jennifer smiles and leaves. After she closes the door, Frida immediately starts nailing boards across the door to shut herself in.
FRIDA=>Hello?
PETER=>Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
FRIDA=>NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
PETER=>What? Is there someone else? Frida hesitates for a moment.
FRIDA=>Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
PETER=>Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
BACK TO FRIDA'S APARTMENT=>Long pause as they each try to think of something to say.
PETER=>You at least owe me the truth.
FRIDA=>You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
PETER=>Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
FRIDA=>No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
BACK TO PETER'S OFFICE=>Peter shakes his head.
PETER=>If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
FRIDA=>I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away! Peter hears a hang up. He puts the phone down and stares at it sadly for a moment.
PETER=>Hey Lloyd. Lloyd stops and comes in the office.
LLOYD=>My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
PETER=>What makes her think that?
LLOYD=>She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder. Something clicks with Peter. He flips through a calendar.
PETER=>So... they're on some cycle. The
LLOYD=>And that was 28 days ago today.
PETER=>Did we get those DNA tests back?
LLOYD=>Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
PETER=>What kind of animal?
LLOYD=>Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
FRIDA=>Go away. I might hurt you.
PETER=>I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
FRIDA=>Peter I love you too but...
PETER=>I don't think you'll hurt me. Frida, still gnawing at the beef, circles him slowly. He's
FRIDA=>How do you know?
PETER=>I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
FRIDA=>I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
PETER=>I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better? There is a long pause.
FRIDA=>A little. Peter sets the gun on the table. He takes a few steps closer. Frida backs up.
FRIDA=>Be careful!
PETER=>Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
FRIDA=>No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
PETER=>I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me. He steps closer again and now Frida's backed up against the wall. He can see her eyes look strangely wolf-like. He's afraid but inches closer. Frida tries to inch away. It's almost like a dance. Finally they find their way to each other and embrace -- the side of beef between them.
FRIDA=>Promise to shoot me if I attack you. Peter closes his eyes and nods. Frida sniffs the side of beef hungrily.
FRIDA=>Can you order up some chocolate? Peter smiles.
PETER=>I knew you wouldn't kill me.
FRIDA=>Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
PETER=>We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
FRIDA=>Worse than this?
PETER=>Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
FRIDA=>What about... those guys... I might have...
PETER=>No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No
FRIDA=>I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
PETER=>I know. The important thing is that it stop. Frida nods as she digs into her steak.
JENNIFER=>Truce? George pulls out a can of Readi-Whip from his bag.
GEORGE=>Truce. George sneezes.
PETER=>I'm going to take a shower.
FRIDA=>Okay. He starts to walk out. Frida continues with her steak.
FRIDA=>Peter? Peter stops at the door and turns around.
FRIDA=>Thanks. For everything. Peter smiles and continues out of the room.
FRIDA=>Hello?
JENNIFER=>Frida? You okay?
FRIDA=>Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
JENNIFER=>Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
FRIDA=>God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
JENNIFER=>Sure. See ya.
JENNIFER=>In the shower? She looks worried.
FRIDA=>Peter? Peter? Dolly in close on his face. Behind him, through the shower curtain, we see the blurry figure of Frida. Peter's a bit worried for a moment too. He pulls back the curtain so he can see her. She's standing there holding a towel.
FRIDA=>Here's a towel.
PETER=>Thanks. The tension is broken. Peter's completely relieved. Frida hangs the towel on the towel rack and leaves. Peter goes back to soaping himself up.
PETER=>Hey Frida? Frida comes back into the bathroom.
PETER=>Wanna join me? Frida beams. She tosses off her robe and gets in the shower. Frida and Peter kiss and suds each other up.
PETER=>Want me to do your back? Frida turns around. Peter starts scrubbing her back. Frida appears to be enjoying it -- though we can't see her face because she has her head down.
PETER=>Doesn't this feel great? Frida nodes her head. She lifts it and we see her face. Her eyes are glowing. She smiles and we see fangs. Freeze frame on CU of her eyes.
