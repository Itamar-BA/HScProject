WENDY AND CAMPERS=>"Aye-aye-aye-aye, in China they never grow chilly, So sing me another verse that's worse than the first and make sure it's foolish and silly..."
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Rightly or wrongly, for better or worse, the counselors defined themselves quickly. No one more so than Wendy. First week of camp, the perky girl who knows all the rules and all the songs is pretty much Queen.
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Wendy's monarchy of relentlessly daisy-fresh enthusiasm could not possibly last. Or could it?
NASTY CAMPER GIRL=>This camp sucks shit! A good counselor is supposed to know when we eat and where are the horses and why--Fu-- uck!
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Donald Dark liked to think of himself as a witty, intelligent young man trapped in a geek's body.
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Unfortunately, and Donald Dark had known this for years, a witty, intelligent young man in a geek's body is still a geek.
DONALD=>I had a sleepwalker at my last camp. Important thing's not to panic...so anyway, like I was saying, once the ] campers found out my full name was ] Donald Dark, their brilliant minds ] led them to call me Donald Dark Duck, ] which turned into Daffy, for Daffy ] Duck is indeed a dark duck. Then ] my name became Retarded Marshmallow ] Head. Don't ask... ] MALE COUNSELOR ] I won't. Listen man, I'm sure this ] summer will be a lot different... ] A group of smiling male campers are revealed to be sinisterly ] huddled at a window behind them. ] EAVESDROPPING MALE CAMPER ] "Retarded Marshmallow Head." I like ] it. I like it a lot. ]
TALIA=>You look a like you could use a friend. You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
WENDY=>Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up! Isn't Fun great!
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Talia liked kids. In theory. Talia liked nature. In pictures. Talia was city-cigarette-cynicism temporarily located 72 miles outside of Portland for one reason: Him.
TALIA=>College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
WICHITA=>Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
ADAM=>What's wrong with you little vaginas? Weak! Next!
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Adam needed little elaboration. As a child, he tasted the whip. Now, after years of waiting, it was Adam's turn to crack it.
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Like any good fascist, Adam truly believed his brand of counseling was not sinister, but rather for the camper's own good.
WICHITA=>Cinnamon or spearmint or both?
WICHITA=>Go stand by the flagpole.
JASPER=>Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
WICHITA=>When all else fails, Jasper--Gum. Even now in these troubled times, ] every child's drug of choice. ]
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Jasper was seemingly shy, but actually sly. A lot more than met the eye.
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Jasper was the sensitive counselor, the one the campers seeked out to discuss the biggies. He had an uncanny ability to notice pain and get it in the open. "In the open" was Jasper's favorite place to be.
DONALD=>I mean, how far could she have..
JASPER=>I'm gay. I could tell people were getting this "sexually confused" vibe from me. I'm not. I'm straight- up fairy...but don't freak out, I'm not attracted to either of you...
DONALD=>Well. Gay. Gay's great. I mean, I'm not, you know, but hey, if you, I mean--
SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BOY=>She touched me! She touched me!
WICHITA=>Meet Todd! From our cabin!
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>The gung-ho cute counselor...The hard-ass control freak...the sensitive gay counselor...and then there were those who could not be glibly categorized. To name one...Pixel.
PIXEL=>Come on, this isn't the hokey-pokey, a-che the body...that's it...Let's hear some noise out there! The ladies dance for tips and tips only!
PIXEL=>No, no, not one arm at a time, grab the bottom of the shirt with both hands, that's it. Feel the heat...
LOOKOUT GIRL=>Wendy!
CAMPERS=>A movie...two words...first word...sounds like...
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Pixel gleefully answered all the dirty questions a good counselor would uncomfortably ignore. It was dangerous to try and figure Pixel out. She herself wisely never tried. Others would.
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>As strange as Pixel may have seemed, the camp's real wild card was Wichita.
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Here was a someone who did not care about workbookleted activities. Here was someone who had anarchy in his eyes. Here was someone. Period. He played it low-key that first week...
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>No one could see into Wichita's soul, but at least it was clear that he had one. He had an effect on everyone, even those thought to have no feelings...
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>A collection of individuals separated from regular society eventually becomes something more than a collection of individuals separated from regular society. It becomes one mammoth living organism. Different traits of different people feeding off and flowing into each other--the naive and the perverse, the brutal and the sweet, the overconfident and the overwhelmed-- all coming together to form one singularly special whole.
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>An organism made up of 70 screaming kids counseled by young adults at the most fucked-up point in their lives is a monster well worth a glance. Welcome to Camp Bleeding Squaw.
OBERON=>Campers, welcome to Camp Bleeding Squaw! I'm Big Chief Oberon. Fun. I like it. You think I don't? I do. But Fun without structure is chaos and chaos is not fun--Now everybody rip off their band-aid!
OBERON=>Yes! It has begun! I declare war! Color War!--all the way to our Fortieth Day! Welcome to the thrill of competition and the joy of making others cry. I want Reds here, Greens there, Blue across from them and the Purple team against the flagpole!
OBERON=>This new turn of events brings up an interesting question: Who's got more Camp pride?
DONALD=>Something tells me he can't hear us.
OBERON=>I can't he--ar you!
WICHITA=>Not bad, Donald Dark.
OBERON=>One more time!
WENDY=>Red! Red! Whoopsy.
OBERON=>Haven't you people ever seen an epileptic camper before?-- Counselors, get these Injuns into the cabins and then onto the Activities! Fun! Now! Move it!
OBERON=>But even more than the taste of S'mores, he enjoyed the taste of camper flesh.
THE CAMPERS=>Ooooh!
WENDY=>Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
TALIA=>We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
DONALD=>I'm having "Billy" problems again. He turned today's food fight into a fork fight.
ADAM=>You have no authority. To get camper respect, you must...
WENDY=>Instead of getting all mad at Donald's Tasmanian Devil Billy, have you people ever thought of getting all glad at him-- making him feel a part of things. The workbooklet says...
WICHITA=>Don't mean to interrupt, Wendy dear, but isn't that the little buckaroo eating a sandwich of communion hosts...
TALIA=>Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
WENDY=>Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
TALIA=>Yes, it does.
PIXEL=>The workbooklet says this is a summer camp, not a concentration one, you homophobic Nazi cunt.
OBERON=>...and on Parent's Day, the campers rushed from their cabins to see the corpses of their slaughtered parents nailed to the picnic tables...
THE CAMPERS=>Oooh.
WENDY=>Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
DONALD=>Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
WICHITA=>Wendy, I think as a counselor, you suck.
WENDY=>What did you...
ADAM=>That's cold, man.
WICHITA=>Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
PIXEL=>Ugh, is anybody paying attention to what Big Chief Oberon is saying...
OBERON=>And as the stench of complete and utter death rose above the camp, the birdies began to choke and drop from the...
WENDY=>He-ey, what happened to the fire while I was gone? I think we need some kindling, campers, and pronto!
WICHITA=>What in the hell did you do that for?
WENDY=>I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
WICHITA=>That's not what I was worried about.
TALIA=>Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
PIXEL=>You and Wichita go to school together, right? Have you two ever...
TALIA=>That would be a No.
PIXEL=>That wants to be a Yes.
TALIA=>I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
PIXEL=>Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
TALIA=>Am-ber! Uh...don't do that.
PIXEL=>"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
TALIA=>Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
TALIA=>...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
WICHITA=>Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
TALIA=>"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
WICHITA=>Talia, you're a wonderful person...
TALIA=>Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness. Under the stars. I've ruined every--
WICHITA=>I just never thought of you in that...
TALIA=>I gotta...I gotta go do a "bunk check." Or some fucking thing.
WICHITA=>I'm sorry, honey, I completely forgot why you're crying...
SOBBING GIRL=>Because BLUBBERING GIBBERISH.
WICHITA=>Uh, I see. Gum?
ADAM=>Can't you just give her a violent ugly fuck so she won't bother you anymore...
WICHITA=>Talia is one of my best friends, Adam, but you know, thanks for voting...
ADAM=>Talk about flipping the script. That creepy, bitchy waif in actuality is a hot, sexy, little piece of...
OBERON=>Rise! Shine! Now! Are you ready for Week 2? The timetables are going to get tighter and the war is going to get tougher. At Camp Bleeding Squaw, Immaturity is not an option. Mess Hall. Nine minutes. Move it!
OBERON=>How, campers...
EVERYONE=>How, Big Chief Oberon...
OBERON=>Better. You're getting better. Inspection results. Cabin Four. Dead fly. 24 hour Playstation confiscation.
OBERON=>And it looks like Cabin One has a bedwetter. I don't want to embarrass anyone but his initials are Ted Jackson.
OBERON=>Thank you, Wendy. Listen up! Red and blue teams will report to the archery range for...
WICHITA BOY ONE=>Dude, how many times have you had sex with your mother?
WICHITA BOY TWO=>Gee, lots of times. Nothing beats having sex with your own Mom. Right, Todd?
TODD=>Uh, I don't...I never..I never had sex with...Never.
OBERON=>Okay injuns, our next event is...
WICHITA=>"has been canceled!" Finally your first hour of free time! I don't know about you, but I'm hitting the beach!
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>59 minutes of free time. It seemed like such a small concession, yet it was the official end of one summer camp and the beginning of another.
OBERON=>Coed camps--Anarchy by definition. I mean, look at these twitching heinies...If you stop channeling this sick energy, even for a second, the fluids build up, the generators start to rumble and...
ADAM=>Sir, I think we have a bigger problem with Jasper at the end of the pier. Rhymes with "Big Homo."
ERIC=>Ooh--Cabin 3 babes turning over...
WICHITA=>Take a picture, it lasts longer.
ALL-AMERICAN RYAN=>Good idea, Wichita.
WICHITA=>Um, that was my way of saying it's not cool to sta-are...
WENDY=>I love this song!
WICHITA=>I hate this song.
SMOOTH NARRATOR=>Some liked the cookouts, some liked the water sports, but the one activity everyone had an interest in was watching the attractive and attracted opposites of Rulemaker Wendy and Rulebreaker Wichita. They were becoming the heart of the organism, pumping blood to its every pore.
DONALD=>But camp has only really just begun...
DONALD=>Haven't you seen movies where the beautiful girl realizes--"Hey, maybe I don't have to be with the most foxy hunk in the world, you know, maybe that nice, caring guy, the one the others sometimes call "nerd"-- Maybe he's the one who--"
DON'T TOUCH ME TODD=>You touched me! You touched me!
OBERON=>What kind of nauseous fucky-fuck ritual is this?
OBERON=>Wichita...I should have known this was going to happen! Et tu, Wendy? And look at all of you, the giddy witnesses! I command a complete camp lockdown until dawn! No one is to leave their cabin and no one is to say one word about this incident or the entire subject of sexuality until I can concoct proper punishment! Move it!
RYAN, THE ALL-AMERICAN BOY=>Hey, how long do we have to keep up this queasy massage shit?
ERIC=>Man, didn't you listen to Wichita? If you ever want to be with a girl, instead of just talking about it, Massage ability is key.
STANLEY, ERIC'S SHORT PAL=>This sucks.
ERIC=>Thanks, I know. Wichita says that everyone cool knows that "sucks" is a good word now.
RYAN, THE ALL-AMERICAN BOY=>All right, all right--just because you're Wichita's favorite, doesn't mean you have to be such a drag.
HAYLEY=>That's Bullshit. I think.
WICHITA=>Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
DONALD=>Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
WICHITA=>Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
DONALD=>I'm not really a--Does it count if...
ADAM=>You either have or you haven't. It's pass/fail, Daffy.
BIG DRUNKEN STONER LUG=>It's okay, Donald Dark dude, I'm waiting until I find the right girl, myself...
ADAM=>"The right girl?" I thought we were talking about sex. Pardon my French, the right girl means one avec a pussy. Guys are different. You know how a girl feels like a whore if the guy's only in it for the poon. What women fail to understand is that a man feels equally ashamed if the relationship is based on just talking and sharing feelings.
DONALD=>Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
WICHITA=>They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
PIXEL=>You know what da problem with women is? They're all bitches.
THE OTHER GIRLS=>Fu-uck yes...
TALIA=>You know what I hate; a woman says yes to going out to dinner wich-you, right? Orders chips and salsa and appetizers and shit. Then on the way home when you whip it out, she gets all...
AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPER-COUNSELOR=>I like big-ass titties!
TALIA=>Man, why you dissin' me with your non-sequitur bullshit.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPER-COUNSELOR=>Sorry G. Now I ain't going down on no woman. Belly button low as I go.
PIXEL=>But dude, dude, dude, the babes go crazy for dat shit. Especially when you're just wiggling your tongue all around, having no idea what you're doing, without a single clue about a woman's body...
TALIA=>Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
WENDY=>I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPER-COUNSELOR=>Wendy, men aren't that disgusting!
DONALD=>That was one of the five great shits of my life. You know, when you start off with incredible resistance, then pow, two, neat packages that you barely have to wipe. I need a hug.
BIG STONER LUG=>Man, I had a Grande yesterday. I didn't know whether to flush it or put it through college.
JASPER=>Oh God...that's it? I'm "the gay guy." Every time I walk into a room, everyone is going to...
ADAM=>Hey, nobody asked you to be a homosexual. You can't complain about being treated gay when you are gay. While we're on the subject, do you have your Camp physical results?
JASPER=>The only toxic asshole in this cabin is you...Wichita, Wichita, why are you hanging around with us clowns, when you know you how badly Wendy wants to be your wonderwall...
BIG DRUNKEN STONER LOG=>The gay guy--I mean, Jasper's right. You and Wendy bring out the romantic in all of us.
WICHITA=>Gee guy, coming from you, that's..disturbing. Wendy and I...come on. I believe in nothing. She believes in everything. I listen to Reznor, she listens to Barney. I watch...
DONALD=>Man, you're doth protesting way too much. Admit you want her.
ADAM=>In case you haven't noticed, the entire camp is in quarantine because of you two. Now instead of slipping in a frog...
WICHITA=>Listen you Vikings, Wendy's still very young and inexperienced and I have to respect...
ADAM=>If no one had sex with a girl because she was a virgin--you know where I'm going with this.
JASPER=>You are to be executed at Dawn anyway. Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
WICHITA=>You're all making me blush...
WENDY=>Me and Wichita? Don't be ridiculous. That guy thinks he's so "alternative" with all his brooding and his...He's hardly uninteresting, but...
AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPER-COUNSELOR=>Oh Wendy, the transparent bickering, the lingering glances...
PIXEL=>Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
WENDY=>I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
WICHITA=>Eavesdropping, eh? Hear anything good?
ERIC=>Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
ADAM=>Eric. You ever have a woman's pussy wrapped completely around your head?
ERIC=>Uh...no.
ADAM=>What were you, a butthole baby!
WICHITA=>Eric, if you ever find yourself evolving into that, please jump off the Fremont Bridge. Now get to bed-- all you boys.
WENDY=>Hey.
WICHITA=>Hey--that coffee? You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
WENDY=>Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
WICHITA=>Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
WENDY=>We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
WICHITA=>Yes you do.
WENDY=>Yeah. I guess I do.
WICHITA=>Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
WENDY=>Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
WICHITA=>I think your passion is terrific.
WENDY=>I think your condescension is even better.
WICHITA=>We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
WENDY=>Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
WICHITA=>You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
WENDY=>Do you really not believe in God?
WICHITA=>It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
WENDY=>What else don't you believe in?
WICHITA=>Talking while kissing.
WICHITA=>So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
WENDY=>Iunno.
WICHITA=>"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
WENDY=>Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I almost did something.
OBERON=>I'm not against the occasional camp romance, but...I can feel it...Nocturnal Activities. Little rapists and their little whores...Who goes there?
WENDY=>Rise and Shine, campers and counselors. Today, unhappiness is not an option. Mess Hall. Nine minutes. Please.
OBERON NARRATION=>After the trauma of having her first significant sexual experience interrupted by her camp director's electrocution, Wendy threw herself into her work and my work.
OBERON NARRATION=>The would-be lovers were in pain. Their cabinmates were not much help...
WENDY=>What are you doing?
PIXEL=>Nothing.
WENDY=>You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
PIXEL=>When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority? Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
WENDY=>Geez, what time is it? I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is. I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
PIXEL=>I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
WENDY=>Why do you even like me?
PIXEL=>You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
WENDY=>I'm not a nai-ive little...
PIXEL=>Uh-huh.
MUTTERING GIRL=>I-lost-my-barrette. One-time-I-lost- a-magnetic-puzzle-piece-We-thought- my-little-brother-ate-it.
PIXEL=>On that note, my morning swim...
MUTTERING GIRL=>We-had-to-go-through-his-poop-with- a-kitchen-knife-for-a-week. My- favorite-food-is...
JASPER=>No, they're not from Wendy.
WICHITA=>Your Secret admirer?
JASPER=>Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
JASPER=>I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
WICHITA=>Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
JASPER=>Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
WICHITA=>Hey, it's not a crush anymore if ] you actually say it to the person ] you supposedly have the... ] JASPER ] Thought I'd get points for a post- ] modern approach to coming on to you. ]
WICHITA=>Goodnight, Jasper.
JASPER=>Goodnight.
WENDY=>Hey campers, give me a morning YEE- HO!
THE CAMPERS=>Yee-Ho.
OBERON NARRATION=>At even the best camps, the fear and excitement of the opening weeks gives way to dull routine, but after finding and losing the thrill of romance, the organism that was Camp Bleeding Squaw seem to wither and die faster than usual.
WENDY=>Hey campers, how about a morning YEE-HO!
CAMPERS=>Yee....Ho.
WENDY=>Hey campers, I think it's time for a morning YEE-HO!
CAMPERS=>yeeho.
ERIC=>That was a bummer, Stanley--your parents not coming to parents day-- you all right?
ERIC FRIEND STANLEY=>Yeah, I'm fine. My Mom had to work. I'm fine.
WICHITA=>That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
ERIC=>Oh thanks, it was nothing...
WICHITA=>You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
ERIC=>Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
WENDY=>Isn't Fun great? It's the first day of last half of camp, so let's start with the biggest YEE-HO yet. YEE- HO!
WENDY=>Boy oh boy and girl oh girl, looks like I'm going to have to tug out my super-secret summer weapon! I think I have two words that will turn some of those frowns upside down.
DONALD=>Please God, don't let one of those words be "Scavenger."
WENDY=>"Scavenger Hunt!" Is it getting awesome in here or is it just me! Counselors, pass out the lists!
WICHITA=>When were you in Niagara Falls?
WENDY=>About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
ADAM=>Uh, we got off to a bad start, me and you. I'll bet there's a lot of things you don't know about me.
PIXEL=>Believe me, I wish I knew less. Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
ADAM=>I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
TODD=>Guess what, guys? I didn't want to come out and say anything the other day, but you know, I've had sex with my mother, too...
STANLEY=>He fell for it! What a perverted idiot!
DONALD=>Oh, I don't know...I can't imagine....
WICHITA=>Start imagining. Watch me, you have to Novocain your body like this...And your shirt--In or out, man?
WICHITA=>Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession... Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
DONALD=>It is? I don't know about this, Wichita. Am I even right for Talia? ] What About Wendy? I mean, you and ] Wendy--how are you and Wendy... ] WICHITA ] Complicated. Extremely. ] Wichita and Donald drift closer toward the head-setted Wendy, ] who stands to the side of the searchers like a commandant. ] WENDY ] Now remember, people, let's keep ] away from the mountain. Repeat... ] ] There you are. Could you possibly ] do one thing and help keep the ] campers away from.... ] WICHITA ] ] Hey everybody, we're climbing the ] mountain! ]
WENDY=>Don't get angry, count to ten, count to..one, two, three--Will you people please stop dropping your scavenger sheets and retrieval sacks!
HAYLEY=>Man, she's losing it...
TALIA=>It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
WENDY=>Okay, okay, this sure was exciting, but it's time to go back...time to...What do we all say to a Marco Polo tournament!
WENDY=>One, two, three--whore!
WENDY=>Come back, I didn't mean to... ] Don't look at me like that. Counseling tips from you of all people...Jennifer said you taught her how to "activate her clitoris."
PIXEL=>And?
WENDY=>"And?" There's no "And!"
WENDY=>Now what? What did I do this time?
DONALD=>I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
DONALD=>What about that?
WENDY=>You're nifty, Donald. Really. Hey, I noticed you talking to Talia in the cafeteria. You should make a move.
ADORING FEMALE CAMPER=>Smoking is cool.
PIXEL=>Yes. It is.
ADORING FEMALE CAMPER=>Can I have a drag?
PIXEL=>You're not pregnant are you?
ADORING FEMALE CAMPER=>No-o.
DONALD=>Talia. How's it going?
CAMPER BOY=>I got stung by a bee!
WENDY=>Oh, that's terrible. I know how you must feel...
CAMPER BOY=>No, you don't.
WENDY=>You're right, I don't. My God, I have no idea what you feel like...
WENDY=>All this time talking down to the kids, talking around the kids. No more! No distance between me and the campers, me and the pain. Yes, yes, the pain is the key!
DONALD=>All in all, I'd rather be in India. I find their culture to be so...
TALIA=>Oh my, you're making your big move, aren't you, Retarded Marshmallow Head? And you've been coached by the best. I mean, of course, let's pair off the two geeks! How convenient for everyone. Talia can't possibly have any standards! All of you can go to hell!
HAYLEY=>Talia, don't go!
TALIA=>Wha-at? What is it?
HAYLEY=>Everything.
WENDY=>It took something as simple as a bee sting to remind me that a part of myself will always be a camper. You have to be hurt in order to heal! Today is the first day I can truly call myself Counselor!
OBERON NARRATION=>Much like a little boy who throws sand at the girl in the sandbox because he likes her, Wichita had helped turn the mountain into a rumbling volcano that had almost given Wendy a nervous breakdown. A good time was had, but it was now time to move on. To start to take responsibility. To deal with the implications of the photograph on Wendy's wall...
WENDY=>You know I think I forgot to remember that I'm allergic to bee stings.
TALIA=>Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
HAYLEY=>I hope so...
TALIA=>This is...this is...a very special moment...
WICHITA=>Howdy Pouty.
DONALD=>I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
WICHITA=>She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club. Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
DONALD=>You are the prince of the darkness.
DONALD=>The funny thing about this Talia thing is I wasn't even really that...The person I really like-- I probably shouldn't be admitting this...
WICHITA=>I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
DONALD=>Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
WICHITA=>I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right? Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right? I have to see her...
DONALD=>Say Hi for me.
DONALD=>What is it, Cosmo?
COSMO, THE DONALDISH CAMPER=>I don't know...this girl...gave me this note...she wants to meet by the creek tonight...I don't know.
DONALD=>Camp Eberhardt. Anne Wilson, lovely Anne Wilson. She was the only camper to have a lifeguard's license so she was the only one allowed to take out a canoe without supervision. She asked me to come with her for a post-bonfire spin around the lake and I said no. I was young, I was nervous, I didn't really like canoes-- I said no. If I would have gone on that canoe, I'd be a different person, I know it. Successful, happy, assertive. I'd be a nearsighted Wichita. You think you're a kid so your decisions don't matter now. They do. They all do.
COSMO, THE DONALDISH CAMPER=>Okay, okay, I'll go to the dumb lake. But only if you do "Retard goes to ] the Movies." ] The other campers, joyfully rabid, encircle Donald. ] CLAMORING KID ] Yeah, Retarded Marshmallow Head, ] Do the retard! ] DONALD ] It's not very nice to make fun of ] the mentally handicapped... ] COSMO ] Yeah, but it makes us laugh... ] Donald immediately contorts himself into a Carreyesque/Sling ] Blade slouch and lurches about the cabin to camper guffaws. ] DONALD ] I lack to gowuh to duh movies becuz ] my Uncle Playdohhead buys me duh ] Dunior mints if I do duh Dunior mint ] dance! ]
WENDY=>I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
WICHITA=>You're seriously wonderful.
WENDY=>Hey...You have to get out of here. I'm...having a bad face day. Don't look at me... ] Jasper told me what you did. Carrying ] me down the mountain as fast as you ] could... ] WICHITA ] Only dropped you twice... ]
WENDY=>Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
WENDY=>Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
WICHITA=>Exactly.
WICHITA=>Todd was out there blocking the ] entrance. You would have been proud ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
WENDY=>And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
WICHITA=>I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way ] of thinking, we could really do some ] great counseling. It's all about ] the evolution of the species, we ] can improve... ]
WENDY=>I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
WICHITA=>I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
WENDY=>Don't worry, you...
WICHITA=>God, you're beautiful.
WENDY=>Fuck off.
WICHITA=>I should leave. You probably need your rest.
WENDY=>Probably.
TALIA=>Freeze! You're busted!
HAYLEY=>What are you gonna do about it?
TALIA=>Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope? Where you going? I don't want to know.
HAYLEY=>Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
TALIA=>Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor. ] Don't get caught. I'll deny ] everything. ]
VOYEUR BOY ONE=>Whoa--I don't get why people protest pornography. They must not have seen this issue.
VOYEUR BOY ONE=>I'm in love with love.
WENDY=>Oh, they're so cute...
WICHITA=>Was I ever that young...?
WICHITA=>I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with. The swelling is gonna go down, right?
WENDY=>Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
WICHITA=>It's been known to happen.
BEDWETTER TED=>Oh my god...intercourse.
HAYLEY=>No way...Move over, Ted.
ERIC=>Hey, let us impressionable minds have a turn...
ADAM=>It's called "Pink waffle"--perhaps before your time--Brillo pad scraped against the skin popping out from a pressed down tennis racquet. Okay, that's enough! I'm only kidding. More.
PIXEL=>Sadist! I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline? You're a monster. That kid is going to be traumatized for...
ADAM=>About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
PIXEL=>No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
ADAM=>Why are you...don't stop...why?
PIXEL=>"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
OBERON NARRATION=>Sex, of course. Don't worry, only four people were actually having it. But...
OBERON NARRATION=>the whole idea of it, the scent of it, seemed to insinuate itself into everything like a lush fog...and a grotesque oil spill.
WICHITA=>Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
WENDY=>Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
OBERON NARRATION=>As always, everything revolved around Wendy and Wichita. They were the plant on the classroom windowsill, fed and watered by enthusiastic teachers and children.
OBERON NARRATION=>It's so much fun to watch it grow and grow...but these classroom plants always have a way of getting too big...beyond control...
WENDY=>Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
WICHITA=>Do you really think I care?
WICHITA=>She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
WENDY=>Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week. My mom says it's okay that I stay overnight at your dorm...It'll be nice to see you in ] a different shirt. ] WICHITA ] Oh, I didn't tell you. I wear this ] all year round. The chicks dig it... ]
WENDY=>It's going to be strange. Having to plan "dates" and.... Something wrong? What's up?
OBERON NARRATION=>Oh, I almost forgot about Talia. She did the most shocking thing of all: She became a camp counselor.
WENDY=>Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
WICHITA=>Not now, Wendy.
WENDY=>This isn't about "doing it." I just think we need to talk some things out privately before...
WICHITA=>Does this camp suck or does this camp suck?
THE CAMPERS=>This camp sucks!
WICHITA=>They tried to tame us...They forced us to make their bead necklaces and run their sack races, but we rebelled! We made our own camp!
WICHITA=>You're good. Oh God, look at Jerry Rice over there.
JASPER=>You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody. I know ] you like to think of yourself as ] the Anti-Oberon, but man, you're ] getting just as spooky. What was ] that speech in there? Does Camp really ] have to be a revolutionary act? Can't ] the children, at their own pace, ] discover... ] WICHITA ] Yeah, okay, I was a little out of ] hand, but come on, you got to give me Todd. Don't get me wrong, I've learned to love the little Piggy, but Todd is the most invincible loser I've ever come across. His greatest talent is lack thereof. No matter ] what the category, bet against him ] and win. ]
JASPER=>Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
WICHITA=>Hello?! What's in it for me?
JASPER=>Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything. Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
WICHITA=>Sorry Jasper, this handshake is as hot as it's going to get.
JASPER=>Go back for a pass, Todd. I know you can catch it, buddy.
TODD=>Sure, Jasper.
WICHITA=>Todd. Don't drop it.
TODD=>Ooh--Almost!
JASPER=>Yeah, "almost," you fat fuck.
PIXEL=>You want to know if Wichita's love is true. I can think of nothing less silly. I approach Wichita at the beach, tell him he needs to go to the woods...
WENDY=>It'll never work...
PIXEL=>You'll be hiding behind a tree.
WENDY=>The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
PIXEL=>Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down. Either way, you come away with knowledge.
PIXEL=>Wichita--the Thomas Twins are missing. Somebody said they saw them run into the forest. Can you help me?
PIXEL=>Hmmm...I wonder where those two rascals could be...
PIXEL=>Now that were in the middle of nowhere, aren't you a little curious to know what it'd be like to...
TALIA=>Tracy, can you hear me? Okay good, that's it, that's right, cough it out. We're going to the infirmary, honey...
PIXEL=>Talia, get away from her, I told you, Hayley's my favorite--
TALIA=>Mine!
HAYLEY=>You guys have been so colossal...
PIXEL=>Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
TALIA=>Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
PIXEL=>They're the easiest to shoplift, okay? No woman should have to pay for something forced-on-her-without- choice by Nature...what's the matter, Hayley? ] As they playfully bicker, Hayley gazes, with a tinge of ] longing, to Vanessa and the Bombshellettes parked at a picnic ] table, flirting up a storm with their cute-boy-counterparts. ] TALIA ] What do you think--it's the Last ] Night of Camp Dance. ] PIXEL ] What are you saying? She doesn't need ] some boy to validate her summer ] experience! ] TALIA ] Oh of course she does, you dumb ] bitch. Just because we're feminist, ] doesn't mean we have to be totally ] abnormal. ] PIXEL ] Hayley back me up... ] HAYLEY ] ] One dance would be kind of ] nice...Don't hate me, Pixel. ] PIXEL ] ] I don't. Now go away, Talia and I ] need to huddle... ]
DANCING FEMALE CAMPER ONE=>Why did you wait--
DANCING MALE CAMPER ONE=>until the last day of camp--
DANCING FEMALE CAMPER TWO=>to tell me that you--
DANCING MALE CAMPER TWO=>liked me.
WENDY=>Come on...
DONALD=>Hey, where are they...
ADAM=>Where do you think? The woods. Tender goodbyes and what-have-you.
PIXEL=>Can you cover for us, Donald?
DONALD=>Not like I got anything better to do.
ADAM=>Don't worry, we'll help you get the ponies back in the stables. Okay campers, party's over..!
DONALD=>Well Jasper, my one and only homosexual friend, it looks like it's just you and me tonight.
DONALD=>The cook? Charlie, the cook?
JASPER=>Don't laugh. He's the only thing on the menu I'm allowed to eat.
COOK=>Ouch.
DONALD=>Go on, girlfriend...
WENDY=>Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
WICHITA=>What do you want me to say?
WENDY=>Something more interesting than that...How could you? How could--!
WICHITA=>Stop! Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
WENDY=>Iunno. Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible ] for you to make me feel worse, ] but...you're saying you deliberately ] destroyed us! I don't even get I'm- ] sorry-it-was-the-heat-of-the- ] moment... ] WICHITA ] I know, I'm...I'm evil. ] WENDY ] Oh that's right, baby, you're so ] "evil." You're, you're so "dark"... ] WICHITA ] We should get back. ] WENDY ] You're not evil or dark...you're ] just scared. ]
WICHITA=>Shut the fuck--!
ADAM=>It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
PIXEL=>Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
ADAM=>Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
PIXEL=>Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
ADAM=>But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
PIXEL=>And this Peepers was your...dog? If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
ADAM=>That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
PIXEL=>Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
ADAM=>Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
RADIO ANNOUNCER=>You keep requesting it. We keep playing it-- "Oh, my unforgettable Summer Love."
WICHITA=>What do you want from me? You want the good stuff. You want to know that my father, in the three years ] before he died, only had custody ] of me for the summer and he sent ] me to camp. You want to hear that ] I thought that was the only decent ] thing he ever did. Here's another ] good one: I was misdiagnosed as ] schizophrenic at 14 and given a bunch ] of poison that almost killed me. ] Keep going? ] WENDY ] Oh Wichita... ] WICHITA ] Don't "Oh Wichita" me. I refused ] to be defined by such bullshit ] trivia. I take that back, I'm defined ] by that shit and all sorts of other ] shit that you can't rip out of me. ] I don't want to be cured! That's what makes me a good camp counselor, because I protect who I am and I pass that on. I make the kids question things; I teach them how to get through life, decode it, attack it...
DONALD=>All the magazine polls say that the trait most looked for in a lover is a "sense of humor"! Now that's funny! I'm the most hilarious fucking guy in the world and I have never touched a human breast! But I digress, let's do this attack for all of us who have ever been told "Wait here, while the rest of us have all the fun." For all of us who have been told "You're too young and uncool to understand." Let's do this attack because it's not like we have anything better to do tonight. Are you with me?
OBERON=>What was I thinking, taking all this time off, playing God? Nobody tells you how to be an adult. But you just keep getting older anyway. That girl almost died! We needed an authority figure on that beach today! Is it too much to ask for a little order! Is it too much to...
ADAM=>You think you're so...but you're just...
PIXEL=>That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
ADAM=>Damnit, spermicidally lubricated!
WICHITA=>No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
WENDY=>Yes! God yes! I would tell her that I love her! To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
WICHITA=>Just forget--You didn't bring me out here to help me change. You brought me out here to punish me.
WENDY=>Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever. You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
WICHITA=>What are you doing, Wendy? What's in that cup?
ERIC=>Great shot! Todd, I think we finally found something you totally suck at. High-five!
TODD=>Don't touch me.
DONALD=>Now!
OBERON=>Camp is over. Rise. Shine. Now. You can pick up all your "missing" crap ] in the mess hall. Move it. ]
WENDY=>I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
PIXEL=>Clever observation. Go back to Wichita. Oh that's right, you can't.
PIXEL=>...sorry...
WENDY=>This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
PIXEL=>One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
WENDY=>Yeah. And?
PIXEL=>It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
ERIC=>There you are! Man, I don't know how to thank...
WICHITA=>Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
ERIC=>Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
ANDREW=>I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
JASPER=>Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
ANDREW=>You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
JASPER=>Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
ANDREW=>Did you wait until you were 18?
JASPER=>Yes.
ANDREW=>I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
JASPER=>You have no idea. Now run away.
WENDY=>Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
DONALD=>Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
WENDY=>No.
DONALD=>That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
DONALD=>Hey, we didn't do this for the money, we did it for...help me out...
DONALD=>Oh no, I'm sorry, I refuse to go out with this doom-and-gloom. I'm getting a picture from you complex individuals. Hold on, let's get a kid in here...
DONALD=>Now stop pretending you didn't have any good times...Shooting stars. Frogs down pants. Surely, at some point, one of us watched a baby deer being born. Come on...Smi-ile.
