GAGARIN=>Slow rotation, stage cutoff. Calculated orbit achieved.
GAGARIN=>A sense of weightlessness... I see, I am over America.
FUCKING AIRCRAFT EVER MADE.=>But just now, it isn't flying... or rather, not flying alone. Neil’s X-15 is attached to the wing of a B-52 -- BALLS 8, a four engine BEHEMOTH that’s shaking even more than the X-15. It’s more than a bit terrifying, but Neil calmly hits another switch as he’s KNOCKED across the cockpit.
NEIL=>Rog, precool on, lox pump bearing plus eight.
JOE=>Seem to be a tad steep.
JOE=>Very nice, Neil. Posse will get there shortly.
JOE=>You okay? NEIL
NEIL=>For Gemini?
ISOLATION ROOM=>Two TECHS walk Neil into the empty, windowless room.
INTERVIEW ROOM=>A STACK of 'TESTS' is dropped on a desk in front of Neil. He eyes the first test. For each of the paired statements below, select the statement that best fits your personality. Neil digs in: I worry a lot about things in the future that could go wrong; It takes a lot for me to get angry.
EXAM ROOM TWO=>A foot PLUNGES into an ICE BATH.
ISOLATION ROOM=>We see nothing, hear nothing... but Neil.
EXAM ROOM ONE=>More ice water shoots into Neil's ear. The tech nearby glances at his stopwatch. Neil’s jaw sets.
INTERVIEW ROOM=>A last pair: I like to help friends when they’re in trouble; I like to do my best in whatever I undertake. Neil reads, thinks and circles NUMBER TWO. Then he puts the test aside and reaches for the next one. Draw a picture of yourself. A beat. As Neil starts to draw --
EXAM ROOM TWO=>Neil's foot in an ice-bath. Turning WHITE. The tech with the stopwatch jots down a note. Neil doesn't move.
INTERVIEW ROOM=>Neil finishes a fairly generic stick figure drawing of himself. He turns the page. Draw a picture of your family. Neil HARDENS. As he STARES at the blank page, we CUT TO -- ISOLATION ROOM
EXAM ROOM TWO=>Neil's foot in an ice bath. Now BLUE. Neil bears down.
EXAM ROOM ONE=>WHOOSH... The tech unloads another syringe into Neil's ear. PUSH IN on Neil, blank, NUMB. And as we go TIGHT ON HIS EYES, we see it again. The pain there. The deep, deep PAIN.

NEIL=>I got it.
GILRUTH=>Neil A. Armstrong. Frank F. Borman, Jr. Charles ‘Pete’ Conrad...

KSC CAPCOM=>Yes, we read you, Neil. We’re at T minus 2 hours. PUSH IN CLOSER to the white room level, just outside the capsule. Men in flight suits prep for launch.
ELLINGTON TOWER=>Nasa 7, you’re cleared for approach, come on down outta that soup... As Elliot guides the plane down, he chats with his co-pilot in the rear cockpit, CHARLIE BASSETT, 34, all American.

NEIL=>I can’t talk to you, I’ve got to figure this.
DAVE SCOTT=>Gemini 8 to Houston, we’ve got a visual on the Agena. ...just as he says it, the Agena SWINGS out of the window.
DEKE=>You okay, John?
DAVE SCOTT=>Houston, this is 8. We’re sitting about 2 feet out. HOLD ON Neil and Dave, waiting on the precipice.
DAVE SCOTT=>None of our thrusters are on, it must be the -- Dave quickly follows orders. Neil WATCHES the 8 ball...
NEIL=>Reset the Agena to allow remote command. Dave follows orders. Neil GRABS the throttle.
VARIOUS PRESS=>Mrs. Armstrong? Janet? INT. LIVING ROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - HOUSTON - SAME TIME Ed PUSHES into the house with Janet, press calling out after them until Ed SHUTS THE DOOR. The press falls back.
VARIOUS PRESS=>Can we get a photo? Jan?
NEIL=>I keep thinking there’s something we’ve forgotten about...
GILRUTH=>Gemini 8 saw two complex vehicles launched on the same day, on time...

NEIL=>It’s always a sad day when you lose a machine.
SENATOR MONDALE=>...we’ve spent more than we did on the Manhattan project, we’ve put our most talented young men at risk, and what are the odds of success?

CAPCOM=>...45 seconds to Bingo.
MIKE COLLINS=>You need to consider abort--
CAPCOM=>30 seconds to Bingo. Neil?
MIKE COLLINS=>...you’re almost out of fuel. Neil remains unresponsive. The hiss is DEAFENING. Buzz looks from Neil to the FUEL GAUGE, eyes filled with ANXIETY.
NEIL=>Position.
ERIC SEVAREID=>That gives me more foreboding, I think, than anything else...
