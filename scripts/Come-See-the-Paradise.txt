LILY=>I don't know why I left your Papa that day. But sometimes you get pushed and pulled without ever knowing the reasons why. But I knew I couldn't stay. I had to be with Mama and Papa Kawamura.
DETECTIVE=>Do you have a history of labor union business, McGann? It is McGann, isn't it?
JACK=>Yeah, McGann. No. No I don't. I work in the cannery. I'm a fish masher.
DETECTIVE=>You people caused quite a stir.
JACK=>It was a legal demonstration, sir. Perfectly within the constitution...
DETECTIVE=>Well, all that striking stuff's over now, mister. When the Japs step on the beach, you think they're gonna take any notice of your banners? They'll stick a goddamn bayonet in your belly, grievance or no grievance. This is America, pal, so remember, you're an American. We're at war now.
JACK=>What are you talking about?
DETECTIVE=>Ain't you heard? The Japs just bombed Pearly Harbor. It's all over the radio.
DULCIE=>Lily! You never said you were coming!
JOYCE=>I knew you would come back!
LILY=>Joyce, you've grown!
DULCIE=>Is that Mini? She's so cute!
LILY=>Harry!
HARRY=>Lily! It's good you came. It's great to see you.
LILY=>It's nice to see you, too. Where's Mama?
JOYCE=>She's upstairs.
LILY=>Who are these men?
HARRY=>FBI. They're searching the house.
DULCIE=>They arrested Papa, Lily.
LILY=>What?
HARRY=>They've arrested many Issei. All the Kendo big shots. They say Papa's a potentially dangerous alien.
DULCIE=>They've searched the house three times.
LILY=>Papa? Dangerous?
DULCIE=>Charlie's at the police station to find out what's happening. Where's Jack?
LILY=>He's in Seattle.
LILY=>Mama? Mama? I'm so sorry. I'm sure things will be all right, Mama. They'll know Papa is a good man. He never harmed anybody. He didn't do anything wrong. They'll see that and...Mama. I wrote to you all these years and you never once wrote back. Dulcie told me that Papa wouldn't let you write. But it never upset me because all the time I pretended that you did...Every week I would write to you as if you were reading all my letters and sending to me all your news. I told you everything...just like we used to talk. If Mini had a cold, or fell over and cut her knee, I'd let you know. I know you wanted to write, Mama...I'm so sorry, Mama. I love you. Please, talk to me, Mama.
MINI=>Mama?
MAMA K=>Mini? Mini-chan? Come here. Come here. Oh, Mini-chan! I missed you, Lily.
LILY=>I'm here now, Mama.
LILY=>Did you see him?
CHARLIE=>He's okay. He's depressed, but he's okay. He's asked for his shaving stuff and some clean shirts and socks. He left without any socks.
HARRY=>They're going to keep him here on Terminal Island for a day or two and then they're sending him away.
LILY=>Where to?
CHARLIE=>He thinks North Dakota.
LILY=>But why? What did he do?
CHARLIE=>They say he was a member of the Nippon Bunka Kyokai and Nichibei Kinema, so he's had direct contact with the enemy.
LILY=>But they were only cultural societies. They were plays he was bringing over, not machine guns.
CHARLIE=>And movies. Don't forget the crummy movies. They're a dangerous weapon. They can bore you to death.
LILY=>What are we going to tell Mama?
HARRY=>The truth.
LILY=>But they could be home in a week.
CHARLIE=>People say they're going send all of us away.
LILY=>All of us? Nisei, too?
CHARLIE=>All of us.
LILY=>We're not open. Mr. Matsui is not here.
JACK=>Where's Mr. Matsui?
LILY=>He's been arrested. So has my father.
JACK=>Why?
LILY=>They're Japanese.
JACK=>I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.
LILY=>I heard you were in jail.
JACK=>Probation.
LILY=>What happened to your arm?
JACK=>A horse.
LILY=>You were on a horse?
JACK=>Under it.
LILY=>Oh, Jack!
JACK=>Oh, Lily! Lily! I'm sorry. It's all right. It's all right. Oh, Lily. I missed you so much.
JACK=>They could break both of my arms and my legs and it could never hurt me as much as losing you, Lily. You have a happiness inside you that makes you so beautiful. It's as if someone gave you a little bag of magic that only you can dip into. And I see the way you look at Mini and in your eyes is something so perfect no one can touch it. No one can cheat you or steal it away from you because it's something no one else can have. I love you so much, Lily. You're braver than anyone I ever knew. You have everything that I never had. And I was still so blind and stupid I didn't see that you were looking at me the same way as you looked at Mini and that nothing else mattered. You were just giving me a little handful of that magic. And no one, and no thing, is ever going to take that away from us. No one. Never.
JACK=>So you're going to be really nice to him, okay?
MINI=>Yes.
JACK=>Now what you do is tell him who you are, and you tell them that you're the goodest girl in America, and then you just sort of slip in about what you want for Christmas, okay? And then he's gonna tell his elves. And his elves, they work for him. They work overtime for no pay. And they make all the toys for all the boys and girls in America. Did you know that? Here you go. Sit on Santa's lap.
SANTA=>Scoot, pal. I ain't sitting no Japanese kid on my lap, for Christ's sakes.
JACK=>Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Santa. We're the next in line here.
SANTA=>No Japs. Sorry, fellah. It ain't my rule. Just read the sign. Japs don't have Christmas anyway, they're Buddhists.
JACK=>No, wait. Just a second. Please ma'am. Please, just a second. Baby, come here, just for a second. I'm going to sit you down right here and Daddy's gonna talk to Santa. Okay?
MINI=>Yeah.
JACK=>Okay. Look, that little girl ain't no Buddhist, pal! As a matter of fact she's a Christian and she believes in Santa Claus. Now either you're going to sit her on your lap and let her tell you what she wants for Christmas or I'm gonna stuff this fuckin' beard down your fuckin' throat, fattso!
SANTA=>Mickey! Will you get over here. A trouble maker!
MICKEY=>Come on! Come on! Out! Out! Out!
JACK=>Get your hands off of me! All I want is for my little daughter to sit on this jerk's lap!
MICKEY=>We don't serve Japs here, pal. Read the sign. Read the sign. What, are you from an orphanage or something?
JACK=>No, I'm not from an orphanage! She's an American and I'm her father! She's an American! Merry Christmas!
JOYCE=>Should we leave the latch up on the door Mama, in case Papa comes back and we're asleep?
CHARLIE=>He won't be back tonight.
DULCIE=>He might be.
HARRY=>Jack, your turn. Everyone has to sing.
JACK=>I don't sing.
CHARLIE=>C'mon, Jack! Whoever heard of an Irishman who didn't sing?
JACK=>I don't sing.
LILY=>He can sing.
JACK=>I do not.
LILY=>Yes you do. He's just shy. Make him sing.
JACK=>*Jack sings a song from an old 1930's Japanese movie.
CHARLIE=>4C? Enemy alien? I can't believe this shit!
HARRY=>"Friendly" enemy alien.
CHARLIE=>Yeah, what about the Germans and the Italians? Is Joe Di Maggio an enemy alien for Christ's sakes?
HARRY=>Shikataganai!
CHARLIE=>Shikataganai, shit! It's wrong, Harry! It's terribly wrong!
LILY=>Those were very bad days for us. At the time, the Japanese Army seemed to be winning all the battles. And every time a couple of whales popped their heads up from the ocean, someone said they were Japanese submarines about to attack California.
LILY=>For us the war was so far away. We were in Los Angeles and we were Americans. Or we thought we were Americans. But people looked at our faces and we weren't Americans anymore. We were the enemy.
MINI=>Were you frightened?
LILY=>No, not really. Because we really couldn't believe what was happening. And then Mr. Roosevelt signed the "Executive Order Number 9066" saying that all Japanese families must be sent away.
MINI=>To the camps?
LILY=>At first we didn't know where, and suddenly in March, they told us that we had six days to go.
MINI=>Six days?
LILY=>Six days, to pack up everything and leave.
MINI=>I remember that part.
DULCIE=>If there's not going to be thyphoid where we're going, why do we have to have typhoid shots?
JOYCE=>What's typhoid?
DULCIE=>I'll be scarred for life. I heard some people got crippled from these shots.
LILY=>Stop it, Dulcie. Don't exaggerate.
DULCIE=>It's true! Judy Hayashi told me.
JOYCE=>Do we have to get rid of everything, Harry?
HARRY=>We can only take what we can carry. Seventy pounds. The rest has to go.
FRANKIE=>Everything?
HARRY=>Everything.
FRANKIE=>What about the chickens?
HARRY=>We'll leave the chickens.
DULCIE=>The Ogawas had to kill their chickens.
JOYCE=>How about the dog?
FRANKIE=>We can't take the dog?
LILY=>Mrs. Fu is taking the dog.
DULCIE=>Don't Chinese eat dogs?
FRANKIE=>What about my mitt? Can I take my mitt?
DULCIE=>Sure you can take your mitt. Wherever we're going, they're not going to stop you from playing baseball. Are they?
CHARLIE=>Uh, this gentleman wants to see the piano.
HARRY=>Certainly. Come on Joyce, show this gentleman what a fine piano it is.
CHARLIE=>I got fifteen dollars for the Bendex.
LILY=>Are you okay?
JACK=>I'm going to take Mini for a walk. Okay?
LILY=>You okay, Mama?
MAMA K=>Mm.
LILY=>What are you burning?
MAMA K=>Just stuff. We cannot take it with us and it's too...precious to leave behind. I don't want people going through our things. How many things you keep. In Japan, people don't have so many things. You know, when I first got off the steamer at Angel Island...pretty name, isn't it? ...all I had was the clothes I was wearing, a small bag, a pretty hat and a parasol. Things I hate burning most are your school reports. How are people going to know how well you did?
LILY=>They'll know, Mama. They'll know.
LILY=>The man didn't buy the piano?
HARRY=>He didn't offer enough.
LILY=>How much?
DULCIE=>Ten dollars.
HARRY=>I got him up from five. I said I'd sooner burn it.
FRANKIE=>How do you burn a piano?
DULCIE=>What are we going to do with these old records? They're all Japanese. No one's going to buy them.
LILY=>Break them.
JOYCE=>Break them?
LILY=>Sure. Break them.
DULCIE=>Good bye, Jack.
LILY=>When will you get back from Seattle?
JACK=>Just a couple of days. A week at the most. I'm just gonna check in for my parole and then I'm coming.
LILY=>If only we knew where we were going.
JACK=>I'll find you, Lily. Good bye, Mama. Don't worry. This won't be for long, I'm sure.
DULCIE=>Why are the blinds down?
HARRY=>So we won't know where we're going.
JACK=>You okay?
MINI=>Yes.
JACK=>Okay.
MAMA K=>Rattlesnakes?
WOMAN=>And rabbits...
MAMA K=>Huh?
WOMAN=>...that bite.
DULCIE=>I want to throw up.
CHARLIE=>You don't want to throw up.
WOMAN=>And mosquitoes.
DULCIE=>I want to throw up.
JOYCE=>You don't want to throw up.
WOMAN=>Big mosquitoes. The size of sparrows that suck your blood.
CHARLIE=>Oh shit! She did throw up.
JACK=>Hey! Hey, get out of here! You get out of here! Fucking little vultures!
CHARLIE=>I can't bring my camera?
SOLDIER=>Sorry, it's on the list.
FRANKIE=>Thanks for coming with me, Lily.
LILY=>That's okay. I was scared to come on my own as well.
FRANKIE=>Do you think they'll shoot us?
LILY=>No, of course not.
FRANKIE=>Do you think they'll send us back to Japan?
LILY=>I don't know. I truly don't know, Frankie.
FRANKIE=>I've never been to Japan.
LILY=>Me either.
LILY=>We stayed at the race track for two months...until they moved us to a new home, way out in the desert.
LILY=>The journey on the bus seemed to go on forever. And finally we arrived. But all I could remember was the mountains, the cold, and the dust.
CLERK=>Next! You have twenty-four hours to report for drafting, Mr. McGann. Your parole is annulled under Section 472 of the War Powers Act.
JACK=>But, um, I need to go to Los Angeles.
CLERK=>Don't think so. It says Tacoma. Yep, Tacoma. You report tomorrow. It's pretty clear, else...
JACK=>Else what?
CLERK=>Else you'll find yourself in jail instead of the Army, mister. Next, please.
LILY=>We lined up for everything. We seemed to spend half our lives lining up for something or other. Our lives had changed completely and we spent our whole time pretending they hadn't.
MAMA K=>What is it?
DULCIE=>Something about stealing food. There's a man with blood all down his apron. I think he got punched.
FRANKIE=>You wanna play one on one after, Charlie?
CHARLIE=>No.
DULCIE=>There's a guy with his nose split wide open.
CHARLIE=>Michi Hokoda saw ten sides of beef under a sheet in the back of one of the administrator's trucks.
JOYCE=>Maybe they're starving us to death.
DULCIE=>"Too much slop suey gives you spots, makes you pooey!"
HARRY=>We have enough to eat.
MAMA K=>Gambare. Shikataganai, ne?
CHARLIE=>It's got to be stopped. Or else someone's going to get their throat cut!
HARRY=>It's hard feeding all these people. It's a fucking camp for Christ's sakes!
LILY=>Don't swear in front of Mama.
HARRY=>She doesn't know the word.
MAMA K=>I know the word.
CHARLIE=>It's not a camp. A camp is where you go fishing. Sit around fires made from rubbing two sticks together. This isn't the fucking Boy Scouts, Harry!
JOYCE=>Charlie, please don't swear in front of Mama.
CHARLIE=>She's Japanese! She doesn't understand the word.
MAMA K=>I know the word.
LILY=>Mama. It's Papa!
PAPA=>Mini-chan? Mini-chan! Oh! Oh!
LILY=>Kiss your grandpa.
PAPA=>Oh, thank you!
LILY=>Papa Kawamura never was happy at the camp. People whispered and whispered. Silly, spiteful rumors that he had given information to the FBI when he was at Fort Lincoln. It wasn't true, but it didn't matter. In those days, people only believed the worst. No one would talk to him and he got lonelier and lonelier. Sadder and sadder.
JOYCE=>Alice Noguchi! How could they pick her? She's got a face like a latrine bucket.
DULCIE=>Big tits! They always pick the one with big tits.
FRANKIE=>They're not so big.
JACK=>Thanks for stopping.
MAN=>If you can find room back there, you're more than welcome, soldier. You all right?
JACK=>Yeah.
HARRY=>One of the JACL-ers has been beaten up. They're blaming the kitchen union people. There's going to be trouble. We should get home, Mama.
MAMA K=>Where's Charlie?
HARRY=>I don't know Mama.
MAN=>Where you stationed?
JACK=>Fairmont.
MAN=>On a 24-hour?
JACK=>What's left of it.
MAN=>You got friends down at the camp?
JACK=>Yeah, kind of.
MAN=>Real good people, some of them Japs. Had a couple of them working for me. Real hard workers. Trouble is, you don't know which ones to trust, which ones will shoot you in the back. Hard problem. Beats me.
MAN=>What's going on here?
SOLDIER=>Road's closed, sir. You're going to have to back up.
JACK=>What's going on?
SOLDIER=>The Japs in the camp are rioting. They say a whole bunch of them have been shot. It's a mess down there. Okay, sir. Back it up. Try again tomorrow.
MAMA K=>I heard guns. I definitely heard guns.
JOYCE=>I think I saw tanks.
FRANKIE=>They were trucks. Tanks have guns sticking out, stupid.
JOYCE=>I know what a tank looks like!
LILY=>Charlie will be okay, Mama.
HARRY=>God willing.
LILY=>Stay away from the window, there's nothing you can do.
MAMA K=>I heard more guns.
JOYCE=>I wish they'd stop that chanting. It's kind of scary.
LILY=>Charlie will be home soon, Mama.
MAMA K=>Charlie would never get into any trouble.
HARRY=>That was before they took him off hamburgers. Now are "All American" has a rising sun tattooed on his backside. He's changed, Mama.
LILY=>No one changes inside.
LILY=>When they finally opened the camp two days later, your Papa could come visit us. We hadn't seen or heard from him for seven whole months.
JACK=>So was Charlie hurt bad?
JOYCE=>No, he got hit on the head with a rifle.
DULCIE=>He says he's okay, but they put him in the camp hospital anyway. More tea, Mama?
MAMA K=>No. I have to go to the lavatory. That tea does terrible things to my bladder.
DULCIE=>Come on, Joyce. Let's take Mama to the bathroom.
JOYCE=>It's a long walk.
DULCIE=>I don't care. Get your coat on. You're coming. Mini, you wanna come, too?
MAMA K=>Jack, don't go before you say good-bye.
JACK=>All right, Mama. I'll be right here.
LILY=>She'll be twenty-two minutes.
JACK=>Twenty-two minutes?
LILY=>Uh huh. Mama looked all over the camp for a toilet she liked that wasn't broken and had partitions, and it's on the K block. It takes her eleven minutes to walk there, and eleven minutes to walk back. Why do you think we gave her so much tea?
JACK=>Frankie?
LILY=>School.
JACK=>And your Papa?
LILY=>He's at the hospital with Charlie. He sits there all day in a chair next to his bed. Neither of them will talk.
JACK=>Why?
LILY=>Because Charlie thinks that Papa gave the FBI information at Fort Lincoln. Papa hates him for believing it.
JACK=>So, we have twenty-two minutes?
LILY=>Twenty-two minutes. And then I have to get back to work.
JACK=>Work?
LILY=>Mm hm. Camouflage nets. We make five nets or work eight hours. For fourteen dollars a month.
JACK=>Fourteen dollars a month?
LILY=>Don't fret! Doctors only make nineteen a month. People say they've been giving us Army K rations, with all that salt peter...to reduce our sex drives.
JACK=>They have?
LILY=>It's not true.
JACK=>Bye-bye Mini Mouse. You gonna be okay?
MINI=>O.K.
DRIVER=>Come on, fella! Are we goin' or what?
JACK=>Okay.
DRIVER=>Come on! Come on! I got a schedule to keep!
MINI=>Did Papa get into trouble?
LILY=>A little. By the time he got back to Fairmont, he was three days absent without leave. But he was okay.
MINI=>And Papa Kawamura?
LILY=>He just wouldn't talk to anybody.
MINI=>Why was he so unhappy?
LILY=>Because every day he was in America, he talked of one day going home to Wakayama a rich man. But any money he'd have he lose. He'd lost his shirt so many times it never mattered to him. "Shikataganai" he'd always say. But once you lose your self- respect, only then do you truly have nothing.
MINI=>Poor Papa Kawamura. He must have been so sad.
LILY=>For a whole year, he just dug away in his vegetable patch. Or he'd work on his chair. When the chair was finished, he just sat there for hours. We all wanted so badly to have a life here. It's a beautiful country, if only you have eyes to see it. But suddenly, we all felt like a blind man peeping through a fence. SCENE 86
DULCIE=>I don't get it. We all have to sign this thing?
LILY=>Everyone over 17.
DULCIE=>Read it again.
LILY=>Answer yes or no. Number 27: Are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty wherever ordered?
JOYCE=>We have to go in the Army?
DULCIE=>No! Answer no. I don't want to go in the Army. It's bad enough they put us in here!
LILY=>Wait. There's worse.
MAN=>Lily, can I have a word with you, please? Your mother is not allowed to work. She's a Japanese national.
LILY=>We know that.
MAN=>Then could you ask her to leave?
LILY=>No, why should she? She's not getting paid. She's bored. She has nothing else to do. She's just sitting here with her family.
MAMA K=>Is there something wrong?
LILY=>No, Mama. Sit down.
MAN=>Sorry, it's the law.
LILY=>The law? Don't talk about the law. What law protects innocent American citizens from being locked up for no crime?
LILY=>She's not working!
MAMA K=>Lily, maybe I should go.
LILY=>No, Mama. Sit down! She will not leave! Why should she?
LILY=>Rules?
LILY=>Camp? You call this a camp? This is a goddamn outdoor jail!
HARRY=>Number 28: Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America and faithfully defend the United States from any or all attack by foreign or domestic forces...and forswear any form of allegiance or obedience to the Japanese Emperor, or to any other foreign government, power or organization? Answer yes or no.
MAMA K=>But how can we do that? We can't be U.S. citizens. It's against the law. If we say "yes," we won't have any country.
CHARLIE=>So say "no."
HARRY=>If we say no, they'll keep you in the camps forever.
CHARLIE=>If you say yes, you'll be in the Army shooting at other Japanese. Or end up being sent home in a wooden kimono.
HARRY=>But we're Americans.
CHARLIE=>We stopped being Americans the moment they put up the barbed wire!
HARRY=>We have to say "yes," Mama. Papa? Charlie?
CHARLIE=>No. No. What about you?
HARRY=>I'm gonna go in the Army.
JACK=>Joycie?
JOYCE=>Jack!
MINI=>Papa?
JACK=>Mini? Mini! Oh, Mini! Mini! You're so big I didn't even recognize you!
JOYCE=>Hi.
JACK=>Did you lose a tooth?
MINI=>Yes.
JACK=>You did? Where's Lily? No one's home.
JOYCE=>They're at the hospital. Papa's sick.
JACK=>Lily?
LILY=>Jack! Oh, Jack! You didn't tell me you had leave.
JACK=>It was sudden. They ship us out in a week.
LILY=>Where?
JACK=>They won't tell us.
LILY=>Mini? I'm going to take you home now, okay?
JACK=>I'm gonna stay here with your father for a while.
LILY=>Okay.
PAPA K=>Water. Water.
JACK=>It's Jack, Mr. Kawamura. I need your help, sir. You see, I'm not here on leave. I ran away from the Army. God knows why, but I thought that if I could be here with all of you that maybe I could help. But then when I came through those gates back there I realized I can't help, not one little bit. And I just know that this whole terrible thing that's happened is my fault...the big part and the little part. But I just wanted to say that...even if you don't want to hear it...I love you all so much.
PAPA K=>You go back.
JACK=>I can't.
PAPA K=>Go back.
JACK=>I can't leave you all here. I have to do something.
PAPA K=>Just love Lily. That's enough.
JACK=>Papa.
CAPTAIN=>You were married in Seattle?
JACK=>Yes, sir.
CAPTAIN=>Your wife is Lily Yuriko Kawamura?
JACK=>Yes, sir.
CAPTAIN=>And you were drafted May 11, 1942?
JACK=>Yes, sir.
CAPTAIN=>You're in a whole lot of trouble, soldier.
JACK=>Yes, sir. I know, sir.
CAPTAIN=>Would you say you had pro-Japanese sympathies?
JACK=>Yes, sir. I married one, sir.
CAPTAIN=>The way the Army sees it, soldier, you're either pro-Japanese or you're pro-American. There's no in-between. Not anymore. It's not like being a Red Sox fan in a Pittsburgh/New York World Series.
JACK=>My wife is an American citizen, sir.
CAPTAIN=>You think the camps are wrong?
JACK=>Yes, sir. I do.
CAPTAIN=>Well, for what it matters, soldier, I agree with you. It's like burning down Chicago to get rid of the gangsters.
JACK=>It's a God-awful mistake.
CAPTAIN=>That scared people fighting wars often make. But there are also a lot of apple pie Americans out there who wouldn't hate a soul before all of this, who've got kids being slaughtered by the Japanese Army. Everyday they hear about another Japanese unit going Banzai and bayonetting women and kids. Maybe locking your people away is the best place for them.
JACK=>It's unconstitutional. They had their rights taken away from them. The Nisei who were born here are American citizens.
CAPTAIN=>So are you, soldier, and you went AWOL. So a lot of American kids are dying instead of you.
AGENT=>How do you spell your name, McGann?
JACK=>M, small c, G-a-n-n.
AGENT=>You ever spell it M, small c, G-u-r-n? Were you ever Jack McGurn? Were you ever a member of Local 306 of the New York Projectionist Union?
JACK=>Yes I was.
AGENT=>I think you're in a lot of trouble, soldier.
MAMA K=>We had a cousin who knew Papa's family in Wakayama. She sent my picture to your Papa. With your Papa, it was one day new shoes for everyone. The next day, we sell the radio. Once he bought me a new coat in the morning, and we had to sell it by suppertime. All on the flip of a card. Seven times down, eight times up. But now, after all of this, for Papa it was seven times up and eight times down. Sometimes, it's better to die than to give up on life.
LILY=>Then it seemed all we did was say good-bye. Dulcie volunteered to help with the sugar beet harvest in Idaho. At least Dulcie was free, for a while.
LILY=>Charlie was sent to a special camp at Tule Lake with all the others who had answered "no" on their loyalty questionnaires. They were called the "No No Boys."
CHARLIE=>Bye Frankie.
FRANKIE=>Bye Charlie...Hey Charlie, don't take any wooden nickels.
JOYCE=>Why are you throwing up, Dulcie? You're not even on a bus.
LILY=>Dulcie came back from the Idaho Sugar Harvest with a nice sun tan, sixty dollars pay, and a baby inside of her. Mama was furious.
LILY=>Then in December, the Supreme Courts ruled that the camps were unconstitutional.
WOMAN=>Endo won his case! They can't keep us here anymore! We can go home!
LILY=>It seemed that all of our troubles were over. Shikataganai. We had gone through the worst. We had lost everything we owned and everything we loved. It wasn't possible to lose anymore. But Mama says a wasp always stings a crying face...
LILY=>...because we also lost Harry. It was our last winter in the camp. And our darkest.
LILY=>Charlie decided to repatriate to Japan. There was a big exchange for American prisoners of war. Poor Charlie. He had never been to Japan before. He hardly spoke Japanese.
LILY=>We had no home to go back to in Little Tokyo. So we went to stay with Mama Kawamura's cousin, Sahoko, on the strawberry farm here in Florin.
LILY=>On August 6th, they dropped a bomb on Hiroshima. It was a big bomb. They called it the atomic bomb. In nine tiny seconds, two hundred thousand people were killed. It had to be the end. No one could endure more.
MINI=>Mama! It's the train!
LILY=>Let's go.
LILY=>Jack! Jack!
JACK=>How ya doin'?
