SMITH=>The rain will wash out the tracks ...
BURGESS=>I've found it. Crowley couldn't. Mathers couldn't. Only I could.
SMITH=>I didn't see anybody on the road ...
BURGESS=>Thibault had it stolen from the Vatican Library -- that's common knowledge. But then it disappeared. He told Yeats he'd destroyed it. But he didn't. He couldn't. And now -- I've found it.
SMITH=>I don't think anyone saw me.
BURGESS=>Don't worry, Vicar. No one saw you. No one knows what you've done -- except you and me. And God. Just like your other little ... peccadilloes.
SMITH=>Please ... What they say is true. You are the most wicked man alive.
BURGESS=>I've always liked that title.
BURGESS=>The Magdalene Grimoire. Finally.
SMITH=>That's it then? You can do it now? You can ... capture the angel of death?
BURGESS=>Death isn't an angel. She's one of the Endless ... who existed long before angels ... and will exist long after the final cherubim has sung its last hosanna.
SMITH=>Heresy.
BURGESS=>For your sake, hope it's not. The Magdalene Grimoire is all the Order of Ancient Mysteries needed. With it, we will summon and imprison Death. And I will command who shall live ... and who shall die.
SMITH=>Then ... you'll keep our bargain? Please -- you'll keep your promise?
BURGESS=>Of course, Vicar. You have my word. You won't die. And you will never have to stand in the judgment of your God. Good night.
SMITH=>Thank God --
SMITH=>What have I done?
ACOLYTE=>It is midnight, Lord Magus.
BURGESS=>It is time. Elspeth, love..?
BURGESS=>I give you coin I made from a stone. I give you a song I stole from the dirt. I give you a knife from under the hills. And a stick I stuck through a dead man's eye. I give you a claw I ripped from a rat. I give you a name, and the name is lost.
BURGESS=>I give you blood from out of my vein, and a feather I pulled from an angel's wing.
BURGESS=>I summon with poison, and summon with pain. I open the way and open the gates. Come.
BURGESS=>I summon you in the names of the old lords. Namtar. Allatu. Morax. Naberius. Klesh. Vepar. Maymon. We summon.
BURGESS=>From the dark they call you ... into the dark they call you. Coin and song, knife and stick ...
BURGESS=>Claw and name, blood and feather ... Here in the darkness ...
BURGESS=>Here in the darkness, we summon you together. COME!
BURGESS=>No. We failed. This isn't Death. Damn it to hell.
BURGESS=>Even so ... strip him.
BURGESS=>Fool! If you'd broken the circle, he could have escaped!
ACOLYTE=>My god --
BURGESS=>... I think, at day's end, this will have been a very profitable evening's work.
BURGESS=>I know you can grant me boons. Power. Immortality. A promise you won't seek revenge. Well? I know you can understand me. Say something!
BURGESS=>Damn you.
ALEX=>Sir! I found it!
BURGESS=>Yes, Alex?
ALEX=>See? Here. In the Paginarum Fulvarum.
ALEX=>You said he had to be one of the Endless. But it wasn't Death. And it's not Desire, or Despair -- or Destiny. That'd been brilliant if you'd caught him -- um ...
ALEX=>Uh, anyway ... Here.
ALEX=>See? He's Dream. Morpheus, Lord Shaper. the Prince of Stories ... the Sandman.
BURGESS=>Yes. I was hoping you'd work it out on your own one day. And you have. Well done, Alex.
ALEX=>Thank you, father --
BURGESS=>Father?
ALEX=>Thank you, Lord Magus. Sir ... Since you know his true name, can't you make him do what you want?
BURGESS=>Cretin. That kind of magick is too trifling for him and his ilk. The Endless are not mortal
ALEX=>But if they're gods --
BURGESS=>They are not gods. Gods come and go. Gods fade away.
ALEX=>But ... are we safe? What if his brothers and sisters come after us?
BURGESS=>Protection can be had. Deals can be struck ... You've never seen a summoning, have you, son? Tonight, you will. We'll conjure a demon of hell. And trade this -- -- for our safety.
BURGESS=>Inform the acolytes.
ALEX=>Yes, Lord Magus. But what about ... what about him?
RACHEL=>My God ... it's true.
RACHEL=>He's magnificent. And you caught him, Lord Magus?
ALEX=>Actually, it was a mistake. He was trying to --
BURGESS=>Shut up, Alex.
RACHEL=>Is he a demon?
BURGESS=>He's more dangerous than any demon I've known.
BURGESS=>Here. This is what I told you about. The stuff that dreams are made of ...
ALEX=>'Made on.' Quote it right, you old idiot
BURGESS=>No matter how much you take out, there's always some left ... Try it.
RACHEL=>How do I ..? Sniff it?
BURGESS=>Sniff it, swallow it, rub it on your skin ... pour it in your eyes ... it doesn't matter.
BURGESS=>Oh, Rachel ... You are a wild one ...
RACHEL=>Oh ... oh, my ...
RACHEL=>Is he really what old Roddy says he is?
ALEX=>I don't know ... Stupid old Roddy should've died by now and left me in charge ... he really can work some sort of magic ...
RACHEL=>That sand ... that was magic ...
RACHEL=>Please ... just a little.
ALEX=>Come on ...
CORINTHIAN=>Hello, David.
DAVID=>Hello. How did you get in here?
CORINTHIAN=>I wanted to talk to you, David. To tell you that you are not fulfilling your potential.
DAVID=>I'm not? Who are you?
CORINTHIAN=>I'm your friend. You can call me the Corinthian. I want to show you something.
CORINTHIAN=>I've shown other people things like this, David. All through history. But none as special as you.
CORINTHIAN=>You see, David? If you can dream it -- you can be it.
DAVID=>That's all this is? This isn't really happening? This is a dream?
CORINTHIAN=>Sadly, yes. That's the only way I've ever talked to special people. But ... Something has happened, David. And now you can help me. You can free me. As I can free you.
DAVID=>How?
CORINTHIAN=>Wake up, David. Just wake up.
DAVID=>Just a dream ...
CORINTHIAN=>Not any more.
CORINTHIAN=>Good-bye, David. Thank you.
DAVID=>Wait! Will I ever see you again? Will you ... talk with me some more?
CORINTHIAN=>I'll always be here, David. I'll always talk to you. Just listen.
BURGESS=>It's your fault! Damn you! You aren't Death, but you live forever. You haven't aged a day since I caught you. You could have given me power beyond
DEATH=>That's it, let it out.
BURGESS=>Who are you?
BURGESS=>Are you ... you aren't Death ... are you?
DEATH=>Hi.
BURGESS=>I tried to catch you once. Got him instead.
DEATH=>I know.
BURGESS=>Am I ... are you going to punish me? Am I bound for hell?
DEATH=>I'm just here to take you from this world to the next ... Destinations are up to you.
BURGESS=>Oh ... I am. I'm going to hell. I'm Roderick Burgess. I'm the most wicked man alive.
DEATH=>Not anymore.
DEATH=>I'm sorry, little brother ... there's nothing I can do. I ... I miss you.
SANDMAN=>At ... last.
CORINTHIAN=>Beautiful night to be alive, don't you think?
WOMAN=>Stay away from me.
WOMAN=>What did you do?
CORINTHIAN=>Don't worry. I won't kill you. That would draw all sorts of the wrong kind of attention. I just want to look into your eyes --
CORINTHIAN=>He's back. He's BACK. No! It's not fair! I won't allow it. I won't go back!
CORINTHIAN=>Don't worry. I can stop him. I'm not going back.
SANDMAN=>The Gates of Horn and Ivory. Once through, I will see my castle ... I will see --
SANDMAN=>-- my home.
LUCIEN=>Breaks your heart, my Lord, doesn't it?
SANDMAN=>Lucien?
LUCIEN=>One and the same, my Lord. At your service, as always. Welcome home.
SANDMAN=>What happened here?
LUCIEN=>What happened? You are the incarnation of this dreamtime, Lord. With you gone, the place ... it started to crumble ...
LUCIEN=>I was aware of it in my Library. Slowly, the words began to fade. Some time after you vanished, my books became volumes of blank paper. The next day the whole library was gone. I never found it again.
SANDMAN=>I'm sorry, Lucien.
LUCIEN=>I ... I tried, sir. I did my best. We all did.
SANDMAN=>Let's see how it is, then.
LUCIEN=>Most of the palace servants turned back into the dream stuff you made them with --
MATTHEW=>He's back? He's really back?
MATTHEW=>Where have you BEEN? Are you all right? What happened?
SANDMAN=>I was detained.
MATTHEW=>Ha. Detained. You haven't changed, that's good news.
SANDMAN=>Nor have you, Matthew.
MATTHEW=>It's a pisser, ain't it?
LUCIEN=>It hurts me, too, lord.
SANDMAN=>Hurts, yes ... Some power returns to me, simply by being here. But I placed too much of myself in my tools. And they are gone.
SANDMAN=>I wonder ... I wonder if it is all even worth rebuilding.
MATTHEW=>Hell, I wonder if he can.
LUCIEN=>My Lord -- some things you should know, items that need attention right away. Many of the nightkind are missing. Lesser dreams. And ... One of the major nightmares.
LUCIEN=>The Corinthian. Escaped into the waking world, I'm afraid.
SANDMAN=>How long?
LUCIEN=>Twenty years.
SANDMAN=>There is no telling the harm he may have caused in that time. I blame myself. Had I been here, fulfilling my function ...
MATTHEW=>Aww ... it wasn't your fault, boss.
SANDMAN=>No? Then whose? And, in my absence, how much further havoc has been visited upon the waking world?
DOCTOR=>Patient seventeen, night terror episode at eleven-oh-five.
DOCTOR=>Did you get that?
ASSISTANT=>It's gotta be some kind of record. Three day observation program, and she's never made it past a level 2 sleep pattern. Even then just for a few minutes.
DOCTOR=>Three days without REM sleep? She should see things crawling the walls by now.
ASSISTANT=>No sign of hallucinations. She's part of the benzodiazepine study
DOCTOR=>What's her name?
ASSISTANT=>Rose Walker.
DOCTOR=>We do appreciate your participation, Miss Walker. Um, if we could persuade you, we'd like to have you back for an individual --
ROSE=>Yeah, yeah, I know. Lemme guess. I'm special. You've never seen anything like
DOCTOR=>Yes --
ROSE=>Look, no offense, but ... I've been monitored and studied and hooked up to wires since I was ten. If I thought there was any chance that you guys could get me a good night's sleep, I'd take you up on it. But --
PAUL=>How'd you do?
ROSE=>It'll get me through another semester. You?
PAUL=>Same. Walk you home?
ROSE=>... sure.
PAUL=>Listen, Rose ... I'm sorry I ... Sorry that ...
ROSE=>Yes, Paul..?
PAUL=>That I couldn't talk to you ... after the other night.
ROSE=>Paul ... don't worry about it. We just had some kind of emotional meltdown and we ended up in bed. It's been known to happen.
PAUL=>I really wasn't looking for, uh, you know. I was just ... I've been blocked for so long, and you listen so easy. I was afraid that I'd, I don't know, seduced you --
ROSE=>I'm a grown woman, Paul ... and the whole tormented artist thing is not nearly as attractive as tormented artists think it is. Look, this was just one of those things. One of those bells that occasionally
PAUL=>A trip to the moon on gossamer wings?
ROSE=>Just one of those things.
PAUL=>Hey ... let's go have lunch.
ROSE=>I'm sorry -- I've got too much to deal with in my life right now. Okay?
PAUL=>I was thinking ... just, maybe we should talk some more?
ROSE=>Paul, no.
PAUL=>Rose --
PAUL=>Okay. The truth of the matter is, I know all we're going to be is great friends -- But right now, everybody in your whole building is up with your roommate putting together a surprise birthday party for
ROSE=>Really?
PAUL=>Uh-huh. Act surprised, okay?
ROSE=>Okay ... So, um ... pals, then?
PAUL=>Pals. For now. And probably forever. But I just don't like saying 'never.'
ROSE=>Okay. Deal. After all, no one knows their own destiny, right?
DESTINY=>Sister. I stand in my Gallery, and I summon the family to me. It is I, Destiny of the Endless, who calls you. Come.
DEATH=>Hiya, big brother. What's up?
DESTINY=>I am calling a conclave of the Endless, Sister. Do you not feel you should be more appropriately attired?
DEATH=>Satisfied?
DESTINY=>Yes. I am satisfied. Sibling, I stand in my Gallery, and I call you ...
DESIRE=>I see he hasn't redecorated in the last three hundred years. So what's the occasion?
DESPAIR=>Destiny will tell us that in his own time, Desire. He won't be rushed ...
DESIRE=>I see you dressed for the occasion, Despair.
DEATH=>Shush. Be nice. It's been years since the family was together.
DESTINY=>Sister Delirium. Youngest of the Endless. I stand in my Gallery, and I call you --
DEATH=>Hi, sis. How are you doing?
DELIRIUM=>uh. YesterDAY i did SomE really BAD stuff. I meaN REal bad. YOU know. but TOdAY i DiD some GOOD things. I don't knoW --
DESTINY=>Hush, little sister. There is one more to be summoned.
DESTINY=>You know why I have called this family meeting.
DESPAIR=>Brother Dream is back. I thought you had gone for good.
DESIRE=>Abandoned his realm, abandoned his responsibilities ...
SANDMAN=>I had no choice in the matter.
DELIRIUM=>DesTiNY couLD hAVe Told yOu WHAT was ComINg. BUT he wouLdn't 'cAUse he's meAN.
DESTINY=>I could not turn that page until it was
DESIRE=>Oh, do. This could be fun.
DESTINY=>The dreams of men became chaotic. One man's dream could infect thousands. Dreams of freedom, of subjugation, dreams of equality, dreams of death. Dark or light made no matter, if the dreamer strong enough.
DELIRIUM=>i juST made butter-flies. LOOK, everyBody! LOOk at whaT I just DiD ...
DESTINY=>Brother Dream. You must decide. Will you repair your kingdom, and return to your throne?
SANDMAN=>I am not sure that I am needed. Or that I wish to resume my mantle.
DESIRE=>I could make you wish to.
DESIRE=>I am Desire, am I not? Where I touch, things want and need and love, drawn like butterflies to a candle-flame.
DESPAIR=>You mean moths.
DESIRE=>Butterflies.
DELIRIUM=>thoSe Were MINE. you didn't HaVe to do thAT!
DESPAIR=>We should not argue. We should not fight.
SANDMAN=>You have been quiet, sister. What say you?
DEATH=>What say I? Well, I'll tell you. And I'm only going to say it once, so you'd better pay attention.
DEATH=>You are utterly the stupidest, most self- centered, appallingest excuse for an anthropomorphic personification on this or any other plane.
DEATH=>What we do aren't just responsibilities. These aren't just jobs. We didn't answer ads in the classifieds because we wanted the health care. Destiny, Desire, Death -- this is what we are. And you -- are Dream.
DEATH=>I'm glad you're back. I was worried about you.
SANDMAN=>I will repair my kingdom. To do so I must recover my tools of power: Pouch, Helm, and Ruby.
DESTINY=>The path is chosen, then.
SANDMAN=>But I don't know where they are. Brother, could you ..?
SANDMAN=>No. Of course not. Sisters, can you be of any assistance?
SANDMAN=>My pouch of sand, which controls dreams. Do any of you have knowledge of it?
DELIRIUM=>i kNow! I KNoW! TheRe's a WOman namED Rachel -- she haS IT! BuT I don'T KNoW where SHe is. NeiTHeR doeS ShE.
DELIRIUM=>Rachel remembers another: Rose Walker. Perhaps she can lead you to your pouch. It hurts me to be this way.
SANDMAN=>Then stop.
DELIRIUM=>DesTINy? I'm SORry. I didn't MEaN to calL you meAn. I mean, i meant to, bUt I dIdn't MEAN it whEN I meant To.
DESTINY=>I know.
SANDMAN=>My Dreamstone, my Ruby Moonstone, which can alter the fabric of reality. Where is it?
DESIRE=>A very desirable item, hm? Stolen from a king by a mage, stolen from a mage by a thief. And that's the last I know of it. Sorry.
SANDMAN=>And my helm of office, which protects me between realms?
DESPAIR=>It was traded to a demon long ago. It now abides in Hell. I am too familiar with that place.
SANDMAN=>Thank you.
SANDMAN=>My ruby is missing. And I am not strong enough to face a single demon, let alone the hordes of hell.
DEATH=>So ... the pouch?
SANDMAN=>Yes. My sister, I pray you tell our siblings that I was needed elsewhere, and I could not stay.
SANDMAN=>Adieu.
DEATH=>Great. Now I get to worry about him some more ...
ALEXANDER=>Carlos ... ?
CORINTHIAN=>Alexander Burgess, I presume.
CORINTHIAN=>Oh my, such decadence.
CORINTHIAN=>Dear Alexander ... you spent a lot of time here, didn't you? It stinks of worry
CORINTHIAN=>You've worn a path. And stood here for long periods of time ...
CORINTHIAN=>Get up! You've been awake for the past two minutes. Your breathing betrays you.
ALEXANDER=>I knew ... it had to happen.
ALEXANDER=>Stupid. But I had to ... to ...
CORINTHIAN=>Pay penance? Set the record straight? Make a fortune off the movie sale?
ALEXANDER=>Hardly. You're probably the only one whose ever read the damn thing. Want me to sign it?
CORINTHIAN=>No.
ALEXANDER=>The Ruby.
CORINTHIAN=>Yes.
ALEXANDER=>Is Carlos dead?
CORINTHIAN=>Yes. Your lover?
ALEXANDER=>Pilot and body guard. I haven't had much interest in lovers -- male or female -- in a long time. Although I had my share of both, once ...
ALEXANDER=>This gave them to me. It gave me everything I ever desired ...
CORINTHIAN=>Except the one thing you ever really wanted. Your father's love.
ALEXANDER=>You're going to kill me now?
CORINTHIAN=>I believe so.
ALEXANDER=>With a knife. How prosaic. I bought the yacht for safety. Open water, supposed to guard against magic attack.
CORINTHIAN=>Your father was right, Alexander. You are an idiot.
CORINTHIAN=>You had the Ruby Moonstone of the King of Dreams. Reality itself in your sway. And all you could do was feed your callow little hungers.
CORINTHIAN=>Not that I take issue with indulging pleasures ...
CORINTHIAN=>But you never understood how to truly use the Stone. You had the power to change the whole world. And you wasted it.
CORINTHIAN=>But that's pretty much true of all you mortals, isn't it?
ALEXANDER=>Who are you?
CORINTHIAN=>I'm your worst nightmare. I'm -- That's it. Your worst nightmare.
PARTY-GOERS=>SURPRISE!
KELLY=>Were you surprised?
ROSE=>I'm a cynical old woman now. Nothin' surprises me.
ROSE=>Oh -- oh, look at it! Is it mine?
SAMANTHA=>Happy birthday, Rose.
SAMANTHA=>I thought you needed something in your life cute and warm and fuzzy and demanding, and I didn't know any men, so
KELLY=>I wasn't sure you'd like it --
ROSE=>No, no ... it's perfect. Purr-fect. I love it.
KELLY=>She needs a name.
ROSE=>It's a she? That's easy. Her name's 'Dinah.'
KELLY=>Dinah?
SAMANTHA=>Oh -- like in Alice in Wonderland. You know Rose ...
ROSE=>So ... can I at least imagine I inspired you and you were able to get back to work?
PAUL=>I wish. No, still blocked. I haven't painted in ... months, is it months? Shit. And you know about the sleep trouble. I've been having this weird dream ...
KELLY=>A weird dream? You gotta tell Sam ... she's a nut for this stuff. Sam, come here! He's going to tell us a dream.
SAMANTHA=>Ragin'. So tell.
PAUL=>I dreamt I was climbing a rock face, this sheer, like, spire --and I hate to climb. I hate high places in general. I'm an artist, and I don't even open my windows to look at the view --
KELLY=>The dream ..?
PAUL=>Right. So I'm climbing, and I've reached the top.
PAUL=>I can't go higher. I can't climb all the way back down. And I can't let go. I can't fall.
PAUL=>I just can't. Because if you fall in a dream, and you hit the ground -- you die. Right?
KELLY=>I think that's just an old wives' tale.
SAMANTHA=>I tend to trust old wives.
PAUL=>So ... ah ... I figure it's about being blocked. Right?
SAMANTHA=>It sounds like an anxiety dream.
ROSE=>What if you dream about being anxious about sex?
KELLY=>Is that what you dream about?
ROSE=>I don't dream. Never have.
SAMANTHA=>You mean you don't remember.
SAMANTHA=>So this spire ... basically long, and phallic? And you're clinging to it, huh?
PAUL=>Whoa, wait a second --
ROSE=>Hi. So are you being lonely or just aloof?
SANDMAN=>You noticed me?
ROSE=>Yeah ... it wasn't hard. I looked behind
SANDMAN=>I am not usually noticed unless I wish to be.
ROSE=>Ah ... okay, Ninja-boy. Well, have fun lurking.
SANDMAN=>Wait. I require your assistance.
ROSE=>My assistance ..?
SANDMAN=>I am searching for a possession of mine. A leather pouch, full of sand.
ROSE=>A pouch ..?
SANDMAN=>A woman named Rachel stole it. I want it back.
ROSE=>Then go get it. And leave me the hell alone.
ROSE=>Rachel ... is my mother. My mother the junkie. She was stoned when I was conceived, she was stoned when I was born, she was stoned ... she is always stoned. The state finally took me away.
ROSE=>I hear from her once in a while -- when she remembers she maybe had a kid somewhere. Happy birthday.
SANDMAN=>Then you do know where she is.
ROSE=>I know where she was a year ago.
SANDMAN=>Take me to her. I will grant you a boon.
ROSE=>A boon?
SANDMAN=>Yes.
ROSE=>Like a gift? Like in a fairy tale? That kind of boon?
SANDMAN=>Yes. I am Dream, of the Endless. I am the Master of Dreams. If it is within my power, you shall have it.
SANDMAN=>And ... I need your help.
SANDMAN=>Please.
ROSE=>This is too weird. My mother ...
ROSE=>'Be open to new experiences.'
ROSE=>All right. We really don't get to choose these things, do we? I'll take you there.
ROSE=>But that doesn't mean I believe you. What a line. The Master of Dreams. Yeah, right.
SANDMAN=>The pouch is here.
ROSE=>How do you know?
SANDMAN=>I know.
