LIBRARIAN=>Hello? Is anybody there?
LIBRARIAN=>All right! Who's there? Lyle? Is that you?
VENKMAN=>Now I'm going to turn over the next card and I want you to concentrate and tell me what you think it is.
VENKMAN=>All right. What is it?
SOPHOMORE=>A square?
VENKMAN=>Good guess -- but no.
VENKMAN=>Now just clear your mind and tell me what you see.
COED=>Is it a star?
VENKMAN=>It is a star! That's great. You're very good.
VENKMAN=>Now think.
SOPHOMORE=>Circle?
VENKMAN=>Close -- but definitely wrong.
VENKMAN=>Ready? What is it?
COED=>Ummm -- figure eight?
VENKMAN=>Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
COED=>No. They're just coming to me.
VENKMAN=>Well, you're doing great. Keep it up.
VENKMAN=>Nervous?
SOPHOMORE=>Yes. I don't like this.
VENKMAN=>Well, just 75 more to go. What's this one?
SOPHOMORE=>Two wavy lines?
VENKMAN=>Sorry. This isn't your day.
SOPHOMORE=>Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this.
VENKMAN=>You volunteered, didn't you? Aren't we paying you for this?
SOPHOMORE=>Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks. What are you trying to prove?
VENKMAN=>I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
SOPHOMORE=>I'll tell you the effect! It pisses me off!
VENKMAN=>Then my theory was correct.
SOPHOMORE=>Keep the five bucks. I've had it!
VENKMAN=>Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
COED=>Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
VENKMAN=>Definitely. I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
STANTZ=>Drop everything, Venkman. We got one.
VENKMAN=>Excuse me for a minute. Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here. Can you come back in about an hour?
STANTZ=>Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition. It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away. Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
VENKMAN=>Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens.
STANTZ=>No, this one's for real, Peter. Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale. Buried the needle. We're close this time. I can feel it.
VENKMAN=>Okay. Just give me a second here. I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
COED=>Eight o'clock?
VENKMAN=>I was just going to say "eight." You're fantastic!
STANTZ=>Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years. The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
VENKMAN=>Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff. You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience. And what have you seen?
STANTZ=>What do you mean by "seen?"
VENKMAN=>Looked at with your eyes.
STANTZ=>Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
VENKMAN=>Uh-huh. I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
VENKMAN=>Egon?
VENKMAN=>Egon!
SPENGLER=>Oh! You're here.
VENKMAN=>What have you got, Egon?
SPENGLER=>Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here.
VENKMAN=>Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head. Do you remember that?
HEAD LIBRARIAN=>Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian. Are you the men from the University?
VENKMAN=>Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
HEAD LIBRARIAN=>Thank you for coming. I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
VENKMAN=>One thing at a time. We don't even know what it is yet.
LIBRARIAN=>I don't remember seeing any legs, but it definitely had arms because it reached for me.
STANTZ=>Arms! Great! I can't wait to get a look at this thing.
VENKMAN=>All right, miss. Have you or has any member of your family ever been diagnosed schizophrenic or mentally incompetent?
LIBRARIAN=>Well, my uncle thought he was St. Jerome.
VENKMAN=>I'll call that a big "yes." Do you yourself habitually use drugs, stimulants or alcohol?
LIBRARIAN=>No.
VENKMAN=>I thought not. And one last thing. Are you currently menstruating?
HEAD LIBRARIAN=>What's that got to do with it?
VENKMAN=>Back off, man! I'm a scientist!
SPENGLER=>It's moving!
VENKMAN=>Nice. Hello...
SPENGLER=>It's here.
STANTZ=>What is it?
VENKMAN=>It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
SPENGLER=>It's a woman.
STANTZ=>I told you it's real.
VENKMAN=>What do we do now?
STANTZ=>I don't know. Talk to it.
VENKMAN=>What do I say?
STANTZ=>Anything! Just make contact.
VENKMAN=>Hey, Lady? Lady! Can you talk? Who are you? This is not working. Think of something else.
STANTZ=>Okay. Okay. I got it. I know what to do. Stay close. I have a plan.
STANTZ=>Okay, now do exactly as I say. Everybody ready?
STANTZ=>Okay... GET HER!!!
THE GHOST=>QUIET!
HEAD LIBRARIAN=>Did you see it? What was it?
VENKMAN=>We'll get back to you.
VENKMAN=>"Get her?" That was your whole plan? You call that science?
STANTZ=>I guess I got a little overexcited. Wasn't it incredible! I'm telling you, this is a first. You know what this could mean to the University?
VENKMAN=>Oh, yeah. This could be bigger than the microchip. They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us. We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
SPENGLER=>I wouldn't say the experience was completely wasted. Based on these new readings, I think we have an excellent chance of actually catching a ghost and holding it indefinitely.
STANTZ=>Then we were right! This is great. And if the ionization rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, I think we could really kick ass -- in the spiritual sense.
VENKMAN=>Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
SPENGLER=>I'm always serious.
VENKMAN=>Wow!
VENKMAN=>Egon, I take back everything I ever said about you. Take this. You earned it.
VENKMAN=>If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
STANTZ=>If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
VENKMAN=>Yeah, but I introduced you guys. You never would've met if not for me. That's got to be worth something.
VENKMAN=>I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
DEAN YAEGER=>No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS. The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant. You are to vacate these premises immediately.
VENKMAN=>This is preposterous! I demand an explanation.
DEAN YAEGER=>Fine. This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
VENKMAN=>But why? The students love us!
DEAN YAEGER=>Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind. You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle." Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable. You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
VENKMAN=>I see.
STANTZ=>You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
VENKMAN=>Ray, I apologize. I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced. They did this to Galileo, too.
DEAN YAEGER=>It could be worse, Dr. Venkman. They took the astronomer Phileas and staked his head to the town gate.
STANTZ=>This is like a major disgrace. Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
VENKMAN=>You're always so worried about your reputation. We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
STANTZ=>Do you know what a patent clerk makes? I liked the University. They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything! I've worked in the private sector. They expect results. You've never been out of college. You don't know what it's like out there.
VENKMAN=>Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason. Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever. I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
STANTZ=>For what purpose?
VENKMAN=>To go into business for ourselves.
STANTZ=>I don't know. That costs money. And the ecto-containment system we have in mind will require a load of bread to capitalize. Where would we get the money?
VENKMAN=>You'll never regret this, Ray.
STANTZ=>My parents left me that house, I was born there.
VENKMAN=>You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
STANTZ=>But at nineteen percent interest! You didn't even bargain with the guy.
SPENGLER=>Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
VENKMAN=>Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations. The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
STANTZ=>But most people are afraid to even report these things.
VENKMAN=>Maybe. But no one ever advertised before.
R/E WOMAN=>Besides this, you've got another substantial work area on the ground floor, office space, sleeping quarters and showers on the next floor, and you have your full kitchen on the top level. It's 10,000 square feet total.
SPENGLER=>It's 9,642.55 square feet.
R/E WOMAN=>What is he -- your accountant?
STANTZ=>Wow! Does this pole still work?
VENKMAN=>This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think? We're trying to keep our costs down. You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
R/E WOMAN=>Yes, I know. What are you calling your business?
STANTZ=>Ghostbusters.
R/E WOMAN=>Oh, well, this place is perfect for it.
LOUIS=>Oh, Dana, it's you ...
DANA=>Hi, Louis.
LOUIS=>... I thought it was the drug store.
DANA=>Are you sick, Louis?
LOUIS=>Oh, no, I feel great. I just ordered some more vitamins. I see you were exercising. So was I. I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
DANA=>No thanks, Louis. I'm really tired. I've been rehearsing all morning.
LOUIS=>Okay. I'll take a raincheck. I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that. Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients. It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant. I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
DANA=>Oh, that's nice, Louis. I'll stop by if I'm around.
LOUIS=>You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out. That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
DANA=>I thought I turned it off. I guess I forgot.
LOUIS=>I climbed on the window ledge to see if I could disconnect the cable but I couldn't reach so I turned up the sound on my TV real loud so they'd think there was something wrong with everybody's TV. You know, you and I should really have keys to each other's apartment ...
LOUIS=>... in case of emergencies ... ... like this one.
TV SCREEN=>INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
FATHER=>What is it? What's wrong?
THE KIDS=>Look!
MOTHER=>Oh, dear. It's that darn ghost again. Can't you do something about it.
FATHER=>I've tried everything, honey! I guess we'll just have to move.
MOTHER=>Gee, there must be a better way.
STANTZ=>Are you troubled by strange noises in the night? Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic? Have you or your family actually seen a spook, specter or ghost? If the answer is yes, then don't wait another minute. Just pick up the phone and call the professionals -- Ghostbusters.
SPENGLER=>Our courteous and efficient staff is on call 24 hours a day to serve all your supernatural elimination needs.
JANINE=>Ghostbusters. We'll be right there.
STANTZ=>Got him! I don't think you'll have any more trouble with that ghost.
FATHER=>And it's economical, too!
MOTHER=>How can we ever thank you?
VENKMAN=>All in a day's work, ma'am. After all ... ... We're Ghostbusters.
THE FAMILY=>If you have a ghost, But you don't want to play host, You can't sleep at all, So who do you call ... Ghostbusters - Ghostbusters.
GHOSTBUSTERS=>We're ready to believe you,
THE PRESENCE=>ZUUL!!!
STANTZ=>Everybody can relax. I found the car. How do you like it?
VENKMAN=>Do you think it's wide enough? How much?
STANTZ=>Fourteen hundred.
STANTZ=>Just needs a little suspension work ... And a muffler ... And maybe brakes.
JANINE=>You're very handy, I can tell. I bet you like to read a lot, too.
SPENGLER=>Print is dead.
JANINE=>That's very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. Some people think I'm too intellectual. But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time. I also play racketball. Do you ever play?
SPENGLER=>Is that a game?
JANINE=>It's a great game! You should play sometime. I bet you'd be good. You seem very athletic. Do you have any hobbies?
SPENGLER=>I collect spores, molds and fungus.
JANINE=>Oh, that's very - unusual.
SPENGLER=>I think it's the food of the future.
JANINE=>Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
VENKMAN=>Hello. I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?
DANA=>Yes ... well ... I'm not sure. What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
VENKMAN=>We're all professionals here, Miss ...
DANA=>Barrett. Dana Barrett.
VENKMAN=>Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it. Hold all my calls, Janine.
JANINE=>What calls?
DANA=>... and then I opened the door again but it was gone. There was nothing there.
VENKMAN=>So what do you think it was?
DANA=>I think something in my refrigerator is trying to get me.
VENKMAN=>Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. What do you think, Egon?
SPENGLER=>She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
DANA=>Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
VENKMAN=>Some people like the attention. Some people are just crazy.
STANTZ=>You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
SPENGLER=>Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious. And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
DANA=>I'm sorry. It's just that I don't believe in any of these things. I don't even know my sign.
SPENGLER=>You're a Scorpio with your moon in Leo and Aquarius rising.
DANA=>Is that good?
VENKMAN=>It means you're bright, ambitious, outgoing and very, very sexy,
DANA=>Is that your professional opinion?
VENKMAN=>It's in the stars.
STANTZ=>Why don't I check out the building? It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
VENKMAN=>Good idea. Were any other words spoken that you remember?
DANA=>No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
VENKMAN=>Spengler, see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature. I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
VENKMAN=>Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
DANA=>No. If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real. I'm not ready to do that.
VENKMAN=>You play the cello! It's my favorite instrument.
DANA=>Really? Do you have a favorite piece?
VENKMAN=>I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
DANA=>That's a violin concerto.
VENKMAN=>Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
DANA=>You really don't act like a scientist.
VENKMAN=>No? What do I act like?
DANA=>Like a used car salesman.
VENKMAN=>Thanks. What's in there?
DANA=>That's the bedroom, but nothing ever happened in there.
VENKMAN=>That's too bad.
DANA=>What?
VENKMAN=>Nothing. Is that the kitchen?
DANA=>Uh-huh.
VENKMAN=>Well, let's check it out.
DANA=>I'll wait here if you don't mind.
VENKMAN=>You're quite a housekeeper.
DANA=>I told you, I ...
VENKMAN=>I know. It happened by itself.
VENKMAN=>Nothing.
VENKMAN=>Damn!
DANA=>Are you all right?
VENKMAN=>Yeah, yeah.
VENKMAN=>There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
DANA=>This is terrible. Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
VENKMAN=>If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
DANA=>Thanks. Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
VENKMAN=>I'm a qualified psychologist. I've got a degree and everything. I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
DANA=>All right. What do you want to do?
VENKMAN=>I think I should spend the night here.
DANA=>That's it. Get out.
VENKMAN=>On a purely scientific basis.
DANA=>Out!
VENKMAN=>I want to help you.
DANA=>I'll scream.
VENKMAN=>Don't scream.
DANA=>Then leave.
VENKMAN=>Okay, okay. But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
DANA=>All right.
VENKMAN=>Okay. Then I'll go.
DANA=>Goodbye.
VENKMAN=>No kiss?
STANTZ=>How was your date?
VENKMAN=>It wasn't a date. It was an investigation.
SPENGLER=>Did you see anything?
VENKMAN=>Didn't see anything, Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost. I'm starting to worry. You said your graph was pointing to something big. You told me things were going to start popping.
STANTZ=>They will.
VENKMAN=>Do you know when that might be? We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
BRIDE=>Aren't you glad we waited?
GROOM=>I don't know. It probably would've been the same.
BRIDE=>Well, thanks a lot.
BRIDE=>What are you doing? Are you just going to roll over and go to sleep? I don't believe this.
BRIDE=>Roy? Your clock broke.
GROOM=>Nice going, honey. It was brand new.
BRIDE=>I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
BRIDE=>Now where are you going?
GROOM=>To the bathroom, where do you think?
BRIDE=>Have I done the right thing?
BRIDE=>Roy? Are you all right?
BRIDE=>Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
GROOM=>Uuuuuuugh!!
BRIDE=>What's the matter, dear?
BRIDE=>What did you do in here? It smells awful!! OH ... Oh, no ... Oh, my God.
GROOM=>... right ... It's smelling up the whole suite ... I don't know ... It's just hanging off the ceiling ... I've never seen anything like this ... 1210 ... Quick ...
JANINE=>Ghostbusters ... Yes, it is ... Yes, of course they're serious. You do! You have! Yes, sir. Well, they're out on another case now, but if you'll give me the address ... Don't worry, they'll be totally discreet.
MANAGER=>Thank you for coming so quickly. The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
STANTZ=>Has this ever happened before?
MANAGER=>Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
STANTZ=>Did you ever report it to anyone?
MANAGER=>Heavens, no! The owners don't like us to even talk about it. I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
STANTZ=>Yes, sir. Don't worry. We handle this kind of thing all the time.
GUEST=>What are you supposed to be?
VENKMAN=>Me? We're ... uh ... the exterminators. Somebody saw a cockroach on the twelfth floor.
GUEST=>That's gotta be some cockroach,
VENKMAN=>Well, you can't be too careful with those babies.
STANTZ=>I just realized something. We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
SPENGLER=>I blame myself.
VENKMAN=>So do I.
STANTZ=>No sense worrying about it now.
VENKMAN=>Sure. Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back. No problem.
VENKMAN=>Cease fire!
STANTZ=>Sorry, Buddy!
SPENGLER=>We'd better adjust our streams.
SPENGLER=>Something was definitely here.
VENKMAN=>Yeah, I can smell it.
STANTZ=>I'm getting high readings near the air vents. It must be using the duct system to get around. See, I told you we'd get something.
VENKMAN=>So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
STANTZ=>All right. Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
WOMAN=>Yes?
SPENGLER=>Were you recently in the bathroom?
WOMAN=>What on earth gave you that idea?
SPENGLER=>The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
WOMAN=>You're a regular Sherlock Holmes. Now what do you want?
SPENGLER=>When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
STANTZ=>Egon! I got something. I'm moving in.
STANTZ=>Yaaaaaaaaah!
SPENGLER=>Ray! Where are you? Are you all right?
STANTZ=>God, it's ugly!
STANTZ=>I'm moving in. I don't think it's seen me yet.
STANTZ=>Ugh! What a slob! I'm going to take him. Freeze, Potato-Face!
STANTZ=>He's getting away!
VENKMAN=>This bites it. I actually work for a company called Ghostbusters.
VENKMAN=>Ray -- Something's here.
STANTZ=>Where are you, Pete?
VENKMAN=>Third floor. Get down here,
STANTZ=>Sit tight. I'm on my way.
VENKMAN=>Well, hurry up. The needle's going wild.
VENKMAN=>It's here, Ray. It's looking at me.
STANTZ=>Don't move. It won't hurt you.
VENKMAN=>How do you know?
STANTZ=>I don't know. I'm just guessing.
VENKMAN=>Well, I think you guessed wrong. Here he comes!
VENKMAN=>Veeaaaaaahh!
VENKMAN=>Aagghh -- aaaggghh -- uhh -- uhh -- It slimed me! It slimed me!
SPENGLER=>Ray! It's here! It just went into the Banquet Room on the third floor.
STANTZ=>Visors down. Full stream.
STANTZ=>There! On the ceiling! Come on down here, you slug!
SPENGLER=>Wait! Wait! There's something I forgot to tell you.
VENKMAN=>What?
SPENGLER=>Don't cross the beams.
VENKMAN=>Why not?
SPENGLER=>Trust me. It will be bad.
VENKMAN=>What do you mean "bad?"
SPENGLER=>It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
VENKMAN=>That's it! I'm taking charge. You guys are dangerous.
VENKMAN=>Now nobody does anything unless I order you to, okay?
VENKMAN=>Let's do it. This thing's not going to hang around all day waiting for us. Ray, give me one stream wide right of it. I'll go wide left. Now!
VENKMAN=>Good ... Good ... Nice and wide ... Move with him ... Easy. Hold steady.
VENKMAN=>Now, very slowly, Ray, let's tighten it up. You hold steady. I'm coming down.
SPENGLER=>Don't cross them! Watch it!
VENKMAN=>Spengler! A little help! Cut him off.
STANTZ=>I'll nudge it out of the corner. You cut off the left side.
VENKMAN=>You got it! That's good. Easy now.
STANTZ=>It's working!
SPENGLER=>Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
STANTZ=>Easy ... Easy ... Open the trap now!!
VENKMAN=>Watch it ... Watch it ... Now!
SPENGLER=>He's in here.
STANTZ=>Well! That wasn't so bad, was it?
VENKMAN=>Are you kidding? That was like trying to push smoke into a bottle with a baseball bat. Now what do we do with it?
VENKMAN=>We'll have to work on that. Grab that, would you, Ray?
HOTEL MANAGER=>What happened? Did you see it? What is it?
STANTZ=>We got it!
HOTEL MANAGER=>What was it? Will there be any more of them?
STANTZ=>Sir, what you had there was what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal repeating phantasm or a Class Five Full Roaming Vapor ... A real nasty one, too.
VENKMAN=>That'll be $4,000 for the entrapment plus $1,000 for proton recharge and storage.
HOTEL MANAGER=>Five thousand dollars! I won't pay it. I had no idea it would be so much.
VENKMAN=>Fine. We'll let it go again. Ray! Bring it back.
HOTEL MANAGER=>No! All right. Anything.
STANTZ=>We got one!
STANTZ=>Uh...I'm afraid not.
VENKMAN=>This is not a sideshow! We're serious scientists.
STANTZ=>Proof? Well, the manager of the Sedgewick just paid us five big ones to get something out of there. Is that real enough for you?
VENKMAN=>Not only do they exist, they're all over the place! And that's why we're offering this vitally important service to people in the whole tri-state area. We're available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. We have the tools and we have the talent. No job too small, no fee too big. We're ready for anything.
STREET PUNK=>Mister! Hey, Mister! Come here! Mister.
STREET PUNK=>Hey, Mister! Can I see those guns?
SPENGLER=>They're not guns. They're particle throwers.
STREET PUNK=>Yeah, yeah. I just want to see 'em.
SPENGLER=>I couldn't do that. You might hurt someone.
STREET PUNK=>Wait! Wait! Let me ask you something. If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
SPENGLER=>On Earth -- no. But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
STREET PUNK=>Wow!
MINICAM REPORTER=>Sing the song from your commercial.
STANTZ=>No, we have to get back and ...
MINICAM REPORTER=>Come on. It's free advertising.
VENKMAN=>There's a thought. Hit it, Ray.
STANTZ=>Ghostbusters ... If you have a ghost But you don't want to play host ...
ALL TOGETHER=>Ghostbusters ... Ghostbusters.
ANNOUNCER=>Hello, America. This is Ronald Gwynne reporting from United Press International in New York. Throughout my entire career as a journalist I have never reported anything as exciting and incredible as the trapping of an actual supernatural entity by a team of men based in this city who call themselves Ghostbusters.
ANNOUNCER=>Now, most of us have never even heard of a floating, slime-like substance called ectoplasm, but these gentlemen claim we will be seeing a lot more of it than ever before.
ROGER GRIMSBY=>Good morning. Today the entire Eastern Seaboard is alive with talk of hundreds of reported incidents involving multiple sightings in what can only be described as extreme events of paranormal extraphenomenical proportions. It seems everybody is willing to bring their old ghosts and skeletons out of the closet. Roy Brady reports from New York.
ROY BRADY=>Thank you, Roger. Everybody's heard ghost stories around the campfire. Heck, my grandma used to spin yarns about a spectral locomotive that used to rocket past the farm where she grew up. Now, as if some unseen authority had suddenly given permission, thousands of people here are talking about encounters they claim to have had with ghosts.
JOE FRANKLIN=>Ray, every time I hear about your company, I can't help thinking about the old Bob Hope movie.
STANTZ=>Actually, Joe, the title of that film was "Ghostbreakers," and Olsen and Johnson did one called "Ghost Catchers" and the Bowery Boys did "Ghost Chasers," "Hold That Ghost," "Spooks Run Wild," "Spook Busters," and "Spook Chasers."
JOE FRANKLIN=>Well, in any case, I guess there's one big question on everybody's mind and you're certainly in a position to answer it for us: Have you seen Elvis and how is he?
LARRY KING=>Our phone-in topic today: Ghosts and Ghostbusting. The controversy builds as more sightings are reported and some maintain that these professional paranormal eliminators in New York are the cause of it all. Why did everything start just when these guys went into business?
LARRY KING=>Should they be allowed to carry around unlicensed proton mass drivers? And what's wrong with ghosts anyway? Call us ... All our lines are open. Hello, Larry King.
FEMALE CALLER=>Hello, Larry? I think what Dr. Spengler said in his interview with you last night was true. The world is in for a "psychic shock" 'cause like my aunt reads coffee grounds and she ...
VENKMAN AND DANA=>She is surprised and a little bit pleased to see him.
VENKMAN=>Great rehearsal.
DANA=>You heard it?
VENKMAN=>You're the best one in your row.
DANA=>Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing. You're good.
VENKMAN=>I don't have to take abuse from you. I have other people dying to give it to me.
DANA=>I know. You're quite a celebrity these days. Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
VENKMAN=>Who's the stiff?
DANA=>The "stiff?" He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
VENKMAN=>Is he dying or something?
DANA=>He is a very close friend. Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
VENKMAN=>Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
DANA=>Can't you tell me now?
VENKMAN=>I'll cancel the reservation, I found the name "Zuul" in ... The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects. I don't suppose you've read it.
DANA=>You must have gotten the last copy.
VENKMAN=>Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
DANA=>Hittites, the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians. "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
VENKMAN=>"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion. One of their gods.
DANA=>What's he doing in my refrigerator.
VENKMAN=>I'm checking on that. I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
DANA=>I don't think so. I'm busy Thursday night.
VENKMAN=>You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients? I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
DANA=>All right. Since you put it that way.
VENKMAN=>I'll pick you up at your place. I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
DANA=>I've got to go now.
VENKMAN=>Remember. I'm the only one standing between you and a heavy Hittite.
VENKMAN=>I'll pick you up at your place.
VIOLINIST=>Who was that?
DANA=>Oh, he's an old professor of mine.
VIOLINIST=>Really?
DANA=>Yes. He's smarter than he looks.
JANINE=>GHOSTBUSTERS -- please hold. Good afternoon, GHOSTBUSTERS -- please hold. Yes, can I help you? Yes ... yes, Is it just a mist or does it have arms and legs ...? Uh-huh ... Well, the soonest we could possibly get to you would be a week from Friday ... I'm sorry, but we're completely booked until then ... Uh-huh ... Well, all I can suggest is that you stay out of your house until we can get to you. Thank you.
WINSTON=>Let me ask you something. The ad in the paper just said "Help Wanted." What's the job?
JANINE=>I really don't know, Mr. Zeddemore. They just told me to take applications and ask you these questions. Do you believe in U.F.O.'s, astral projection, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, full-trance mediums, telekinetic movement, black and/or white magic, pyramidology, the theory of Atlantis, the Loch Ness Monster, or in general in spooks, spectres, wraiths, geists and ghosts?
WINSTON=>Not really. However, if there's a semi-regular paycheck in it I'll believe anything you say.
STANTZ=>Boy, that was a rough one.
VENKMAN=>I can't take much more of this. The pace is killing me.
VENKMAN=>Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job. She paid with a Visa card.
JANINE=>Here are tonight's calls.
STANTZ=>Oh, no. Two more free-roaming repeaters.
JANINE=>And this is Winston Zeddemore. He came about the job.
STANTZ=>Hi. Ray Stantz. Pete Venkman.
JANINE=>And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
VENKMAN=>The EPA? What's he want?
JANINE=>I didn't ask him. All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
VENKMAN=>Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
JANINE=>Oh, really? Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
STANTZ=>Very impressive resume. Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
WINSTON=>Yeah, I heard that. Now tell me what you really do.
VENKMAN=>Can I help you?
PECK=>I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
VENKMAN=>Great! How's it going?
PECK=>Are you Peter Venkman?
VENKMAN=>Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
PECK=>Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN=>I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
PECK=>I see. And now you catch ghosts?
VENKMAN=>You could say that.
PECK=>And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN=>I'm not at liberty to say.
PECK=>And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
VENKMAN=>In a storage facility.
PECK=>And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
VENKMAN=>Yes, it would.
PECK=>And may I see this storage facility?
VENKMAN=>No, you may not.
PECK=>And why not, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN=>Because you didn't say the magic word.
PECK=>And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN=>The magic word is "please."
PECK=>May I please see the storage facility?
VENKMAN=>Why do you want to see it?
PECK=>Well, because I'm curious. I want to know more about what you do here. Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement. Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
VENKMAN=>Go ahead! Get a court order. Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
PECK=>Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
VENKMAN=>Hey! Make yourself useful! Go save a tree!
STANTZ=>Set entry grid.
SPENGLER=>Neutronize. System shut.
SPENGLER=>I've got to sleep.
STANTZ=>I need two new purge valves. How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
SPENGLER=>I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there. And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
WINSTON=>What do you mean "big?"
SPENGLER=>Well, let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area. According to this morning's PKE sample, the current level in the city would be a Twinkie 35 feet long weighing approximately six hundred pounds.
WINSTON=>That's a big Twinkie.
STANTZ=>We could be on the verge of a fourfold crossover ... or worse. If what we're seeing indicates a massive PKE surge, we could experience an actual rip.
VENKMAN=>Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
STANTZ=>It's not good, Pete.
WINSTON=>Tell him about the Twinkie.
VENKMAN=>I can't look anymore. It's too depressing.
LOUIS=>Oh, Dana, it's you.
DANA=>Hi, Louis.
LOUIS=>Hey, it's crazy in here. You're missing a classic party.
DANA=>Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
LOUIS=>Great! Bring her, too. But you better hurry. I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone. I'll make some more though.
DANA=>Fine, Louis. We'll stop in for a drink.
LOUIS=>I got the Twister game for later ...
LOUIS=>Hey. Lemme in ...
DANA=>Hello ... Oh, hi Mom. Yes ... yes. Everything's fine. No ... nothing. Just that one time ... I am ... I will ... I won't ... Mother! I'm all right. I told you. Everything's fine ...! All right. I'll talk to you tomorrow ... I promise. 'Bye.
DANA=>Oh, shit!
TALL WOMAN=>Louis, do you have any Excedrin or Extra Strength Tylenol?
LOUIS=>I have acetacylasilic acid but generic from Walgreens cause I can get 600 tables for 35% less than the cost of 300 name brand. Is it a headache?
LOUIS=>That's Nova Scotia salmon. The real thing. It costs $24.95 a pound but really $12.48 a pound net after tax. I'm writing this whole party off as a promotional expense. That's why I invited clients instead of friends. Try that Brie, it's dynamite at room temperature. Maybe I should turn the heat up a bit ...
LOUIS=>Everybody, this is Ted and Annette Fleming. Ted has a small carpet cleaning business in receivership, but Annette is drawing a salary from a deferred bonus from two years ago and the house has $15,000 left at eight percent.
LOUIS=>Okay. Who brought the dog?
LOUIS=>Help! Help! There's a bear loose in my apartment.
DOORMAN=>How he's got animals up there.
FIRST BUM=>I think you're right about Central America but I completely disagree about the other thing. A good heavyweight boxer could take a Karate guy every time.
LOUIS=>Run! Run!
SECOND BUM=>Rush, rush, rush.
SECOND BUM=>That is one speedy mutt.
FIRST BUM=>He's a big one. You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
SECOND BUM=>Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
LOUIS=>Help! Help!
LOUIS=>Nice doggie. Nice.
LOUIS=>I am Vinz Clortho. Keymaster of Gozer, Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?
COACHMAN=>Hey! He pulls the wagon. I make the deals. You wanna ride?
LOUIS=>Are you the Gatekeeper?
COACHMAN=>No, I'm the Governor of New Jersey. Now get outta here.
LOUIS=>You will perish in flames, subcreature! Gozer will destroy you and your kind! Wait for the sign. Then all prisoners will be released.
VENKMAN=>What's going on?
THE COP=>Some moron brought a cougar to a party and it went berserk,
VENKMAN=>Oh.
VENKMAN=>Dana?
VENKMAN=>Hi. What happened to you? The cop downstairs said an animal got loose up here. What's the story? Are you all right?
DANA=>Are you the Keymaster?
VENKMAN=>Not that I know of.
VENKMAN=>Hey, Dana. What is it? What happened?
DANA=>I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper.
VENKMAN=>I think we better get out of here.
DANA=>We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
VENKMAN=>Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something?
DANA=>He is the Destructor.
VENKMAN=>Really? Can't wait to meet him. As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
DANA=>Do you want this body?
VENKMAN=>Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
DANA=>Take me now.
VENKMAN=>Well, I make it a rule never to sleep with possessed people.
VENKMAN=>Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
DANA=>I want you inside me.
VENKMAN=>I don't know. You've got two people in there already. It could get a little crowded. I want you to close your eyes and relax. Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
DANA=>I am Zuul. I am ...
VENKMAN=>Right ... You're the Gatekeeper. But I want Dana. Dana, speak to me ...
DANA=>There is no Dana. I am Zuul.
VENKMAN=>Whoa!! Nice voice.
VENKMAN=>All right -- Zuul. Listen carefully. I don't know where you came from or why, but I want you to get out of here and leave Dana alone. I'm going to count to ten and when I'm finished, you better be gone. Okay? Here goes. One ... Two ... Three ...
VENKMAN=>Wow!
WINSTON=>Hey man. What is it you're so involved with there?
STANTZ=>Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
WINSTON=>Are you a Christian, Ray?
STANTZ=>Mmmhmmm.
WINSTON=>Me, too.
STANTZ=>Boy! Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
WINSTON=>Do you believe in God?
STANTZ=>No. But I liked Jesus' style.
WINSTON=>Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
STANTZ=>The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
WINSTON=>Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
STANTZ=>And the seas would boil ...
WINSTON=>Right. And the sky would fall ...
STANTZ=>Judgement Day ...
WINSTON=>Yeah, Judgement Day.
STANTZ=>Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
WINSTON=>Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
PARK RANGER=>Evening. We've had a problem here for quite some time. I called your outfit a couple of weeks ago.
WINSTON=>Busy time of year.
PARK RANGER=>Nobody likes to talk about this sort of thing.
STANTZ=>You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
WINSTON=>Right. We'll believe anything.
STANTZ=>You check the armory. I'll go down to the officers' barracks.
SERGEANT=>We picked up this guy and now we don't know what to do with him, Bellevue doesn't want him and I'm afraid to put him in the lock-up. I'm telling you, there's something weird about him. And I know you guys are into this stuff so we figured we'd check with you.
LOUIS=>Are you the Gatekeeper?
SPENGLER=>Bring him inside, Officer.
LOUIS=>I am Vinz Clortho - Keymaster of Gozer.
SPENGLER=>I am Egon Spengler, Creature of Earth, Doctor of Physics, Graduate of M.I.T.
JANINE=>According to this his name is Louis Tully.
LOUIS=>Oh, no. Tully is the fleshbag I'm using. I must wait inside for the sign.
JANINE=>Do you want some coffee while you're waiting?
LOUIS=>Do I?
SPENGLER=>Yes, have some. Vinz, what sign are you waiting for?
LOUIS=>Gozer the Traveller will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldronaii the Traveller came as a very large and moving Torb. Then of course in the third reconciliation of the last of the Meketrex supplicants they chose a new form for him, that of a Sloar. Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Sloar that day I can tell you.
SPENGLER=>Hello?
VENKMAN=>It's Peter, Egon. I've got a problem.
SPENGLER=>What is it?
VENKMAN=>I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
SPENGLER=>Does she want to be?
VENKMAN=>I don't think so. It's more of that Gozer thing. She says she's the Gatekeeper. Does that make any sense to you?
SPENGLER=>Some. I just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now. Venkman? Are you there?
VENKMAN=>Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
SPENGLER=>I agree.
VENKMAN=>You have to keep him there. Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave, He could be very dangerous.
SPENGLER=>All right. I'll try.
VENKMAN=>I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
SPENGLER=>All right, Peter. Good night.
JANINE=>Egon, there's something very strange about that man. I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you. I'm afraid you're going to die.
SPENGLER=>Die in what sense?
JANINE=>In the physical sense.
SPENGLER=>I don't care. I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
JANINE=>That's so romantic.
SPENGLER=>You have nice clavicles. I wonder where Stantz is. I think we're going to need him.
WINSTON=>Stantz? You okay in there?
STANTZ=>LATER, MAN!!
PECK=>This way, Captain.
JANINE=>I beg your pardon! Just where do you think you're going?
PECK=>Step aside, Miss, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with a police officer.
JANINE=>Who do you think you're talking to, Mister? Do I look like a child? You can't come in here without some kind of warrant or writ or something.
PECK=>Cease and desist all commerce order, seizure of premises and chattels, ban on the use of public utilities for non-licensed waste handlers and a Federal Entry and Inspection Order.
JANINE=>This is just like Poland.
PECK=>I want to see what's in there. Now either you shut off those "beams" or we'll shut them off for you.
SPENGLER=>You can see what's inside through the monitor if you wish.
PECK=>I'm not interested in TV right now.
VENKMAN=>At ease, Officers. I'm Peter Venkman. I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
PECK=>Forget it, Venkman. You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me. Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
SPENGLER=>He wants to shut down the storage grid.
VENKMAN=>If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
PECK=>On the contrary! You will be held completely responsible. Turn it off.
VENKMAN=>Don't do it! I'm warning you.
CON-ED MAN=>I've never seen anything like this before. I don't know ...
PECK=>Just do it, fella. Nobody asked for your opinion.
VENKMAN=>Don't be a jerk!
PECK=>If he tries that again, shoot him.
CAPTAIN=>You do your job, pencil-neck. Don't tell us how to do ours.
VENKMAN=>Thank you, Officer.
PECK=>Now turn it off.
LOUIS=>It is time. This is the sign.
JANINE=>It's a sign, all right ... "Going Out Of Business."
GUY IN SUIT=>... does it contain TCE, PCB or tailings from styrene esters or any polyfluoric groups...?
FIRE CAPTAIN=>What are the pink particles? What will happen if we use water?
SPENGLER=>No ... no water. There's nothing you can do.
FIRE CAPTAIN=>Did you have any kind of solvents or any concentrated sulphurs of any kind?
STANTZ=>What happened??!!!?
SPENGLER=>The storage facility blew. This one ... ... shut off the protection grid.
VENKMAN=>Where's the Keymaster?
SPENGLER=>Oh, shit!
STANTZ=>Who's the Keymaster?
PECK=>Stop them! I want them arrested, Captain. These men have been acting in criminal violation of the Environmental Protection Act and this explosion was a direct result.
VENKMAN=>You turned off the power! Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back. A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
PECK=>See! They are using drugs.
SPENGLER=>If you don't shut up I'm going to rip out your septum.
POLICE CAPTAIN=>I don't know what's going on here but I'm going to have to arrest you all. You can discuss it with the judge. I'm going to read you your rights now, so please listen carefully ...
BUSINESSMAN=>Gulf and Western Building! And I'm in a hurry so let's not dawdle.
MUGGER=>Okay ... give me.
LOUIS=>Are you the Gatekeeper?
MUGGER=>Come on. You want me to stick you? Come on.
VINZ=>I am Vinz Clortho. I am the Keymaster. Do you bar my way?
LOUIS=>Do you bar my way?
MUGGER=>Yeah. We bar your way.
WINSTON=>We're gonna get five years for this. Plus they're gonna make us retrap all those spooks. I knew I shouldn't have taken this job.
STANTZ=>Look at the structure of the roof cap. It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
SPENGLER=>And look at this, Peter Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
VENKMAN=>Everybody with us so far?
STANTZ=>The ironwork extends down through fifty feet of bedrock and touches the water table!
VENKMAN=>I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
STANTZ=>No! Nobody ever built them like this! The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius. The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
VENKMAN=>Who was the architect?
STANTZ=>He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
SPENGLER=>Of course! Ivo Shandor, I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE. He started a secret society in 1920.
VENKMAN=>Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
SPENGLER=>Yes. After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive. And he wasn't alone. He had close to a thousand followers when he died. They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
VENKMAN=>She said he was "the Destructor."
SPENGLER=>Who?
VENKMAN=>Gozer.
SPENGLER=>You talked to Gozer?
VENKMAN=>Get a grip on yourself, Egon. I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
STANTZ=>See? I told you something big was about to happen.
WINSTON=>This is insane! You actually believe that some moldy Babylonian God is going to drop in at 78th and Central Park West and start tearing up the city?
SPENGLER=>Sumarian -- not Babylonian,
POLICE OFFICIAL=>Are you the Ghostbusters?
VENKMAN=>What about it?
POLICE OFFICIAL=>The mayor wants to see you -- right away. The whole island is going crazy. Let's go.
REPORTERS=>Are you under arrest? Did you have a bomb factory in the basement? What are you going to do about all these ghosts?
THE AIDE=>The Ghostbusters are here, Mr. Mayor.
MAYOR=>Okay, the Ghostbusters. And who's Peck?
PECK=>I'm Walter Peck, sir. And I'm prepared to make a full report. These men are complete snowball artists. They use nerve and sense gases to induce hallucinations. The people think they're seeing ghosts and call these bozos, who conveniently show up to get rid of the problem with a fake electronic light show.
MAYOR=>You using nerve gas?
VENKMAN=>The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
PECK=>Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
STANTZ=>Bullshit!!!
PECK=>... improperly stored and touched off with those high-voltage laser beams they use in their light show. They caused an explosion.
FIRE COMMISSIONER=>All I know is, that wasn't a light show we saw this morning. I've seen every form of combustion known to man, but this beats me.
POLICE COMMISSIONER=>And nobody's using nerve gas on all the people that have seen those ... things ... all over the city. The walls were bleeding at the 53rd Precinct. How do you explain that?
ARCHBISHOP=>Officially, the Church will not take a position on the religious implications of these ... phenomena. However, since they started, people have been lining up at every church in the city to confess and take communion. We've had to put on extra priests. Personally, I think it's a sign from God but don't quote me on that.
MAYOR=>I can't call a press conference and tell everyone to start praying.
WINSTON=>I'm Winston Zeddemore, Your Honor. I've only been with the company for a couple of weeks, but I gotta tell you -- these things are real. Since I joined these men I have seen shit that would turn you white.
MAYOR=>So what do I do now?
VENKMAN=>Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
PECK=>That's "Peck!"
VENKMAN=>... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
MAYOR=>What do you mean "Biblical?"
VENKMAN=>Old Testament, Mr. Mayor. "Wrath of God"-type stuff. The seas could boil, fire and brimstone falling from the sky ...
STANTZ=>... forty years of darkness, earthquakes, mass hysteria, human sacrifice ...
MAYOR=>Enough! I get the point. But what if you're wrong?
VENKMAN=>If I'm wrong then nothing happens and you toss us in the can. But if I'm right, and if we can stop this thing ... well, let's just say that you could save the lives of a lot of registered voters.
PECK=>I don't believe you're seriously considering listening to these men!
MAYOR=>Get him out of here. We've got work to do. What do you need from me?
MRS. BLUM=>Louis! What are you doing standing there ... get out of the building ... don't you know it's an earthquake or something?
LOUIS=>The Traveller is coming.
MRS. BLUM=>Don't be crazy. Nobody is going to come and visit you with all this commotion going on.
LOUIS=>Are you the Gatekeeper?
DANA=>I am Zuul.
MAYOR=>I don't understand it, Why here? Why now?
VENKMAN=>What goes around, comes around, Mr. Mayor. The big Lazy Susan of Karma just keeps turning and sometimes we get the short end of the stick.
STANTZ=>This may be Nature's way of telling us to slow down. You have to admit it's kind of humbling, isn't it?
MAYOR=>We're humble already! Hasn't this city suffered enough?
CAPTAIN=>We've cleared the whole building and cordonned off the street. I'm massing our own special tactics squad and the National Guard is on standby.
AIDE=>I better alert the Red Cross, too.
JANINE=>I want you to have this.
SPENGLER=>What is it?
JANINE=>It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow. It's my lucky coin.
SPENGLER=>I don't believe in luck.
JANINE=>Keep it anyway. I have another one at home.
SPENGLER=>Thank you.
VENKMAN=>Okay. Just remember, whatever happens out there, we are total professionals. Not only are we the best Ghostbusters around, we're the only Ghostbusters around. It's up to us.
VENKMAN=>Move 'em out!
VENKMAN=>Ghostbusters!
VENKMAN=>Are we all together on this now?
WINSTON=>I think we should get on a plane right now and go to Australia or Indonesia until this blows over.
VENKMAN=>I'm going to make a note of your suggestion and possibly bring it up later if this thing really gets out of hand. Now let's move.
VOICE IN CROWD=>Get 'em!
VOICE IN CROWD=>All right, Ghostbusters!
VENKMAN=>I've heard of underground parking but this is ridiculous.
VENKMAN=>I'm glad we took the stairs.
VENKMAN=>Dana?
WINSTON=>Maybe we should go downstairs and call first?
WINSTON=>Well, she's not here. Let's go.
VENKMAN=>No! The kitchen!
VENKMAN=>Go!
VENKMAN=>Shit! I've been out with some real dogs, but this is ridiculous!
SPENGLER=>It's Shandor - the architect!
WINSTON=>I thought he died!
VENKMAN=>It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
STANTZ=>I don't think it's Shandor.
STANTZ=>Gozer the Gozerian?
STANTZ=>As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
VENKMAN=>Well, that ought to do it.
GOZER=>Are you a god?
STANTZ=>No.
GOZER=>Then die!
WINSTON=>You should've said "yes!" He might have been willing to negotiate.
VENKMAN=>Okay. That's it! I'm gonna turn this guy into toast.
VENKMAN=>Agile bastard, isn't he?
STANTZ=>Forget the trapping! Just blast him!
STANTZ=>We neutronized him! The guy's a molecular nonentity.
SPENGLER=>Not necessarily.
GOZER=>SUBCREATURES! GOZER THE GOZERIAN, GOZER THE DESTRUCTOR, VOLGUUS ZILDROHAR, THE TRAVELLER HAS COME. CHOOSE AND PERISH.
VENKMAN=>Is he talking to us?
WINSTON=>What's he talking about? Choose what?
STANTZ=>What do you mean "choose?" We don't understand.
GOZER=>CHOOSE!!
SPENGLER=>I think he's saying that since we're about to be sacrificed anyway, we get to choose the form we want him to take.
STANTZ=>You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
SPENGLER=>That appears to be the case.
VENKMAN=>Don't think of anything yet. Clear your minds. We only get one crack at this.
GOZER=>The choice is made. The Traveller has come.
VENKMAN=>We didn't choose anything! I didn't think of an image, did you?
SPENGLER=>No.
WINSTON=>My mind's a total void!
STANTZ=>I couldn't help it! It just popped in there!
VENKMAN=>What? What popped in there?
STANTZ=>Look!
VENKMAN=>What is it? Ray, what did you think of?
STANTZ=>It can't be! It can't be!
STANTZ=>It's ... It's ... It's the STAY-PUFT MARSHMALLOW MAN.
STANTZ=>I tried to think of the most harmless thing ... something that could never destroy us ... something I loved from my childhood.
VENKMAN=>AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
STANTZ=>The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man! He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid. We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
VENKMAN=>Great! The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
VENKMAN=>What now?
SPENGLER=>Full-stream with strogon pulse.
VENKMAN=>I guess that's all we've got.
PECK=>Are the Ghostbusters up there?
COP=>Yeah!
PECK=>I want you to go up on the roof and arrest them. This time they've gone too far.
COP=>You arrest them, numb nuts! I'm getting out of here.
VENKMAN=>Hit him!
WINSTON=>Good. Now we made him mad.
VENKMAN=>We're going to be killed by a hundred-foot marshmallow.
VENKMAN=>On the count of three! One ... Two ...
SPENGLER=>No! Them! Shoot them! Cross the beams.
VENKMAN=>No! You said crossing the beams would be BAD. It'll kill her! And us!
SPENGLER=>Life is just a state of mind.
VENKMAN=>But it's my favorite state.
STANTZ=>Either way we're history.
VENKMAN=>Now!!
STANTZ=>Everybody okay?
LOUIS=>Jeez! Somebody must have spiked the egg salad.
VENKMAN=>Are you all right?
DANA=>Oh, sure. I'm getting used to this.
LOUIS=>I'm innocent! Honest, Dana. I never touched you. Not that I remember anyway.
DANA=>All right, what happened to me?
VENKMAN=>Nothing! We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
DANA=>Really! Is it gone?
VENKMAN=>Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work.
DANA=>Thank you. Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
VENKMAN=>This is going to cost you, you know. Our fees are ridiculously high.
DANA=>Talk to my accountant.
LOUIS=>Oh, great! I bet we could write off all the damage as an Act of God.
STANTZ=>I'll go along with that.
FIRST BUM=>Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
SECOND BUM=>Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
FIRST BUM=>You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
SECOND BUM=>I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
FIRST BUM=>That would definitely explain it.
