DOCTOR=>You can call it, Nan. Mark time of birth as... 12:04 A.M. Happy New Year, little lady. Tell Ted he has a girl.
ELLIE=>CQ CQ WR2 GFO... WR2 GFO, come back.
ELLIE=>CQ WR2 GFO, do you copy? I'm not getting anything.
TED=>Small moves, Captain, small moves.
ELLIE=>I can't move any smaller.
TED=>Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
RADIO VOICE=>Copy... WRS GFO... W2P KLD talking... what's your handle, WR2 GFO?
ELLIE=>What do I do?
TED=>Talk to him.
ELLIE=>But what do I say?
TED=>Just be yourself, Captain. Find out where he is.
ELLIE=>Where are you calling from, W2P KLD, come back.
RADIO VOICE=>Pensacola, over.
ELLIE=>Pensacola -- ! Where's Pensacola?
TED=>Give you a hint: orange juice.
ELLIE=>Could we hear to China?
TED=>On that old shortwave? Maybe on a clear night. Come on now, under the covers.
ELLIE=>Could we hear to the moon?
TED=>Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
ELLIE=>Could we hear God?
TED=>Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling.
ELLIE=>Okay, okay... there.
ELLIE=>Pensacola.
TED=>That's a beauty, Captain. Now get some sleep.
ELLIE=>Do you think there're people on other planets?
TED=>Well let's see... the Universe is a pretty big place... And the one thing I know about nature is it hates to waste anything. So I guess I'd say if it is just us, an awful lot of space is going to waste.
TED=>Time to sleep now, Captain. But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
ELLIE=>Okay.
NEIGHBORS=>Ellie... Ellie...?
MINISTER=>I'm so sorry, Ellie. More than I can ever say.
ELLIE=>Those lily pads must look like clouds to that carp, don't you think?
MINISTER=>Ellie... this life doesn't last forever. Some day you and your Dad are going to be together again, in heaven.
ELLIE=>He isn't in heaven; he's in the ground. We just put him there, remember?
ELLIE=>CQ WR2, this is GFO, do you copy? Dad, this is Ellie, come back.
ELLIE=>This is Eleanor Arroway broadcasting on 9.2 megahertz. Dad, are you there? Come back. Come back. Come back...
EVERYBODY=>Right, right --
ELLIE=>I -- uh -- I was looking for Koestler Hall?
GUY=>This is it. Hey, do you know the average radio-luminosity of an E+A elliptical galaxy?
ELLIE=>Um... I'm not sure. Maybe you could deduce it from lensing a post-spectral starburst...?
GUY=>See, I told you! Want some Fruity Pebbles? Carcinogenic, but totally worth it.
ELLIE=>... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
PETER=>It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely. Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which: How're you getting on with the old man?
ELLIE=>He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
PETER=>That's what they all say.
ELLIE=>Ellie. Arroway.
PETER=>Peter Valerian.
ELLIE=>Sounds like a Russian general.
PETER=>Yavol.
DRUMLIN=>You're out of shape, Valerian. What's the matter, eat too many tacos down there in Puerto Rico?
ELLIE=>I read your paper on ETI's. It's brilliant.
PETER=>Keep it down, okay? Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is. Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes. Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
ELLIE=>What a coincidence. It happens to be my fetish too.
DRUMLIN=>You two coming along or you just gonna do it right here in the sand?
ELLIE=>... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about! Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
PETER=>They can't. I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
ELLIE=>It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made. I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
PETER=>'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
ELLIE=>'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
PETER=>I dunno. I know I should be objective, ice-cold hard-assed scientific about it, but just on an intuitive level -- what's the point of a universe so vast if we're the only ones it it? It'd just be such a... waste of space.
ELLIE=>Sorry.
ELLIE=>-- but I've already submitted my proposal!
DRUMLIN=>I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
ELLIE=>I'm willing to take that risk.
DRUMLIN=>I'm not. You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
ELLIE=>Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity. There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
DRUMLIN=>And only two probabilities: One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
ELLIE=>You're --
DRUMLIN=>Two: There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
ELLIE=>What if you're wrong? No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
DRUMLIN=>I disagree.
ELLIE=>Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
DRUMLIN=>What is it that makes you so lonely, Miss Arroway? What is it that compels you to search the heavens for life when there's so much of it being neglected right here at home?
DRUMLIN=>I will approve a general thesis on the detection of radio signals from space but that's all. No E.T.I.s. Enough?
ELLIE=>... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar... God, I've missed you.
PETER=>Any luck on the grant money?
ELLIE=>Please. Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F. I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
PETER=>And?
ELLIE=>I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing. Still, we've barely started...
ELLIE=>... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
PETER=>Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this? I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing. You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
ELLIE=>If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it. This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology. The moment when contact becomes possible. We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
PETER=>How close are you to getting this funding put together?
ELLIE=>It's almost there. The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
PETER=>What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
ELLIE=>The V.L.A.?
PETER=>Thirty-one linked dishes. You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
ELLIE=>Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
PETER=>Actually --
ELLIE=>We could be together again --
PETER=>-- I'm moving to Washington.
ELLIE=>Greenbank?
PETER=>I'm going on staff at the N.S.F. To work for Drumlin.
ELLIE=>But what about your research -- ?
PETER=>This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
ELLIE=>But the work --
PETER=>'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work? Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
ELLIE=>Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
PETER=>Maybe that's the problem. I want... a family, Ellie. I want kids. A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid. A real life. Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
ELLIE=>And you think I don't want those things? You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday? Let's get married.
PETER=>Jesus --
ELLIE=>Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
PETER=>Ellie --
ELLIE=>I'm serious about this, Peter --
PETER=>Ellie -- I'm getting married. Her name's Laura. She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
ELLIE=>You sonofabitch.
PETER=>That is true. But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company. Be honest, El. There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe. And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
VOICE=>Light's behind you, to the left.
ELLIE=>Dr. Cullers?
KENT=>Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor.
ELLIE=>Ellie. Pulsar?
KENT=>1919+21. Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
ELLIE=>Nice. Where?
KENT=>Here, right around Centaurus A.
ELLIE=>This is how you see the sky?
KENT=>It's how I hear it. The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
ELLIE=>It's beautiful.
KENT=>Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
MILLINGTON=>Yo, Ray Charles, time's up. Oh -- sorry --
KENT=>Doctors Millington, Curtain, Dr. Arroway.
KENT=>Rick's doing black holes at the center of galaxies; Tom's studying globular clusters in the e-band. And Dr. Arroway here will be spending her precious time listening for little green men. All yours, guys.
ELLIE=>Um... should I...
MILLINGTON/CURTAIN=>No, no, no -- have a seat.
ELLIE=>Hey, Fish, has that pointing error in twenty-nine been fixed yet?
FISHER=>It's a worm gear; still a little sluggish but it'll have to do.
ELLIE=>J39 Z186...?
WILLIE=>Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
ELLIE=>VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
KENT=>You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep? Try not to take it too personally.
ELLIE=>Thank you, Mr. Sensitive. I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
DRUMLIN=>Now I remember why I went into theoretical work. Kent.
KENT=>Glad to have you, David. How's the new office?
DRUMLIN=>Still settling in, really. Where's Dr. Arroway?
FISHER=>... not that there's a whole lot in the way of entertainment around here but I guess it beats communing with washing machines.
DRUMLIN=>What's that?
KENT=>Nothing. Okay. Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
DRUMLIN=>Tell me.
KENT=>Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
DRUMLIN=>So?
KENT=>So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine. She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
ELLIE=>Pepsi? Tequila?
DRUMLIN=>No, thanks.
DRUMLIN=>Peter sends his regards.
ELLIE=>Oh? How's he doing?
DRUMLIN=>Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
ELLIE=>Really? Congratulations, by the way.
DRUMLIN=>I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
ELLIE=>'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
DRUMLIN=>Now exactly. It's... complicated.
ELLIE=>No doubt.
DRUMLIN=>Ellie...
ELLIE=>Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum? We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore. I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know? And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right? So we've been trying variations of pi...
DRUMLIN=>You know why I'm here.
ELLIE=>It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
DRUMLIN=>Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
ELLIE=>You can't just pull the plug, David.
DRUMLIN=>It's not like you've given me much choice.
ELLIE=>Meaning...
DRUMLIN=>Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
ELLIE=>I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all. Order in the chaos. I'm practicing listening --
DRUMLIN=>The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
ELLIE=>The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work? Well, I do care. Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
DRUMLIN=>No... You're not. But the price has just gotten too high.
ELLIE=>Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
DRUMLIN=>Then why haven't you detected any signals? If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through? It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
ELLIE=>David --
DRUMLIN=>It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
LARRY KING=>My guest tonight is author and theologian Palmer Joss, 'God's diplomat' according to the New York Times. His new book -- Losing Faith -- is currently number one on that publication's bestseller list. Thanks for being with us, Reverend. Okay -- who's losing faith -- and why?
JOSS=>Well, let me start this way, Larry. What has science done for you lately?
LARRY KING=>Besides letting me broadcast this program all over the world?
JOSS=>Besides that. Or better, I'll give you that, but tell me this: Are you happier? Are we happier? Is our would fundamentally a better place?
JOSS=>Don't get me wrong -- we're smart, Larry. We shop at home, we surf the net... and we feel emptier and lonelier and more cut off from each other than at any other time in human history...
WILLIE=>Y'know who'd make great astronomers? Vampires. Think about it; the perfect synthesis of career and lifestyle.
FISHER=>Shut up, Willie.
WILLIE=>Got a bogey, boss?
ELLIE=>I'm not sure. You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
FISHER=>What's the frequency?
ELLIE=>4458.8 gigahertz.
ELLIE=>It's probably nothing.
WILLIE=>Hydrogen times pi... Got it. Strong sucker.
ELLIE=>Put it on speakers.
WILLIE FISHER=>Could be AWACS from Glitch in number Kirtland; verifying seventeen. intensity. Wasn't Monochromatic, strong seventeen where we found too. That was twenty- that owl's nest last three, besides I got month? signal across the board.
FISHER=>Checking interferometric position. Somewhere in Lyra, I think...
ELLIE=>Vega...?
WILLIE=>That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
ELLIE=>I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
FISHER=>Linearly polarized; a set of moving pulses restricted to two different amplitudes --
WILLIE=>Air Force isn't supposed to be on this frequency.
ELLIE=>That's what they always say; punch up the darks.
ELLIE=>How's the spying tonight, guys?
WILLIE=>NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
FISHER=>Interferometry now rules out a Molniya-type orbit.
WILLIE=>Confirming sidereal motion; whatever it is, it ain't local.
ELLIE=>Display absolute intensity.
WILLIE=>Reading over a hundred janskys --
ELLIE=>Numbers. Those are numbers, each pulse is a set -- break it down --
ELLIE=>79 -- 83 -- 91 -- they're all primes, no way that's a natural phenomenon -- !
ELLIE=>Okay, let's just slow down. Pull up the starfield signal origin.
KENT=>It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
ELLIE WILLIE=>Maybe they didn't grow up Constellation Lyra, there, maybe they're just brightest star Vega, visiting. A-zero main sequence dwarf, estimate several KENT million years old. The system's full of debris Distance 26 light years -- any spacecraft that accretion disk, no stayed for long would get known planets. clobbered.
NEARBY SKEPTIC=>Not if they took evasive action and used their photon torpedoes.
ELLIE=>Or if they're in polar orbit -- but no, you're right. If we go public and we're wrong, that's it -- it is over for us. Vega will set in a couple of hours; it's probably already risen in Australia. Let's call Ian and see if we can get some verification on this.
ELLIE=>Okay. We have an intense, not very monochromatic signal, linearly polarized as if coming from an antenna, source moving with the stars so it can't be an airplane or spacecraft; on and only on a frequency whose only significance would be to an intelligence that wanted to be directed. If anyone can come up with any plausible or even implausible explanation besides ETI I want to hear it, now.
WILLIE=>Yeah -- yeah, just a sec --
IAN=>... We put it smack in the middle --
IAN=>Vega.
ELLIE=>Thanks, Ian. Can you just keep tracking it as long as you can and we'll get back to you. Get this out to every observatory and radio array on the planet. Um... and get me the President's Science Advisor.
ELLIE=>Hello, Pensacola...
PROTESTERS=>U-F-O-s -- We want to know --
KITZ=>The President will be making a statement in due time; until then we have no comment.
DRUMLIN=>What's the latest?
WILLIE=>Forty-four stations worldwide now confirming the signal, sir.
DRUMLIN=>Let's get some decryption people here, now. Dr. Lunacharsky's visiting at the University of New Mexico --
KITZ=>I don't get it. If this civilization is so advanced why the remedial math?
SENATE DELEGATE=>Why don't they just speak English?
ELLIE=>Maybe because seventy percent of the planet speaks other languages.
ELLIE=>Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator. We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
DRUMLIN=>If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it. Just one thing: Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
ELLIE=>It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years. As for why... I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
KITZ=>Dr. Arroway --
DRUMLIN=>Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
KITZ=>Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
ELLIE=>Before you do could you please ask the gentlemen with the firearms to wait outside? This is a civilian facility.
ELLIE=>Oh, and if you could ask them not to use their radios -- interference. Thanks so much.
KITZ=>I'll come right to the point, Doctor. Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
ELLIE=>This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz. I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
KITZ=>I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
ELLIE=>You want to classify prime numbers?
DRUMLIN=>Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations. If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
KITZ=>Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
ELLIE=>-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
KITZ=>You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
FISHER=>Oh shit.
ELLIE=>Interference -- we're losing the signal.
KENT=>Can't we get rid of them?
ELLIE=>It's a civilian facility.
KITZ=>Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
ELLIE=>And a hundred mile airspace.
KITZ=>And a hundred mile airspace.
KITZ=>... under control for the moment but the longer we wait the more unstable the situation could become. I think you should consider coming here...
ELLIE=>... could it be a nested code of some sort?
DRUMLIN=>You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
ELLIE=>Dr. Lunacharsky...?
LUNACHARSKY=>Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
LUNACHARSKY=>Bingo.
LUNACHARSKY=>A second layer, nested within the main signal; possibly... a picture? Product of three primes...
KITZ=>What.
LUNACHARSKY=>... definitely three dimensions, either a hologram or a two- dimensional picture that moves in time; a movie.
DRUMLIN=>Hope there's a cartoon.
KITZ=>How is that possible? How could all that information be encoded in --
KENT=>Well, sir, some bits of the signal are bits that tell us how to interpret the other bits. Technically speaking.
ELLIE=>Enlarge.
ELLIE=>Try plotting values in a three dimensional coordinate system.
DRUMLIN=>Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
ELLIE=>Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
ELLIE=>It has to be an image. Stack it up, string-breaks every 60th character.
KENT=>Um... I've got an auxiliary sideband channel here. I think it's audio.
KITZ=>What in the hell...?
DRUMLIN=>It's a hoax. I knew it!
KENT=>Um, excuse me, but would someone mind telling me what the hell is going on?
ELLIE=>Anybody know German?
KENT=>The Fuhrer... welcomes the world to the German Fatherland... for the opening of the 1936 Olympic Games.
GERMAN ANNOUNCER=>... the signal from the American observatory depicting Adolph Hitler has brought about chaos in the streets of Berlin, where hundreds of neo-Nazis gathered to swear eternal fealty...
FEMALE VOICE=>Forty million people die defeating that sonofabitch and he becomes our first ambassador to another civilization? It makes me sick.
DRUMLIN=>With all due respect, the Hitler broadcast from the '36 Olympics was the first television transmission of any power that went into space. That they recorded it and sent it back is simply a way of saying 'Hello, we heard you --'
KITZ=>-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
DRUMLIN=>-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
FEMALE VOICE=>I can't believe that everything on TV is automatically broadcast all over the universe. 'Hard Copy'... Rickie Lake'... Oh God, the '60 Minutes' interview.
CHIEF OF STAFF=>Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>My fellow Americans, citizens of the world, ladies and gentlemen of the press. At 7:09 A.M. Eastern Standard Time yesterday morning, American scientists detected a radio signal from space. This message was largely mathematical, and in spite of some of the headlines I've seen today, so far seems to be completely benign in nature. To better explain the extraordinary events of the last 24 hours, I'm turning you over to... Doctor David Drumlin.
DRUMLIN=>Good morning. In 1936 a very faint television signal transmitted the opening ceremonies of the Olympic games as a show of German superior technology. That signal left Earth at the speed of light and twenty-six years later arrived on Vega, which they then sent back to us hugely amplified. As evidence of intelligence this is indisputable --
DRUMLIN=>Whoever or whatever they are, they're clearly move advanced than we...
DRUMLIN=>... maybe only decades or centuries, maybe much further along than that...
ELLIE=>What...
LUNACHARSKY=>In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
ELLIE=>A third layer.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>Oh my God...
KITZ=>What is it?
ELLIE=>I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
KENT=>It's incredibly rich. We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>What does it say?
ELLIE=>It could be anything. The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
KITZ=>... instructions to acquaint us with their colonization procedures.
KENT=>Moses with a few billion new commandments...
KITZ=>Ms. President, in the interest of national security, I strongly recommend we militarize this project immediately --
ELLIE=>Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
KITZ=>If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
ELLIE=>That's terrific, but there's one problem: we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>Is that true?
DRUMLIN=>The only way would be if we had a radio telescope in orbit.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>We don't? Why don't we?
ELLIE=>Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>How soon will you be able to decode it?
LUNACHARSKY=>There's no way of knowing. Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
ELLIE=>Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>Well. That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
KITZ=>But --
PRESIDENT LASKER=>That's it, Mike. Last time I checked, I was still running the country. Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>Let's get out of here.
WOLF BLITZER=>... There had been speculation on the part of psychologists that the proliferation of depictions of aliens in movies and on television in recent years might make for an almost blase acceptance of the news.
WOLF BLITZER=>But the truth is, it turns out, is far stranger than anything Hollywood might have dreamed up -- and here, today, the prospect of extraterrestrial intelligence if no longer science fiction -- it's the best show in town.
VOICE=>... I know you're angry -- we're all angry. About the lies. The corruption. About the cancer of despair spreading through every aspect of our lives. But Rome will fall, my friends; everywhere now are the signs of closure. Even now the end begins.
JOSEPH=>The millennium is upon us. God has fulfilled his promise, sending us this herald to warn the faithless -- the scientists who tell us He doesn't even exist -- and to promise us, the faithful, we will be saved.
JOSEPH=>I don't know what this voice from the sky says -- but I do know that if history has taught us anything, it's that the politicians and the scientists are lying to us, right now, for their own good! Are these the kind of people you want talking to your God for you -- ?
DRUMLIN=>... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
ELLIE=>What? Why?
DRUMLIN=>The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
ELLIE=>With me.
DRUMLIN=>Apparently he's genuinely interested in science. This could be a chance to win him over.
ELLIE=>I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil? This is absurd, David. We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
DRUMLIN=>Ellie --
DRUMLIN=>I want you to listen to me, carefully. The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
ELLIE=>Are you threatening me?
DRUMLIN=>It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly. Play ball. Really. It's good advice.
ELLIE=>Excuse me.
ELLIE=>What?
LUNACHARSKY=>We've repeated. A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
ELLIE=>And?
LUNACHARSKY=>No primer.
ELLIE=>How can that be?
LUNACHARSKY=>I don't know. Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
BERNIE SHAW=>... And with church attendance at record highs, a coalition of religious leaders are using their increased political capital to challenge the very legality of radio astronomy itself, claiming the message and its contents subvert the moral climate of their constituencies. More after this...
COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER=>In the air, under the sea, in the depths of D.N.A. itself, Hadden Industries is at the frontier...
ELLIE=>Someone's broken into the system, someone's compromised the fucking -- !
MAJOR DOMO=>You should be flattered. He hardly lands for anyone.
HADDEN=>Dr. Arroway, I presume.
ELLIE=>S.R. Hadden... You compromised our security codes.
HADDEN=>Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer. Please, sit, Doctor. I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home. Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha? That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot. At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
ELLIE=>You live here.
HADDEN=>I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile. Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children... I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
ELLIE=>Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
HADDEN=>The infamous, unfashionable bluntness. You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
ELLIE=>What kind of deal?
HADDEN=>The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium. Perhaps you've noticed. Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
ELLIE=>I didn't realize I was out.
HADDEN=>Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat. I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it? The 'primer' that will make decryption possible... I've found it.
ELLIE=>You've... found it. What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
HADDEN=>I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway. There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
ELLIE=>If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
HADDEN=>That's my girl... Lights.
HADDEN=>Forgive the theatrics, it's a weakness.
HADDEN=>Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
ELLIE=>A page-break signal. A period.
HADDEN=>Not if you think like a Vegan.
ELLIE=>You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
HADDEN=>-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission. Heaven is the mustard seed.
ELLIE=>Holy shit...
HADDEN=>You'll like this part. A little flashy...
ELLIE=>Some kind of circuitry...?
HADDEN=>Very good, Doctor. I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
ELLIE=>A machine. But a machine that does what?
HADDEN=>That would seem to be the question of the hour. I want to build it, Doctor. Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
ELLIE=>And in return?
HADDEN=>In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game. Do we have a deal?
ELLIE=>Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But. If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
HADDEN=>That's my girl. Done.
ELLIE=>... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>A transport. So are they coming or are we going?
KITZ=>The transport theory is only one hypothesis, Ms. President, and in my view a rather naive one. It could just as easily be some kind of Trojan Horse. We build it and out pours the entire Vegan army.
ELLIE=>Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds. There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile. We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
DRUMLIN=>Interesting analogy. And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
KITZ=>I hope you're right, Doctor. But right now my job is to protect American lives from any plausible threat, and in that regard I have to assume the worst.
RICHARD RANK=>From a non-secular perspective, I'm forced to agree.
RANK=>My coalition's phone lines have been flooded with calls from concerned families, wondering if this message signifies the end of the world or the advent of the rapture. We feel that U.S. policy in this matter wants to be extremely conservative -- if there's any chance of danger or threat to our way of life perhaps the message and its contents should simply be disregarded.
ELLIE=>This is absurd.
RANK=>The Bible states that God made man in His own image. From everything I've been told it's highly unlikely the creatures who sent this message resemble human beings in any way, shape or form, ergo, they are not of God; and therefore by definition evil. My constituents simply want to know what their government plans to do to protect them --
ELLIE=>Ms. President, forgive me but I thought this was to be a serious discussion of policy and technical issues, not a war council against Satan's minions --
PRESIDENT LASKER=>Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
ELLIE=>Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists. If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
JOSS=>But a voice from the sky is just what you say you've found.
JOSS=>I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position. Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
ELLIE=>And where exactly does that put your position...?
JOSS=>I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet. For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>What's the status of the decryption effort?
ELLIE=>Well --
DRUMLIN=>We're continuing around the clock, but the amount of data is enormous. It's difficult to tell when we'll find the key that will tell us the machine's purpose -- maybe tomorrow, maybe next year, maybe never.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>I want to know the minute you find anything.
DRUMLIN=>Of course, Ms. President. We'll keep you fully informed.
DRUMLIN=>The President wants to discuss a few matters in private.
ELLIE=>But --
PETER=>Ellie.
ELLIE=>Peter.
PETER=>My wife Laura...
ELLIE/LAURA=>Nice to meet you.
PETER=>You look wonderful.
ELLIE=>You dress up pretty good yourself. How's... the baby?
LAURA=>Wonderful. She's almost four now.
ELLIE=>Really. Well. That's wonderful... Well. If you'll excuse me -- I'm paid to mingle... I don't believe I just said that.
PETER=>It's good to see you, Ellie.
ELLIE=>You too.
ELLIE=>Champagne please.
JOSS=>Make that two.
JOSS=>Want to fight some more?
ELLIE=>Yes.
JOSS=>... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years. You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics. It must have taken tremendous faith.
ELLIE=>I'd say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side.
JOSS=>And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
ELLIE=>I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
JOSS=>Spoken like a true believer.
ELLIE=>What about you? Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
JOSS=>How do you mean?
ELLIE=>Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
JOSS=>'My father's house has many mansions.'
ELLIE=>Very smooth. It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards. Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old. I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
JOSS=>Who was it who said -- it was a scientist I think -- that one's sophistication is determined by the ability to tolerate paradox -- to hold contradictory ideas at the same time...
JOSS=>... which I suppose is as good a definition of faith as any. Care to test yours?
JOSS=>It's okay. I'm a preacher.
JOSS=>Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
ELLIE=>That's not faith, it's physics. The second law of thermodynamics.
JOSS=>And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
ELLIE=>And mind, yes. What are you --
JOSS=>So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
ELLIE=>No.
JOSS=>Don't lean forward. Not even a hair.
ELLIE=>I flinched.
JOSS=>Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
ELLIE=>That's not doubt. That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct. I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
JOSS=>Now you know.
JOSS=>... It's an old story. I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets. By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time. By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that. One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking. Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked. I ended up collapsing in a wheat field. There was a storm... I woke up... And that's about as far as words'll go.
ELLIE=>Can you try?
JOSS=>I had... an experience. Of belonging. Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
ELLIE=>And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
JOSS=>Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent. But this experience went beyond both. For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
ELLIE=>You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something. But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real. Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
JOSS=>Do you love your parents?
ELLIE=>I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.
JOSS=>Did you love him?
ELLIE=>Yes. Very much.
JOSS=>Prove it.
ELLIE=>What is it? What's happened?
DRUMLIN=>We've cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.
ELLIE=>You mean --
DRUMLIN=>You were right, Ellie. You were right all along.
SECRETARY GENERAL=>A human has been summoned.
SECRETARY GENERAL=>Who will that person be? How will this ambassador be chosen?
INDIAN DELEGATE=>... of course none of us would be here if it weren't for the scientist who first discovered the history- making message and who has led this effort from the very beginning -- Dr. Eleanor Arroway --
ELLIE=>Um... thanks... Thanks very much. I'm not sure what I did to earn that response; I just happened to pick up the phone when they called.
BBC REPORTER=>... and as the curtain falls on the first day of the symposium the question remains: who will build this machine, if it indeed will be built -- and if it is, who will be selected as the Earth's first ambassador to another world. This is Marjorie Blake, B.B.C.3, at the U.N.
VOICE=>We're clear.
ELLIE=>David --
DRUMLIN=>Ellie.
ELLIE=>Do you have a minute -- ?
DRUMLIN=>Actually I'm running late --
ELLIE=>It'll just take a moment.
ELLIE=>David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
DRUMLIN=>I don't understand.
ELLIE=>I'm asking for your help, David. I want to go. They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist. As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
DRUMLIN=>Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
ELLIE=>What?
DRUMLIN=>As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
ELLIE=>You...
DRUMLIN=>Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>... And as our parents did a generation before us...
PRESIDENT LASKER=>... I believe we should dedicate ourselves, by the end of this decade -- to build this machine that our brothers from across the vastness of time and space have asked us to build -- !
PRESIDENT LASKER=>To meet with courage and determination the challenges of this new day -- !
PRESIDENT LASKER=>To greet with hope the dawn of this new Century!
PRESIDENT LASKER=>And to raise our voices to the heavens as one world, one people, in one ringing, defiant declaration -- bring on the millennium!
REPORTER=>I'm here with Peter Valerian, recently named David Drumlin's replacement as Science Advisor to the President. Doctor, there were loud complaints from the international community last week when it was announced that three of the ten candidates -- were to be Americans. How do you defend that decision?
PETER=>I believe the response was somewhat disingenuous; when it was determined that national interests would be represented on a pay for play basis it was understood that the U.S., by shouldering close to one third of the financial burden, would be entitled to commensurate representation.
REPORTER=>You've addressed the political side of the coin but what about the larger issues? On what basis do you choose a human being to represent humanity?
PETER=>It's a good question. Who do you send? An athlete? A religious leader? A philosopher? A soldier? If you don't know what the Olympic event will be, you send a decathlon champion --
REPORTER=>And if the event turns out to be chess?
PETER=>Yes... well, ultimately it was decided that the representative should be somebody fluent in the language the message was sent in -- science. If you'll excuse me --
CNN REPORTER=>... and if you look closely you can just see the superstructure beginning to take shape. Construction on this trillion dollar plus effort has been complicated by the nearly unprecedented scale...
JEAN-CLAUDE=>You realize how absurd this is. There are no precedents here; all training models are useless. Trying to turn us all into astronauts is a pathetic waste of time.
COMMANDER=>You know what, sir? You're right. We have no idea whatsoever what one of you may encounter. That leaves us with two options: we can sit around and do nothing and hope for the best, even if that includes a few things that feel a little silly. And if one of these 'silly' exercises ends up saving your life I'll have done my job.
PROJECT OFFICIAL=>How long now?
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Going on five hours.
PROJECT OFFICIAL=>Ugly little suckers.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Yeah. And those are only the ones that live on the human body.
NIGERIAN CANDIDATE=>... but even if somehow it has faster than light capacity it is still twenty-six years to get to Vega --
ELLIE=>That's from the point of view of someone on Earth -- from the traveler's point of view it'll only seem like two years...
RUSSELL=>... the fact is, nobody here knows what's gonna happen when one of us enters that thing. We can guess all we want, but in the end... we just don't know...
DRUMLIN=>... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
ELLIE=>... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
RUSSIAN CANDIDATE=>Based on what evidence? As far as we know all they know about us is what they've learned from watching three minutes of German television... even if they do not mean to do damage they may do so inadvertently. Look at the impact they've had on the world by simply sending the message...
ELLIE=>... we're not looking at this from their point of view. It's the first time this has happened to us but it's highly unlikely that's true for them as well. Chances are they've been doing this for thousands if not millions of years...
DRUMLIN=>They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
ELLIE=>Maybe they are. Maybe this is all part of the package. The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale. Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
JEAN-CLAUDE=>Very well. Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions. Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us. You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
ELLIE=>We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction. Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
ASSISTANT=>Sorry to bother you but they just got some tape in from Japan -- I think you're gonna want to see this.
FEMALE P.A. VOICE=>Component test C-4-90 commencing in T-minus three minutes. All personnel clear bay twelve; repeat, clear bay twelve --
TEAM LEADER=>This just came in from systems integrations in Hokkaido.
TEAM LEADER=>The chamber contains an exotic substance manufactured according to message specifications. In its normal state it appears as you see it, a transparent gas which is apparently breathable. As you'll see, it also has some other... unusual properties.
TEAM LEADER=>The substance appears to have intelligent multiphasic properties; able to shift states at will. We believe it may function as some sort of transport medium.
DRUMLIN=>Now I know why the Japanese gave up having a candidate in exchange for licensing rights...
ELLIE=>How does it work?
TEAM LEADER=>We have no idea. According to all known physical laws it shouldn't.
ELLIE=>Magic...
TEAM LEADER=>What you haven't seen is what occurred when a technician went into the chamber to retrieve the bullet... As I said, the substance had already been deemed breathable after extensive tests on laboratory animals.
DRUMLIN=>What happened?
TEAM LEADER=>There was apparently an aqueous residue covering part of the chamber floor. The technician slips. As he falls the substance hardens around him, breaking his fall...
TEAM LEADER=>... and solidifying in his lungs and bloodstream, killing him instantly.
ELLIE=>Maybe... maybe it was an anomalous reaction. Maybe when it's correctly integrated with other components of the machine...
TEAM LEADER=>Maybe. Unfortunately that's all we have is maybes, increasing exponentially every day. This machine is now building itself as much as we're building it. Almost as if it's growing, evolving...
TEAM LEADER=>It's scary, folks. We're like cavemen building a nuclear warhead. We are constructing the most advanced, dangerously powerful... whateveritis in the history of the planet and we don't have a fucking clue how we're doing it.
PROJECT LEADER=>Personal recording unit.
PROJECT LEADER=>Normal, infrared, ultraviolet, stereoscopic lenses, digital microchip good for thousands of hours of recording, state of the art, very tough, casting good to 15,000 degrees plus or minus.
DRUMLIN=>15,000 degrees... isn't that a little excessive?
PROJECT LEADER=>Well, sir... the thinking was...
PROJECT LEADER=>The thinking was that even if the passenger were to encounter conditions that were... extreme... there still might be a chance to retrieve the helmet.
PROJECT LEADER=>Lightweight, easily concealable...
PROJECT LEADER=>... and good for approximately one thousand uses.
ELLIE=>Does it dice and make julienne fries?
PROJECT OFFICIAL=>You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
ELLIE=>I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
PROJECT OFFICIAL=>It's designed purely as a defensive device. Call it a reasonable precaution.
ELLIE=>Call it xenophobic paranoia. Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this? This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
PROJECT OFFICIAL=>Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion. But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
ELLIE=>Y'know what? Fine. I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
PHYSICIAN=>Good morning, Dr. Arroway.
ELLIE=>Good morning.
PHYSICIAN=>We've been giving them to the astronauts since the first days of the Mercury program; of course it's never been made public. It's fast and painless. As soon as it hits the oral mucosa it starts to work -- a matter of seconds, really.
ELLIE=>You want me to travel all the way to Vega to commit suicide?
PHYSICIAN=>Doctor, despite your enduring faith that the civilization in question has only our best interests at heart, even you have to admit there's a possibility they might turn out to be... less than benign.
PHYSICIAN=>And even if they aren't, something else may go wrong. There may be an unforeseen mechanical failure. You may be marooned, unable to return. There are a thousand reasons we can think of for the occupant of the machine to have this with them -- but mostly it's for the reasons we can't think of.
REPORTER=>Say it again? What did you tell your daddy?
RUSSELL'S LITTLE GIRL=>I don't want you to go.
RUSSELL=>Nothing would give me more pride than to represent my country and my world. But what do you say to that?
JOSS=>You like to drive fast.
ELLIE=>So. Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
JOSS=>Some of my best friends are scientists.
ELLIE=>I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
JOSS=>Some of my best friends are scientists. They're saying the machine is alive.
ELLIE=>Not exactly. It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
JOSS=>Maybe you're creating a monster.
ELLIE=>I don't think so.
JOSS=>Why?
ELLIE=>It's too... elegant. The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
JOSS=>In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
ELLIE=>In other words.
JOSS=>Relativity. Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
ELLIE=>If you came back.
JOSS=>If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
ELLIE=>Something like that.
JOSS=>And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
ELLIE=>If you came back. If you survived at all. Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
JOSS=>You're willing to die for this.
ELLIE=>It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
ELLIE=>I read your book.
JOSS=>Really.
ELLIE=>Losing Faith: The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
JOSS=>What'd you think?
ELLIE=>I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
JOSS=>I won't deny I was ambitious. When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible. I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises. You didn't answer my question.
ELLIE=>I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt. And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
JOSS=>I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie. I'm not 'out to get' technology. I only ask the question: Does it have to have all the answers? I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
ELLIE=>Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
JOSS=>I don't follow.
ELLIE=>Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
JOSS=>Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
ELLIE=>I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
JOSS=>And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
ELLIE=>It's getting late...
JOSS=>What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
JOSS=>You're shaking. You're the paradox here, Ellie. So incredibly brilliant, and yet... What does it feel like to understand everything in the universe except yourself?
JOSS=>Ellie --
ELLIE=>It's late. We should go back.
REPORTER=>... With the machine nearing completion and final testing beginning next week, tomorrow's round of closed-door I.S.C. candidate interviews would bring to a close this long chapter of the machine drama...
ELLIE=>... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one. How did you do it? How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
JOSS=>An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don't like the answer?
ELLIE=>How do you mean?
JOSS=>What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy. A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social. The weak. The sick. The unwanted. And ever since we've been doing great.'
PROJECT OFFICIAL=>I think Reverend Joss raises an excellent point. I believe we should discuss the formation of a panel to review any potentially delicate communications before... am I amusing you, Dr. Arroway?
ELLIE=>You kill me, you really do. The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
PROJECT OFFICIAL=>How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
ELLIE=>I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks. But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
PROJECT OFFICIAL=>Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor. We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
ELLIE=>For managing the truth. But the truth won't be managed, sir. It stops being the truth the moment you try.
ELLIE=>I don't claim to be a perfect example of the human species... far from it. But I think, paradoxically, that's my strength as a candidate. Because I think we need to share the truth of who we are with them -- our strengths --
ELLIE=>-- and our weaknesses. To go to them openly, nakedly, and say these are our dreams, these are our fears. What I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen, is that I believe we should make this journey with honesty and integrity or not at all.
DRUMLIN=>Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you today not only as a scientist, but as a politician -- an occupation for which I make no apologies. With all due respect to Doctor Arroway's talk of naked honesty and integrity -- high ideals, to be sure -- I believe it would be foolish and, in fact, dangerous to ignore the fact that what we are dealing with here is a political situation -- the most political of situations -- and one that must be examined in that context.
DRUMLIN=>The image we put forth, the impressions we give may determine precedent for decades if not millennia to come.
DRUMLIN=>We must be optimistic enough to hope for the best -- and wise and experienced enough to prepare for the worst.
DRUMLIN=>Ladies and gentlemen. I'm proud of what we've achieved as a species and a civilization. I would hate to see all that we stand for, all that we've fought for for a thousand generations, slighted, taken advantage of, or God forbid, done in by the fact that at the final hour we chose to send a representative who didn't put our best interests first.
JEAN-CLAUDE=>I am become death; the destroyer of worlds. I wonder if this is how Oppenheimer felt on the eve of the first A-bomb test.
ELLIE=>I'd say this is slightly different.
JEAN-CLAUDE=>Perhaps. But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
ELLIE=>I thought you were here because you want to go.
JEAN-CLAUDE=>I do. More than anything. But I am also a realist. Soon this... what is your charming term -- ? Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
ELLIE=>You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
JEAN-CLAUDE=>I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor. Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning. You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort. The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans. Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no? This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone. It's good marketing. It's good casting. It's the American way.
KITZ=>It's not even close. Arroway may be a good, even great scientist, but she's politically tone-deaf and a loose cannon. She leaked the message without so much as a nod to the D.O.D. or N.S.C., and I don't think anybody here would say diplomacy's her strong suit. Drumlin may not be as glamorous a choice, but he's reliable, patriotic, sound. He has impeccable scientific credentials. And I think he'd be perceived by the public as the safer choice.
PETER=>It's her discovery, Ms. President. She deserves to go.
JOSS=>I've been watching and getting to know Eleanor Arroway for some time now... and I can say unequivocally, that I have never before met a human being with such extraordinary faith. In humanity... and in our right to a place of importance in the cosmos.
JOSS=>I believe that the person we're selecting will play a crucial role in humanity's future. I believe that when this person comes back -- if they come back -- they will be seen as being anointed by a higher intelligence, and may well emerge as one of the most important people on Earth. It may be true that Eleanor Arroway is not a perfect human being -- but I believe her honesty, her purity, and her integrity to be unimpeachable. Ms. President -- aren't those qualities that this representative should embody? Are we seriously considering choosing a man who openly claims that he stands for nothing more than political self-interest to be the one person to represent the human race?
SECRETARY GENERAL=>The International Selection Committee has come to a decision, ladies and gentlemen, and may I say, I think it has been a great oversight on the part of the Vegans not to build a few more seats on the boat... But only one human being can go, and that person, the person we feel best represents the world, is the candidate from the United States of America, Doctor David Drumlin.
DRUMLIN=>You aren't staying?
ELLIE=>This... seemed best.
DRUMLIN=>Right. Well.
ELLIE=>Good luck, David.
DRUMLIN=>Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race. That I would have told the President straight out: Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together. That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this. And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have. But that's not who I am. I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given... You do what you have to do. And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power. And it isn't fair...
ELLIE=>What would you have me say, David?
DRUMLIN=>Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.
ELLIE=>Thank you?
DRUMLIN=>For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
BARTENDER=>What can I get you, pretty lady?
ELLIE=>Beer, please.
ELLIE=>How far away are we from --
BARTENDER=>Two hundred miles.
JOSEPH=>What we do, we do for the good of all mankind. This will not be understood, not now, but the apocalypse to come will vindicate our faith...
HADDEN=>A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
ELLIE=>It's so... small.
HADDEN=>Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her. And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out. That's Paris, where my daughter was born. Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking. So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang. As if it never happened. If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
ELLIE=>What's that?
HADDEN=>Japanese squid fleet. They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
ELLIE=>It looks like pixie dust... Kent would've given anything to see this. David, too.
HADDEN=>Yes. A shame. Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
ELLIE=>What are you talking about? It's over.
HADDEN=>Oh, not quite yet. At least for their sake... ... I hope it's not. Because they're running out of time.
ELLIE=>You sound like Joseph. You think the world ends with the millennium?
HADDEN=>I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
ELLIE=>The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
HADDEN=>Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on
TV?=>Come; I want to show you something.
HADDEN=>Hokkaido Island.
ELLIE=>The systems integration site.
HADDEN=>Mmm. Look closer.
HADDEN=>As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time. You see my problem: I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it. So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract. Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
ELLIE=>-- of Hadden Industries.
HADDEN=>Want to take a ride?
ELLIE=>Why don't you come back with me?
HADDEN=>Can't. Doctor's orders. The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive. It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
HADDEN=>One more thing, Doctor. If you do meet these Vegans...? Ask them if we have to die.
REPORTER=>... it would be fair to say an upbeat atmosphere prevails here; the Japanese playing their role of host impeccably.
REPORTER=>And there is reason for optimism: the way the machine consortium has bounced back in these last few months is nothing short of miraculous, and that restored sense of hope and purpose is clearly in evidence here today.
REPORTER=>But look beneath the surface and you can clearly sense a darker mood here -- an undercurrent of apprehension and fear as tomorrow approaches. And questions: What awaits the world at the end of the long road to Hokkaido? What will happen when the machine is finally activated? And what must Eleanor Arroway be feeling on this, what may well be her last night on Planet Earth...?
JOSS=>You didn't think I was going to let you leave without saying good-bye...
JOSS=>Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
ELLIE=>I remember. You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
JOSS=>So. The final countdown.
ELLIE=>The final countdown.
JOSS=>Oh. I brought you something.
JOSS=>During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there. I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
ELLIE=>Thank you.
JOSS=>You're trembling.
ELLIE=>I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
JOSS=>Maybe that's okay.
JOSS=>What...?
ELLIE=>I'm sorry.
JOSS=>What is it?
JOSS=>Ellie, what is it?
ELLIE=>I'm sorry -- I can't --
JOSS=>What?
ELLIE=>I can't do this --
JOSS=>What are you so afraid of?
ELLIE=>Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
JOSS=>What are my other options? In fifty years? Never?
ELLIE=>Please --
JOSS=>I'm in love with you, Ellie.
ELLIE=>Don't you understand? I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
JOSS=>And then what? Then you'll be safe?
ELLIE=>-- I don't know --
JOSS=>Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor? Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
ELLIE=>I can't hear this now --
JOSS=>Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
ELLIE=>And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it? If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave. Now. Please.
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE=>Activation T-minus O-seven hundred and counting --
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE=>T-minus five minutes and counting.
ELLIE=>Someone tell me this is really happening.
PETER=>It's really happening.
ELLIE=>That you, Valerian?
PETER=>Like it or not.
ELLIE=>Like it. Almost there.
ELLIE=>That's one small step for a woman...
A.T.L.=>Arroway, this is command control; do you copy?
ELLIE=>Arroway to control; reading you five by five.
A.T.L.=>Showing green across the board. All systems go...
PETER=>What?
A.T.L.=>I'm not sure. We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
PETER=>Anything happening in there, El?
ELLIE=>Not so far -- but --
A.T.L.=>What the hell --
ELLIE=>Did you get that?
JOSS=>Look.
A.T.L.=>We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation. Control to Arroway, you okay in there? Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
PETER=>Ellie?
ELLIE=>Arroway to Control, come in. Arroway to Control, do you copy?
A.T.L.=>We've lost contact.
PETER=>Pull the plug. Get her out of there.
A.T.L.=>There's no plug to pull.
PETER=>What?
A.T.L.=>There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
ELLIE=>Control, I'm going to continue broadcasting on the assumption... hope... that you can hear me. The atmosphere within the chamber seems to be undergoing some sort of spontaneous state conversion...
ELLIE=>My breathing seems normal...
ELLIE=>What was that -- ?
ELLIE=>I'm falling... sense of enormous acceleration. It's a wormhole, it's got to be, but how do they keep it stable? The energy required --
ELLIE=>It's a star, I'm in orbit around a star, spectral type A, maybe early F. Getting weird multiple images here; relativity effects? Accretion disk... gotta be Vega, only... oh my God...
ELLIE=>They're talking to the whole universe... Okay, okay, clearly artificial, some sort of relay station but the scale is just... tens of thousands of receivers, hundreds... some sort of biotechnology, like the machine but... don't see anything like a docking port...
ELLIE=>Another wormhole? Bigger this time -- oh God --
ELLIE=>Okay. Okay. A series of wormholes, linked together, artificially created, but why would...? Jesus, it's a subway system.
ELLIE=>Quadruple system... incredible... don't recognize any background constellations... hundreds, possibly thousands of light years from Earth now. So beautiful. So...
ELLIE=>The physics must be a thousand, ten thousand years beyond us but... oh God... oh God something's... happening...
ELLIE=>It's beautiful. It's beautiful. I keep saying that but I can't... my mind can't... words... should've sent a poet. I'm a poet and don't know it... Ground control to Major Tom... Relativitistic side-effect? Or -- induced by the transport medium? The gas...
ELLIE=>Oh, Palmer, I wish I'd had a baby.
ELLIE=>The center of the galaxy...
ELLIE=>Docking ports... those are docking ports for other machines... hi, everybody...
ELLIE=>Now arriving Grand Central Station... floating down... floating... Twinkle twinkle... little star... how I wonder... ellemenopee... ... have to stay awake... stay awake... Please... please...
ELLIE=>I... remember this...
ELLIE=>Recording... check, check. Recording, is this on? I think this is on.
ELLIE=>Okay. I've traveled thirty thousand light years, give or take a few parsecs, to go to the beach. So... Either they've created this environment... or the illusion of this environment, to make me feel at home... or else somehow I am at home -- or else this is my cage at the intergalactic zoo and the tour bus will be along any minute...
ELLIE=>Or else, of course, I'm completely insane. This should not be discounted as a possibility -- although the fact that I'm questioning my sanity should be a pretty good indication that I am in fact sane... unless of course... unless...
TED=>Morning, Captain.
TED=>I've missed you.
ELLIE=>Dad...
TED=>It's okay...
ELLIE=>I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
TED=>I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
ELLIE=>Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
ELLIE=>You're not real. None of this is.
TED=>That's my scientist.
ELLIE=>So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
TED=>Am I artifact or dream? You might ask that about anything.
ELLIE=>But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...? When I was unconscious. You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even... This beach. I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined... Pensacola.
TED=>We thought this might make things a little easier.
TED=>... although this is nice too.
ELLIE=>So who -- what -- are you?
TED=>Originally just another species like yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but...
ELLIE=>Can you show me?
TED=>Small moves, Captain, small moves.
ELLIE=>Why did you contact us?
TED=>You contacted us. We were simply listening. We've been listening for millions of years.
ELLIE=>And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
TED=>Many others.
ELLIE=>And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
TED=>Oh, we didn't build it. The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
ELLIE=>So who...?
TED=>We don't know. Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
ELLIE=>The scale... it's just... So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
TED=>Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams. Some never make it this far.
ELLIE=>So we passed some kind of test?
TED=>You have your mother's hands... There are no tests, Ellie. We don't sit in judgment. Think of us more as... librarians. Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
TED=>As many civilizations as we've found, compared to the vastness of space...
TED=>... life is unspeakably rare. So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message. Sometimes we can offer help. Sometimes we can't. But we always try. Life is simply too precious not to.
ELLIE=>Can you help us?
TED=>You're an interesting species; an interesting mix. Capable of such exquisite dreams; such horrifying nightmares. Technologically you've advanced very quickly -- some think too quickly... and yet...
TED=>You're so lost. So cut off... and so sad.
DRUMLIN=>What is it that makes you so lonely, Miss Arroway?
PETER=>Be honest, El. The truth is you really don't want the company.
JOSS=>What does it feel like to understand everything in the universe except yourself?
JOSS=>Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
TED=>We are alone. For millions of years we've searched the cosmos... and after all the suffering, after all the chaos and desolation of the void -- the one thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other. That's why I sent the message. That's why I made contact.
ELLIE=>Who are you?
TED=>Am I one... or many?
ELLIE=>The librarian... or the library...?
ELLIE=>... all those voices... you gather them all together. Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
TED=>You always have been. We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie. All made of the same primordial atoms.
ELLIE=>So. What happens now?
TED=>Now... you go home.
ELLIE=>No! I mean... why so soon?
TED=>If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse. Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible. A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet. No offense.
ELLIE=>None taken... but ... do we get to come back? Others of my kind, I mean.
TED=>Eventually you'll get here on your own. This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
ELLIE=>But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
TED=>That isn't the way it works.
ELLIE=>But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
TED=>No more stalling, Captain.
ELLIE=>Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
TED=>Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
TED=>... but we'll consider your request.
TED=>It's time to go home now.
ELLIE=>No. Please.
TED=>Childhood is over, Ellie. It's time to grow up.
ELLIE=>No...
CONTROLLER=>-- Got her -- !
A.T.L.=>-- all benzel motion has ceased. Repeat, benzels are stopped; securing the area --
PETER=>Ellie -- are you okay?
ELLIE=>I'm -- I'm fine.
PETER=>Thank God. When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay. We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction. Did you notice anything at all that --
ELLIE=>Wait -- hold on a minute --
PETER=>It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
ELLIE=>Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction? What day is this?
PETER=>What day?
ELLIE=>How long was I gone?
PETER=>Ellie... we saw you enter the machine. The benzels spun up, generating some sort of atmospheric disturbance. The benzels spun down. And then... just now... you stepped out. We were out of radio contact exactly... seven minutes and thirty- five seconds. The machine never went anywhere.
DOCTOR=>Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms. Aching joints? Fever?
ELLIE=>I'm fine --
DOCTOR=>Headaches? Swollen glands?
ELLIE=>No -- could somebody please just --
DOCTOR=>Vitals identical to pre-launch stats.
ANOTHER SCIENTIST=>No sign of radiation or biological contamination of any kind. She's clean.
ELLIE=>Peter... What is going on? Has everyone gone completely insane?
PETER=>That's one way of putting it. Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe. Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
ELLIE=>But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone! The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at... ... the tape...
ELLIE=>... I don't understand it. All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
KITZ=>Is that your official response?
ELLIE=>I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.
KITZ=>I'm afraid that's not a satisfactory answer, Doctor. We spent two trillion dollars. You walked into that machine with the hopes and prayers of an entire planet with you, and you stepped out with nothing. Those people are going to want more than idle speculation and conjecture -- they're going to want answers -- and I hope for all our sakes you can come up with them.
SECRETARY=>I have Mr. Kitz for you Ms. President.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>Put him through. Well?
KITZ=>Nothing. Apparently the surface began to ossify immediately after she emerged; all subsequent attempts to re-enter the machine have failed...
KITZ=>... as have all attempts at internal analysis. We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>Recommendations?
KITZ=>I don't know. Maybe we built the damn thing wrong. Maybe it was all a hoax... The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
PRESIDENT LASKER=>Have your department make a full report.
JOSS=>Oh, Ellie...
ELLIE=>Hi.
JOSS=>Hi.
ELLIE=>I'm assuming you read my deposition.
JOSS=>It was quite a page turner.
ELLIE=>Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
ELLIE=>So. I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
JOSS=>I'm not sure it's come to that.
ELLIE=>They don't believe me.
JOSS=>I do.
ELLIE=>You're sure you want to? In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show. What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
JOSS=>It also makes God enormous. I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away. As it will everyone else's.
ELLIE=>I don't have any proof, Palmer.
JOSS=>Ellie, you're the proof. You tell them your story. Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
ELLIE=>It's not enough, don't you understand? I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
JOSS=>Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you! The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
ELLIE=>But --
JOSS=>Have you seen what's happening out there? The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie. People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
ELLIE=>I want to, Palmer -- more than anything. But it has to be real. It has to be true.
JOSS=>Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you. Please. For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth. Tell them it really happened.
AIDE=>They're ready for you.
SENATOR=>You were in the machine for seven minutes, thirty-five seconds, is that correct, Doctor?
ELLIE=>Earth time, yes.
SENATOR=>Earth time.
ELLIE=>Senator... I believe I traveled through a series of wormholes. Wormholes are a phenomenon deduced by Einstein; they're essentially tears in the fabric of space/time. Because of the effects of relativity what I experienced as a period of approximately eighteen hours passed almost instantaneously on Earth. To you I seemed to depart and arrive back at the same moment.
KITZ=>Doctor, isn't it true that wormholes are merely predictions of relativity theory? That there's no evidence they actually exist?
ELLIE=>There is no direct evidence, no.
KITZ=>And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
ELLIE=>I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
KITZ=>In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
ELLIE=>By our standards... yes.
CHAIRMAN=>... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you? As your father?
ELLIE=>Yes, sir.
CHAIRMAN=>He died... ... in 1972.
ELLIE=>Yes, sir.
CHAIRMAN=>Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
ELLIE=>Is it possible...?
CHAIRMAN=>All the elements are there. A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress. The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
KITZ=>Please answer the question, Doctor.
ELLIE=>Is it possible. Yes. But --
KITZ=>Thank you, Doctor. Now --
ELLIE=>-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
CHAIRMAN=>You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor. Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof? Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say? What was their intent?
ELLIE=>I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
CHAIRMAN=>Dr. Arroway, you come before us with no evidence. No records, no artifacts -- only a story that -- to put I mildly -- strains credibility. Over two trillion dollars was spent, hundreds of lives were lost, many more may be in jeopardy due to the almost incalculable worldwide psychological impact... Are you going to sit there and tell us that we should simply take this all on faith?
KITZ=>Answer the question, Doctor. As a scientist -- can you prove any of this?
ELLIE=>No.
KITZ=>So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
ELLIE=>Because I can't.
ELLIE=>I had... an experience. I can't prove it. I can't even explain it. All I can tell you is that everything I know as a human being, everything I am -- tells me that it was real.
ELLIE=>I was given something wonderful. Something that changed me. A vision of the universe that made it overwhelmingly clear just how tiny and insignificant -- and at the same time how rare and precious we all are. A vision... that tells us we belong to something greater than ourselves... that we're not -- that none of us -- is alone.
ELLIE=>I wish I could share it. I wish everyone, if only for a moment -- could feel that sense of awe, and humility... and hope. That continues to be my wish.
ZEALOT=>'... He dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the Earth, and the top of it reached to heaven... Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. This is none other but the House of God.'
PEOPLE=>Ellie... Bless me, Ellie... Heal me...
ELLIE=>I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
REPORTER=>Reverend Joss, do you think the failure of the machine is God's rebuke to science?
JOSS=>As a person of faith... I am bound by a different covenant than Dr. Arroway -- but I believe our goal is one and the same: the pursuit of the truth. I think today Dr. Arroway continued that pursuit under the most trying of conditions.
ELLIE=>... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer: Why would they send me back without proof?
JOSS=>Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said: ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
ELLIE=>In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
JOSS=>In other words.
ELLIE=>I don't know. If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one. It was still searching for meaning...
JOSS=>Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
ELLIE=>I'm not sure... Maybe it simply exists in the search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
JOSS=>Meaning...
ELLIE=>Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.' The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
BBC REPORTER=>... and while the riots here in London continue for the fourth night in a row, on the other side of the Atlantic the news is equally grim...
