EDVARDSEN INSTITUTE=>Bergen, Norway
DR. ASBJØRNSEN=>We’ve got it. It works.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN=>Subjects are placed under light sedation, and after a brief rest, perhaps some crackers and applesäft, fully recover within an hour or two.
PAUL=>What’s wrong?
ANESTHESIOLOGIST=>I’m surprised you’re still awake.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST=>So what’s your field, Paul?
AT A TABLE=>The guy carrying the box -- Dave Johnson’s younger brother ANDY -- sets it down and removes the top and front. Paul and Audrey join the onlookers, many of whom are taking photos with their phones. Dave and Carol walk out onto the table and speak through little hand-held MEGAPHONES.
CAROL=>Gin and tonic.
CAROL=>They make it really easy, and all the seats are first class...
THE KITCHEN=>-- where Paul is amid a heart-to-heart with Dave, seated atop a box of Ak-Mak Crackers. DAVE
PAUL=>Uh-oh. Honey?
LEISURELAND ESTATES=>GET READY FOR MORE!
AMONG THE EXHIBITS=>Audrey and Paul stroll through a maze of kiosks -- VACATION GETAWAYS, FINE DINING, RECREATION, INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION, TRAVEL SERVICES, JOB OPPORTUNITIES, STAYING IN TOUCH, SELLING YOUR CURRENT HOME, WHAT ABOUT MY PET?, WHEN YOU NEED A DOCTOR.
IN A TIDE POOL=>A horseshoe crab scuttles along, silent and primordial, passing a pair of rubber boots. Then we see the charismatic man inside those boots.
AUDREY=>Comfortable? That doesn’t sound like nearly enough.
PAUL=>Four dollars.
SOME OLD GUY=>I’ll give you a dollar.
MOTHER=>Where you from? PAUL
AUDREY=>We’re starving.
ADMINISTRATOR=>Paul, could you scoot over a little? That’s it. Perfect. With your permission I’m going to record your answers to the following questions. May I begin recording?
NURSE=>Paul Safranek?
AUDREY=>We’re together. NURSE
AUDREY=>I love you, too.
PAUL=>Where are you?
PAUL=>Are you at the airport?
AUDREY=>And see you all small? I’m upset enough already.
MATT=>Look familiar?
PAUL=>That’s the one.
PAUL=>Glad to help.
CAROL=>Ciao, bello!
PAUL=>Maybe some day. DAVE
DUSAN=>May I come in?
DUSAN=>Quoi, ma cherie?
PAUL=>One floor up.
PAUL=>Peace offering. DUSAN
DUSAN=>Just that in the small world no one wants to work.
PAUL=>I can relate.
PAUL=>Little Ronni? GUY
PAUL=>Little Ronni? Holy shit. That’s Little Ronni?
PAUL=>It’s me, Paul.
DUSAN=>Paul who? Who is Paul?
PAUL=>Naproxen. That’s an anti- inflammatory. It helps with pain and swelling.
NORMAL-SIZED TRAILERS=>of the sort used for portable classrooms or construction offices. Here they’ve been re-purposed into apartment buildings, with rows of tiny windows and crisscrossed bootleg wiring.
NGOC LAN=>Two? This lady very sick. Pills old. Give four.
PAUL=>You rest now. Gladys closes her eyes.
PAUL=>Here. Let’s move her.
WOMAN=>Cayenne, is that like red?
PAUL=>Where’s Gladys?
PAUL=>Too much water?
NGOC LAN=>Thank you, Roger.
DUSAN=>Okay, okay! I’m coming!
NGOC LAN=>Paul! No talk with Mr. Dusan! You go upstairs with Verónica!
ANNE-HELENE=>Yes. Jorgen has lost so much sleep over all the abuses. It’s such a pleasure to meet you at last. I just can’t tell you.
PAUL=>Yeah, that peg’s making the socket chafe a little.
SOLVEIG=>I’m sure of it.
PAUL=>Are you sure it was me? Because we’ve never --
SOLVEIG=>That’s really so sad. We’d love it if you’d join us.
DUSAN=>Of course it was. You’re always thinking ahead.
SOLVEIG=>That’s exactly what I told Jorgen. It’s Noah’s Ark!
DR. ASBJØRNSEN=>...the very survival of mankind rests in our hands. Yes, we are sad to leave, and terribly sad for the reasons why, but man is too beautiful, too improbable a life form to be allowed to disappear forever from the cosmos. It is no shame to look into the warm spring sun and regret a lost limb.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN=>I ask you again as I asked you so many years ago. Generations to come - - perhaps all of humanity -- will thank you for your bravery and commitment. But you must ask yourself whether you are truly ready to enter a new world. For there will be no turning back. Are you ready?
PAUL=>I’ve been here.
KONRAD=>It’s like a cult.
NGOC LAN=>Third host family.
LITTLE BOY=>Then what happened?
MELANIE=>Upstate New York.
