JACK=>It's six a.m.... Ooooooo and that bed never felt sooooo gooood... Mmmm, you linger in a warm, gentle dream
JACK=>... But suddenly you realize it's Monday!
JACK=>... your hand races to shut off the alarm before your mind wakes up...
JACK=>... But it's too late! If you don't get out of bed now, you'll never have enough time to blow dry your hair that special way... You'll never make that nine o'clock meeting that your partner will be early for... You will be late and everyone will notice!
JACK=>... Rumors will fly about you losing your edge... Someone will casually mention they saw you downing shots of tequila at the Xmas party and before you know it, you're spilling your guys to a Senate committee or selling yourself on street corners to middle aged men from the Midwest... Headlines flash across your mind -- "Sleeping Investment Banker Guns D.J. Then Self -- Claimed -- 'I only wanted two more minutes!'"
JACK=>... Hey, it's Monday morning, and I'm Jack Lucas.
WOMAN=>... I don't have to talk to you.
JACK=>Yes... Yes, you do because you see, today, you're our...
PRE-RECORDED ECHOING=>Spotlight Celebrity.
JACK=>And in the spirit of fairness, we want the public to hear your side of things. So, now... how long were you and Senator Peyton having this sleazy affair?
WOMAN=>I am tired of the public thinking they've got the right to invade a person's private life.
JACK=>Oh please!... You had sex with a United States Senator in the parking lot of Sea World... You're telling me you're a private kind of person. No... you're our...
PRE-RECORDED ECHOING=>Spotlight Celebrity...
JACK=>Because nobody cares about that, sweetheart. Nobody wants to hear about your romantic love. No. We want to hear about the back seats of limos... the ruined lives of people we want to be... new and exotic uses for champagne corks...
WOMAN=>Listen, I have been humiliated enough already!
JACK=>Perhaps not -- We need those details...
JACK AND CREW=>Ooooo...
JACK=>Hi, this is Jack Lucas and we're discussing personal pet peeves. Go ahead, caller.
CALLER=>Okay... well... It's my husband...
JACK=>Huh-huh.
CALLER=>He drives me crazy. I'll be talking and he'll never let me finish a sentence... He's always finishing my...
JACK=>-- Finishing your thoughts. That's awful.
CALLER=>Oh! It absolutely drives me...
JACK=>-- Drives you crazy, huh? The scoundrel.
CALLER=>Hello Jack. It's Edwin.
JACK AND CREW=>It's Edwin!!!!
JACK=>Edwin. We haven't heard from you in what -- a day?... I've missed you.
EDWIN=>I've missed you too, Jack.
JACK AND CREW=>Awwww.......!
JACK=>So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
EDWIN=>I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
JACK=>Yeah, I know the place. It's one of those chic yuppie gathering holes.
EDWIN=>Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
JACK=>Now, Edwin, if you start telling me you're in love again, I'm going to have to remind you of the time we made you propose to that check-out girl at Thrifty's that you liked so much. Remember her reaction...
BLACK SEVENTIES GROUP=>"Mister Big Stuff... Huh... Tell me... Who do you think you are... Mister Big Stuff... you're never gonna get my love..."
JACK=>Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
EDWIN=>I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
JACK=>Yeah, Edwin, sure... and Pinnochio is a true story... Edwin! Wake up! This is a fairytale...
EDWIN=>No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
JACK=>She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
EDWIN=>She likes me. She said for me to call!
MICHAEL MCDONALD=>"What a fool believes... He sees..."
EDWIN=>Jack!
JACK=>Edwin... Edwin... Edwin... I told you about these people. They only mate with their own kind. It's called Yuppie-In-Breeding... that's why so many of them are retarded and wear the same clothes. They're not human. They can't feel love. They can only negotiate love moments. They're
EDWIN=>Okay, Jack.
JACK LUCAS=>Well, folks... It's been a thrill, as always. "Have a perfect day"...
JACK=>Everyone here on the Jack Lucas Morning Show says "bye".
CREW=>Bye!
JACK=>This is Jack Lucas... So long... arriverderch... I'll be sure to send you a thought today as I lie in the backseat of my stretch limo, have sex with the teenager of my choice... And that thought will be: Thank God I'm me!
JACK=>(continuing; annoyed,
LOU=>You know some of this is very funny. Cheever told me they've even secured the rights to the Donna Summer song to play over the credits.
JACK=>Ooooo, I have chills... Are you sure they want me? I won't read unless I have an offer.
LOU=>Jack, of course... Not even a question. When I spoke to him on the phone this morning, I could actually smell how much they want you for it. I could smell it over the phone.
LOU=>I don't think I have any change.
JACK=>I am not opening this window.
JACK=>I hate my cheeks.
JACK=>Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
SONDRA=>You can ask.
SONDRA=>Raoul called before. About dinner.
JACK=>About dinner as a concept or about dinner with... Raoul?
SONDRA=>You're so witty. I'm so jealous... I need to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
JACK=>You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
SONDRA=>Fine. I'll say no.
JACK=>They're putting me on film tomorrow.
SONDRA=>Fine.
JACK=>... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to?
SONDRA=>Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
JACK=>I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.
SONDRA=>No, I have to work.
JACK=>How un-sixties of you.
SONDRA=>I was nine in the sixties.
JACK=>I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
SONDRA=>Jack, I have work to do too.
SONDRA=>...Can't we do this later?... All right..well..If we do this now, can I have dinner with Raoul?
JACK=>"Hey...for-...
JACK=>" HEY! Forgive MEEE!" .... ...FOR-GIVE-ME ... Hey...forgive me! I have this...I really have this...
JACK'S VOICE OVER=>"...everything America stands for. Edwin, they have to be stopped before it's too late.... It's us or them."
REPORTER=>It was Mr. Lucas's off-handed remark that seemed to have a fatal impact on Mr. Malnick...
REPORTER=>An after work hot spot, Babbitt's is popular with single young professionals.
REPORTER ON SCENE=>Edwin Malnick arrived at the peak hour of seven-fifteen, took one long look at the handsome collection of the city's best and brightest - then removed a shotgun from his overcoat and opened fire.
REPORTER=>Seven people were killed before Mr. Malnick ...
ANNE=>These people are insane today. They took insane pills...
ANNE=>Hey! Mr. Happiness!
ANNE=>Are we going to work today or what?
FRUMPY SECRETARY=>Can you help me!...
FRUMPY SECRETARY=>... I'm at an absolute loss. I've been looking for an hour -- I'm losing my mind. ... I'm sort of in the mood for a Katharine Hepburny, Cary Granty kinda thing -- Nothing heavy... I couldn't take heavy. Somethin' zany. I need zany.
FRUMPY SECRETARY=>...OH! OH! Do you have anything with that... comedian who's on that show? What's it - ON THAT RADIO! Ya know, the guy that says "HEY...FORGIVE ME...!
FRUMPY SECRETARY=>I get such a kick outta the way he says that...He's so adorable! Didn't he make a movie... I need something like that - a funny, no brainy kinda thing.
FRUMPY SECRETARY=>Great...
JACK=>It's kind of a - Big Titty- Spread Cheeky kinda thing...
ANNE=>...I'm sorry. I need to borrow him for a moment.
ANNE=>Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss? Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
JACK=>Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
ANNE=>Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
JACK=>Are you going for a specific look with this?
ANNE=>Well, it's funny! Whatta want from me?
JACK=>It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
ANNE=>Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
JACK=>Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
TV ACTOR=>Well forgiivvee meee...
ANNE=>You're a sick fuck... I don't know why you torture yourself. Too many thoughts -- too crowded in there. You should read a book.
JACK=>It's important to think. It's what separates us from lentils... and people who read books like... ... "Love's Flower Bed."
ANNE=>It happens to be a beautiful love story. Ya know, you used to like that about me. You used to say you liked that I
JACK=>Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
TV ACTOR=>I hope when I'm your age you're finally dead!
JACK=>Madness.
BUM=>Merry fucking Christmas... Happy fucking New Year!!
BOY=>Mr. Bum.
JACK=>Anybody here named Jimeny?
JACK=>You ever read any Nietzsche?...
JACK=>... Nieztsche says that there are two kinds of people in this world... People who are destined for greatness like... Walt Disney and... Hitler... and then there's the rest of us... He called us the Bungled and Botched. We get teased. We sometimes get close to greatness but we never get there. We're the expendable masses. We get pushed in front of trains... take poison aspirins... get gunned down in Dairy Queens...
JACK=>You wanna hear my new title for my biography, my little Italian friend... "It Was No Fucking Picnic - The Jack Lucas Story". Like it?... Just nod yes or no... "Il Nouva Esta Fuckin' Pinicko" -- You're a good kid... Just say no to drugs... Ya ever get the feeling sometimes... you're being punished for your sins...?
LEATHER=>What's going on?...
LEATHER=>I said what's going on? What are you doing here?
LEATHER=>You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
JACK=>I... I was just leaving.
LEATHER=>People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood. It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
JACK=>Yes... I... I agree...
LEATHER=>Good. You believe this drunk?
LEATHER=>.....Me neither.
JACK=>No...No please...!
FIGURE=>All hope abandon, ye who enter here!

LEATHER=>You advise us!
PARRY=>You're out numbered son.
LEATHER=>Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
PARRY=>Nothing! They can do nothing! Gentlemen!
WINDBREAKER=>Shit.
PARRY=>Son...There comes a time in every man's life...and you will learn this, if and when you become men...
PARRY=>....That there are only three things in this world ya need...
PARRY=>...Respect for all kinds of life, ....the love of one other person who you can trust and pork on a regular basis ...and a nice navy blazer...Oh, and one more thing....always... keep your eye.... on the ball!
LEATHER=>Ow...Ow....OW!
PARRY=>However, the ability to bean a shithead can be a fabulous advantage.
PARRY=>Are you all right?
LEATHER=>OWW...MAN...
JACK=>Please don't hurt me?
PARRY=>"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
LEATHER=>You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
PARRY=>You won't be alone for long.
JACK=>I need a drink.
PARRY=>I know a great place. ...UH...WARREN!
BUMS=>I like New York in June...How about-....
NO..GUYS...GUYS....=>They're so proud.
BLACK=>...There ain't no justice in life! There's just satisfaction. And the death penalty's just another violation of my constitutional right to satisfaction Goddamn it.
IRISHMAN=>I hate that.
HIPPIE=>So, you mean if somebody like, killed your mother, you wouldn't want him dead?
BLACK=>Sure I would. But I should get to kill him Goddamn it.
IRISHMAN=>He gets to kill him. That's democracy, see.
JACK=>This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
PARRY=>Great place huh?
PARRY=>AAAAHHHH!
IRISHMAN=>How are you tonight?
PARRY=>Fine John and you?
IRISHMAN=>Can't complain.
BLACK=>Crazy fuck.
HIPPY=>So what do you think of the death penalty?
IRISHMAN=>Death's definitely a penalty. Ain't no fucking gift. Life's too goddamn short.
JACK=>I better be going...
IRISHMAN=>Have a drink...don't be shy!
PARRY=>I think they like you.
JACK=>Oh no that's all-
BLACK=>DRINK! GODDAMN IT!
PARRY=>Would anyone like a fruit pie?
THREE BUMS=>No thank you...Too sweet...to fattening...Goddamn it.
HIPPY=>Man...Why did God invent mediocrity?
HIPPIE=>You were phenominal tonight, Parry. SUPER-BUM, man! Fucking Marvel Comics...
PARRY=>How are you feeling?
JACK=>Have I died?
PARRY=>Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
JACK=>If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
JACK=>Where am I?
PARRY=>My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry? Breakfast? A fruit pie perhaps?
JACK=>No... thanks... Listen --
PARRY=>My name is Parry.
JACK=>Hi... Where are my shoes?
PARRY=>They're -- -- What?
JACK=>Where -- ?
JACK=>What?!
PARRY=>Sshhhh!
PARRY=>I knew it! I knew it last night! I did too! He's the one!
PARRY=>... Can you keep a secret?
PARRY=>Do you know what the Little People just told me?
JACK=>The Little People?
PARRY=>They said you're The One.
JACK=>I'm the one what?
PARRY=>Oh shut up!!!
PARRY=>... I've got a right to say something. I mean, you're tying my hands here!
JACK=>I'm not... Now, where are those shoes...
PARRY=>Hheeyy!!
PARRY=>... You're frightening him!
PARRY=>... Do you know who I am?
JACK=>Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
PARRY=>Take a guess... Let him guess!! Tch.
JACK=>Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
PARRY=>No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no... I'm on a very special quest.
JACK=>A quest?
PARRY=>But I need help and they sent you.
JACK=>The Little...
JACK=>Him...?
PARRY=>God... I'm the janitor of God.
PARRY=>... They came to me about a year ago. I was sitting on the john having one of the most satisfying bowel movements -- you know the ones -- where you just see God... And I saw them... just floating around... hundreds of these... cute little fat people... And they spoke. They said "I" was chosen to help them get back something very important they lost. But my part might be very dangerous. I said "Whoah".... slow down... ya start hearing voices from floating little fat people that tell you you're on a mission for God and you wind up in a mini-series. Then they said "Look in Architecture Today, Feb '88... page 33..."
PARRY=>And there it was... plain as day.
JACK=>Langdon Carmichael?
JACK=>The Holy Grail? Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
PARRY=>I know! You can't imagine how surprised I was. Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
JACK=>Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile. And I'm not The One... I'm not any One...
JACK=>I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man. I really appreciate what you did for me. It was a very brave and noble thing...
PARRY=>Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
JACK=>I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
PARRY=>But I can't get it... He's...
PARRY=>He's out there... I don't know if... He's always out there, see... and...
PARRY=>See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
JACK=>Listen, forget the shoes. I'll just take a cab... Uh...
PARRY=>Parry.
JACK=>Parry... I'm Jack.
PARRY=>I know...
JACK=>Thanks... You can keep the doll.
PARRY=>Thanks a mill -- And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack. Give my love to the wife and kids.
JACK=>I'm not married.
PARRY=>Funny -- you look married.
FRANK=>Where you comin' from?!
JACK=>Uh... basement I think...
FRANK=>I tell him no visitors!!!
JACK=>Sorry... I...
WIFE=>Fraaaaankkk! Who's at the door?!
FRANK=>I'm talkin' to somebody. Ya gotta yell like a banshee?!!
WIFE=>It's just my manner!
FRANK=>What?
WIFE=>I said it's just my manner!!!
FRANK=>You a friend of Parry's?
JACK=>No... He is supposed to live there?
FRANK=>Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
JACK=>Tragedy?
FRANK=>....You must have heard about it. That nut who listened to the radio?
FRANK=>Parry's not his real name. His real name's Henry Sa....
ANNE=>..Listen. I understand about open relationships. Please. I was a teenager in the sixties after all....I understand!
ANNE=>....But when you care about somebody ya need more than an open relationship. Ya need a phone call.
ANNE=>WHAT!....
EMPLOYEE=>A guy wants to check out the pornos...
ANNE=>So send him back!
JACK=>I'm sorry.
ANNE=>I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
ANNE=>I can't tell you how distraught I was. All night long. What the hell happened?
JACK=>I was attacked.
ANNE=>What!
JACK=>Two kids tried to set me on fire.
ANNE=>Oh my God... What did they do! My God!!!
ANNE=>Are you almost done?!
BUSINESSMAN=>Well...
ANNE=>Whatta looking for -- a story!? Here... "Creamer Versus Creamer"... It won an award.
ANNE=>You were attacked. My God. Should I call a doctor! Did you call the police...
JACK=>No, I'm fine... really...
ANNE=>You're all right... you sure...
ANNE=>... So... where did you sleep last night?
JACK=>I... I stayed at a friend's. Listen, I --
ANNE=>Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets. None. And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me. Just tell me the truth.
JACK=>I'm not seeing anyone else. I really was attacked.
ANNE=>Okay. ... I love you...
ANNE=>... You don't have to say it back... although it wouldn't kill you. I'll cook tonight.
JACK=>You know what the Holy Grail is?
ANNE=>The Holy Grail? Yeah... I know that. It was like -- Jesus' juice glass.
ANNE=>Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
JACK=>You still believe in God?
ANNE=>Oh sure... Gotta believe in God. But I don't think God made man in his own image. No. 'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men. No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... Booooorring!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out... (Anne moves to him and
JACK=>... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
ANNE=>Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
JACK=>I don't think I'm up to it tonight...
JACK=>I had a very traumatic experience... I...
JACK=>I think I'm getting sick... I... I slept in a boiler room, Anne... I'm tired... I'm upset... I'm... just not in the mood!... Okay!
ANNE=>Whatsa matter, hon -- can't sleep?
JACK=>I tell you something, Anne. I really feel like I'm cursed.
ANNE=>Oh stop. Things will change. My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
JACK=>I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
ANNE=>You didn't kill anybody. Stop.
JACK=>I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
ANNE=>I know. I know, honey.
FRANK=>Can I help you?
JACK=>I'm... just looking for Parry...
FRANK=>He's not here.
JACK=>What did you say his name used to be?
FRANK=>Hospital said it would be better if we kept certain things away from him.
FRANK=>... That's his real name -- Henry Sagan. He was a teacher over at Columbia. They kept him in some mental place on Staten Island... He did not speak for over a year then all of a sudden, he starts talkin' only now he's this Parry guy.
FRANK=>...She was a beautiful girl. He was crazy about her.
PARRY=>"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
JACK=>Parry!
PARRY=>Hi Jack...
JACK=>Hi. Listen...I thought maybe you could use a-
PARRY=>COME ON!
PARRY=>She'll be back....
PARRY=>Isn't she a vision?
JACK=>Yeah, gorgeous...Look, I'm going. I just wanted to give you...
PARRY=>Let's go.
PARRY=>She loves dumplings. It's her
PARRY=>Isn't she sweet. She does that every time...
PARRY=>She buys a new book every two days.
PARRY=>She's into trash. Whadda you gonna do?
PARRY=>She's got a real sweet tooth. If anybody ever told me I'd be in love with a woman who eats Jawbreakers, I'd said they were nuts. But look at that jaw!
JACK=>Do you follow her every day?
PARRY=>Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
JACK=>What's her name?
PARRY=>I don't know.
JACK=>Why did you do that?
PARRY=>Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
PARRY=>Oh look! A cooler!
JACK=>Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
PARRY=>Fifty dollars?
JACK=>Here's another twenty. Will that do? I mean, what's it going to take!
PARRY=>No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
JACK=>That's O.K.
PARRY=>Can I take you to lunch?
JACK=>No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
BUM SELL!....SELL!....SELL!=>BUY!...BUY!...BUY!...
JACK=>HEY!!...HEY!
PARRY=>Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
JACK=>What are you doing? Give that back!
JACK=>But I gave it to you!
PARRY=>Well what am I gonna do with it?
JACK=>I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
PARRY=>You really want to help me?
PARRY=>Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
JACK=>You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
PARRY=>O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
JACK=>All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
PARRY=>Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
JACK=>Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
PARRY=>I don't need a job. I have a quest.
JACK=>I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
PARRY=>Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know
JACK=>No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
PARRY=>...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this. Isn't he fabulous!?
JACK=>Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
PARRY=>I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY... ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
JACK=>Will you shut-up!!!
PARRY=>You're a true friend.
JACK=>I'm not. Believe me. I'm scum.
PARRY=>You're a real honest to goodness good guy.
JACK=>I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a fly on shit...
PARRY=>That's why the Little People sent you. Just like magic.
JACK=>I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
PARRY=>So what? You going to help me?
JACK=>WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ... You know none of this is true - PARRY the Grail, the voices... Jack... There's a part of you that Come on...what are knows this isn't true. saying... I know who you are... I know who you are.. or who you were. You're acting really- You don't belong on the No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent Jack... man....you're a teacher... Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...
JACK=>Perry...you all right?
JACK=>Parry answer me...are you all right?
PARRY=>He knows who you are! He's afraid! I can tell!
JACK=>You're totally gone, aren't you?
PARRY=>We've got'em... come on!!!
JACK=>Jesus.
JACK=>What is going o-
JACK=>Oh...Oh...Oh God...I'm dying. I can't breath and I'm dying.
PARRY=>Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
JACK=>WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
PARRY=>I'm sorry Jack. I thought you saw him.
JACK=>SAW WHO!!?
PARRY=>The Red Knight!
JACK=>The Red...? You're totally gone, aren't you?
PARRY=>.....Do you hear that?! Oh "Heaven be praised, in giving me an opportunity, so soon of fulfilling the duties of my profession...These cries doubtless proceed from some miserable male or female, who stands in need of my immediate aid and protection"
JACK=>This is too hard.
GAY BUM=>GET AWAY! GET AWAY!!....
PARRY=>It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
GAY BUM=>NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
PARRY=>Come on now...You can't sit here.
GAY BUM=>NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me. Leave me alone!!
JACK=>Parry...
PARRY=>Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
GAY BUM=>Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
GAY BUM=>Leave me alone...I wanna go...
PARRY=>Will you get the other side. Jack?
JACK=>Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
PARRY=>Who?
JACK=>Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do...do you want to stay here?
GAY BUM=>Oh, yes, thank you - I really love bleeding in horseshit. How very Gandhiesque of you.
PARRY=>Will you watch him for a minute?
JACK=>Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
GAY BUM=>A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
JACK=>Where? Maybe we can.
GAY BUM=>No...no...we can't...we can't..
JACK=>Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
GAY BUM=>Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
GAY BUM=>I wanna die...I just wanna die...
BUM=>O.K..everyone know their parts... Here we go... "I like New York in June"...
YUPPIE=>"How about you..."
PARRY=>"I like a Gershwin tune..."
PARRY=>...Good!.... "I like to read good books"
BAG LADY=>Where the hell am I gonna put the children? Goddamn daughter-in-law! Comes into my house looking for dustballs! GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY DINING ROOM...you ingrate!
PARRY=>Tempo, people...tempo...
JACK=>Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
GAY BUM=>Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean? That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
PIZZA BOY=>Pizza!
JACK=>Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day. Are you going to be all right?
GAY BUM=>Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine... ....Thanks...You're a gem.
SID=>God Bless You... Have a nice day. Ya hear Jimmy Nickels got picked up yesterday...
JACK=>Oh yeah?
SID=>He got caught -- God bless... Have a safe trip home... -- Got caught pissin' on the bookstore. Man's a pig. No excuse for that. We're heading for social anarchy when people start pissing on bookstores!
JACK=>You'll never see her in this crowd.
SID=>Bless you.
JACK=>Asshole! Guy didn't even look at you.
SID=>He's paying so he don't have to look. What he doesn't know is, he's paying for a service. Guy goes to work every day and for eight hours, seven days a week, he bends over and gets it right up the ass till he can't stand...
SID=>... But one day, right before quitting time on Friday, his boss is going say something like "Say Bob -- come into my office and kiss my ass"... and Bob is going think -- "The hell with it! I don't care what happens. All I want right now is to see the expression on his face when I stab him with these pair of scissors"...
SID=>... But then he thinks of me -- "wait a minute!"... he says... "It's not so bad. At least I got two arms and two legs and I ain't beggin' for money." He puts down the scissors, and puckers up...
SID=>... I'm what you call a moral traffic light. It's like I'm saying "Red -- go no further."
SID=>Ah, Margaret.
SID=>You have to admit though... Like at 5:00 in Grand Central... Pretty breathtaking, don't cha think?
JACK=>It's such a great song.
PARRY=>It's a classic.
PARRY=>God. Just one night with her. I'd die happy.
ETHEL/LYDIA=>Got no sunshine, got no rain Still I think I'm a lucky dame I got the sun in the morning And the moon at night...
TONY ORLANDO=>Knock three times... on the ceiling if you want me... Twice on the pipes...
ANNE=>Ya fuckin' bastard. I don't need this... ... I Do Not Need This! A woman my age... I am a person. This is kid stuff. You come! You go! And all I
PARRY=>What a beautiful night.
JACK=>Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
PARRY=>Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
JACK=>Yes. I think that's very fair.
JACK=>.....What are you doing?
PARRY=>Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
JACK=>You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
PARRY=>Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze.
JACK=>NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts. This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
JACK=>..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
PARRY=>Who are you talking to Jack?
JACK=>YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
PARRY=>Bingo!
JACK=>They're not moving.
JACK=>What if some homophobic jogger runs by and kills us to get back at his overbearing father?
JACK=>"JACK LUCAS FOUND DEAD - BESIDE A DEAD NAKED MAN...THE TWO WERE DEAD...HIS COMPANION WAS NAKED"...I hate
PARRY=>Are there any questions?
JACK=>What?
PARRY=>Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God... ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail. Pretty soon, finding
JACK=>I'm so sorry.
PARRY=>The Fisher King myth has alot of derivations...I remember I was at this lecture in Princeton once - and there was this one speaker...Henry Sa... Henry...uh...Henry...
PARRY=>....What was I saying?
PARRY=>....What was I saying?
JACK=>How come you've never asked that girl for a date?
PARRY=>I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
JACK=>Parry, you don't have to earn a woman. It's the twentieth century.
PARRY=>Maybe, when we get the Grail...
JACK=>Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
PARRY=>Happily married, probably.
JACK=>Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
PARRY=>Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
JACK=>Sure...
JACK=>Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
RECEPTIONIST=>What girl? I didn't notice.
JACK=>Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
RECEPTIONIST=>Oh, Lydia!
JACK=>Lydia. Lydia what?
RECEPTIONIST=>God, I have no idea. She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea. I'll call her.
JACK=>No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
JACK=>Yes. Two Hearts Publishing? May I speak to Lydia please.
ANNE=>Can I have my desk please.
JACK=>Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
ANNE=>Lydia?! Lydia who!?
JACK=>I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
ANNE=>You're calling Lydia in my office. You must think I'm some dope. You fuckin' bastard... You... ... stay out all night long...
JACK=>What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
ANNE=>... I don't get a friggin' phone call. You stroll in here at noon. I got... two people out sick. Ya think I need this? I Do Not Need This!
JACK=>...Forget it... Goodbye!
JACK=>I was not with a woman last night. I was out with Parry.
ANNE=>The moron?
JACK=>He's not a moron.
ANNE=>And who's Lydia?
JACK=>Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
ANNE=>What? The curse'll be lifted? Will you please!
JACK=>I... You're not going to understand this.
ANNE=>Don't treat me like I'm stupid. It pisses me off.
JACK=>All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
ANNE=>What does that mean?
JACK=>See, I told you!
ANNE=>Well, what the hell does that mean?
JACK=>I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe... Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
ANNE=>Oh, you poor kid... You're a mess.
ANNE=>... Well, listen... stranger things have happened.
JACK=>Hello Lydia?
LYDIA=>Yeah? Who is this?
JACK=>This is Jack Lucas and I'm calling from Video Pop video rentals.
LYDIA=>Yes.
JACK=>Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not?
LYDIA=>Huh-huh.
JACK=>Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
LYDIA=>Which ones?
JACK=>All of them... Which means you have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
JACK=>Your name was picked.
LYDIA=>Well, I don't understand. What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
JACK=>A list.
LYDIA=>Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
JACK=>Well there.... What's the difference?
LYDIA=>Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
JACK=>You get a VCR with the membership. ... For a short time until you get your own. Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out. See if you're interested.
LYDIA=>Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
JACK=>No! I told you! You won a contest!
JACK=>....This is going to be rough.
GAY BUM=>I'm Anne Morrow Lindbergh and I can't find my baby...
BUSINESSMAN=>What?
GAY BUM=>See, I knew I could make you smile...
JACK=>Remember. One chorus and out.
GAY BUM=>I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
JACK=>I can't believe I'm on a first name basis with these people...
RECEPTIONIST=>Can I ... help you?
GAY BUM=>Is there a mousy woman who works here named Lydia?
RECEPTIONIST=>Yes..if you'll wait here I'll...
GAY BUM=>You MUST be SHE.
LYDIA=>Huh?
GAY BUM=>Jesus...
LYDIA=>Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
JACK=>Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
ANNE=>Hello....congratulations.
JACK=>And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
LYDIA=>Parry Parry?
PARRY=>No just Parry.
LYDIA=>Oh...like Moses.
LYDIA=>So how do we do this?
JACK=>Well..um...you get an official membership card... Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry? You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
JACK=>...Parry?
ANNE=>This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
LYDIA=>But now it's free, right?
ANNE=>Yeah.
LYDIA=>Now what?
JACK=>Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
LYDIA=>Free?
JACK=>Yes. They're free.
ANNE=>Only the first ten. After that they're 2.99 a rental.
PARRY=>... Can... can I help you?
LYDIA=>No. No... I can look myself...
PARRY=>How about the "Hell Merchants"?
LYDIA=>I don't like horror movies!
LYDIA=>I don't like... uh... Polish love stories... ... I like musicals.
PARRY=>Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
LYDIA=>Got any Ethel Merman?
PARRY=>... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
LYDIA=>What a gyp.
PARRY=>Yeah.
ANNE=>You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
LYDIA=>Well did you or didn't you?
ANNE=>Yes! They'll be in soon.
LYDIA=>Well, I guess I'll come back then.
JACK=>Here's your card.
LYDIA=>I like your nails. Where did you get them done?
ANNE=>Ah... I do them myself. I used to work in a beauty parlor.
LYDIA=>I like the stars.
JACK=>You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... (Anne is surprised to hear this. ... If you want, she could do your nails.
LYDIA=>How much?
JACK=>Well, since you're a member, we could...
ANNE=>Twenty dollars.
LYDIA=>Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
JACK=>Tonight! How's tonight?
ANNE=>Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and him... She didn't even look at him.
PARRY=>Got any more bread crust?
JACK=>We'll make it very casual... not like a date or anything. I just have to find something he'll look good in.
ANNE=>I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
JACK=>He just needs some clothes?
PARRY=>Got any more starchy food?
ANNE=>I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous. It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
PARRY=>This food's delicious. You're a wonderful cook. And you have a lovely home.
ANNE=>Jack, he's starting a conversation...
JACK=>Well talk back. He won't bite you.
ANNE=>Thank you very much.
PARRY=>Your welcome. You know, a beautiful woman like yourself -- your own business -- I'm surprised some guy doesn't snatch you up for his own.
ANNE=>You're surprised!... But I guess I just never met the right guy. Whatta gonna do?
PARRY=>I'm shocked. With a child bearing body like yours... ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
ANNE=>Most men are.
PARRY=>Why this is outrageous!...
PARRY=>... A woman of your value going to waste before my eyes.... Come on! I'm yours! Let's go! Come on -- let us go to that place of splendor in the grass.
ANNE=>Jack!
PARRY=>Holdin' my penis...
ANNE=>What are you, out of your mind!
PARRY=>Holdin' my penis...
JACK=>Parry! Close your pants...
PARRY=>You sure now?
PARRY=>... Well alright. But you let me know. You're too good a woman to go to waste.
JACK=>What are you -- a 40 in a jacket?
ANNE=>Hello... welcome... Come in.
LYDIA=>I've never been in an apartment above a store. You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
ANNE=>Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
LYDIA=>No, thank you.
LYDIA=>Will it hurt?
ANNE=>That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
ANNE=>...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
LYDIA=>My parents were divorced.
ANNE=>It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say, "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
ANNE=>...SO...anybody special in your life?
LYDIA=>Do I look like I have someone special?
ANNE=>Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
LYDIA=>Well, there's nobody special!
ANNE=>Fine.
LYDIA=>I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
ANNE=>What?
LYDIA=>Meeting ... people.
ANNE=>Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
LYDIA=>I never really...went through a... dating period.
ANNE=>It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
JACK=>Will you stand still so I can do this!
PARRY=>I'm sorry....I'm just so excited. You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
JACK=>In a bar called Hellfire.
PARRY=>Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
JACK=>No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
PARRY=>What are the other reasons?
JACK=>Survival.
PARRY=>You love her alot Jack. You're ... crazy about her...It's just that, sometimes, you're a little bit of an asshole.
LYDIA=>...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
ANNE=>I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
LYDIA=>I think some people are meant to be alone. Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
ANNE=>I don't understand you. What is the problem?
LYDIA=>I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time
ANNE=>That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
LYDIA=>I'm paying you.
ANNE=>You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
LYDIA=>Really?
ANNE=>Yeah!
JACK=>Come here...you're all crooked. Here's my wallet, so you can pay for dinner?
PARRY=>...You're a nice man, Jack. Doing all this for me...
PARRY=>I'm scared Jack.
PARRY=>...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
JACK=>No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
PARRY=>I'm still scared.
ANNE=>It's hard being a woman. I don't care what anybody says...People say we have choices - we have no choices...My grandma used to say that, for a woman in this world, behind every door there's either death...or husband.
LYDIA=>"Sister-in-law of death"...That's wonderful.
JACK=>Anne...! Oh hi? How's it going?
JACK=>Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
PARRY=>I know!
JACK=>Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner. Say!....Anybody up for Chinese? Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
LYDIA=>Oh, no..I have to get home...
ANNE=>The nails!! Watch the nails!!... Listen, you still have to eat.
LYDIA=>No really..I can't.
ANNE=>Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
ANNE, JACK, LYDIA, PARRY=>Fine.
LYDIA=>...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
PARRY=>It sounds exciting.
LYDIA=>Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
PARRY=>Well, you're calculating costs that could have an affect on whether or not the book is published and if it is, it could be a book that... ....might somehow change the way people think or act - a book can do that. And you would be a part of creating a cultural shift that could change our society forever.
JACK=>Parry!
LYDIA=>We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
PARRY=>Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
PARRY=>...Romance is romance no matter what kind it is...It could be a Victorian lady kidnapped by a viral sea captain with a hairy chest...or a horny pizza boy seduced by a housewife with a hairy upper lip. As long as there's heart, passion, and little bit of fantasy...romance is the stuff of dreams...there's always more to trash than meets the eye...
PARRY=>...Hey!
JACK/ANNE=>PARRY!
MARTIN=>Parry!...Parry - is that you!
PARRY=>Hey Martin...!
MARTIN=>Don't you look all duded up!
PARRY=>This is Lydia!
MARTIN=>Nice to meet you Lydia! Got a quarter?!
MARTIN=>Thank you. God bless... Nice girl...Have you set the date yet?
LYDIA=>How do you know him?
PARRY=>We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
PARRY=>Yep! Right on it!
ANNE=>Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
LYDIA=>What do you do - for a living I mean?
ANNE=>Oh..I could eat all of these
LYDIA=>Oh..god...
PARRY=>Oh boy...
PARRY=>Can't take us anywhere, huh?
JACK=>What do you think?
ANNE=>I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
LYDIA=>SMACK..SMACK...SMACK...
PARRY=>Lydia... Oh Lydia... That encyclopedia. Oh Lydia the tattooed lady...
PARRY=>Would it be all right... I mean would you mind... if I walked you home tonight?
ANNE=>I tell ya, I'm very surprised. She seemed to go for him. Hmmm... There's somebody for everybody, huh?
JACK=>You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
ANNE=>Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
JACK=>Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
ANNE=>Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
JACK=>You were great. Thanks alot.
ANNE=>Your welcome.
ANNE=>Oh my.
PARRY=>Tell me more. I want to know everything.
LYDIA=>There isn't any more to tell.
PARRY=>Don't say that.
LYDIA=>No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
PARRY=>Well, it's enough for me.
LYDIA=>You don't have to say that.
PARRY=>I never say anything I have to.
LYDIA=>I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
PARRY=>What are we about to do?
LYDIA=>Well... you're walking me home. I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
PARRY=>I don't drink coffee...
LYDIA=>... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll...
PARRY=>I don't drink coffee...
LYDIA=>And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch. Why am I putting myself through this? It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
PARRY=>Excuse me...
LYDIA=>Listen, I'm not feeling well.
PARRY=>Well, no wonder. We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
LYDIA=>Listen, you're very nice... b...
PARRY=>So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now... ... I'm not coming up to your apartment. That was never my idea.
LYDIA=>Oh... You mean you don't want to.
PARRY=>Oh no, I want to.
LYDIA=>You're married.
PARRY=>No.
LYDIA=>Divorced.
PARRY=>No, I...
LYDIA=>You have a disease.
PARRY=>Will you stop!... ... I'm in love with you...
PARRY=>... It's not just from tonight. I've known you for a long time. I see you come out of work every day. I walk with you to lunch. I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in... I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore... ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you. I love you. I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss. But I'll be back in the morning. And I won't be distant. And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink
LYDIA=>Shhh...
LYDIA=>You are real, aren't you?
LYDIA=>... You can call...
PARRY=>Let me have this.
PARRY=>Sstttoppp!!!
PARRY=>Come on!... Where are you!!! Where are you!! Where are you...
LEATHER=>... We're tired of looking at you people...
JACK=>... Well, ya know, I'm feeling good,
JACK=>I understand... I am... I won't... I will... Great! Thanks a lot, Lou... Tuesday's fine. Okay... Thanks...
ANNE=>So what's going on? Who's Lou again?
JACK=>My agent. I called my agent.
ANNE=>You're kidding! What did he say?
JACK=>He says if I want to get back to work, no problem. He wants me to come in and talk and... and... that's it!
ANNE=>Whoah! Oh, honey, that's terrific!
JACK=>I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned... ... There's coffee if you want...
ANNE=>It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
JACK=>Thanks.
ANNE=>Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
ANNE=>... I don't want to rush things -- you have to get a job first, but I'm so sure that's gonna happen I'm not even thinking about it.
JACK=>Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don't know where to begin...
ANNE=>... I would love to start looking at least. You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
ANNE=>... What?... You don't want to commute?
JACK=>No, it's not... Come here...
JACK=>You're an incredible woman Anne...
JACK=>What?
ANNE=>"I'm an incredible woman?" What is this, a death sentence?
JACK=>No, I... I think we should talk about this.
ANNE=>You want to talk? Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
JACK=>No... it's just...
JACK=>... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
ANNE=>Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we been going fast!?
JACK=>Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
ANNE=>I'm lost. What are you saying?
JACK=>It's been a real... real difficult time for me... The past year or so...
JACK=>... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
ANNE=>First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as we go, what time do you need? What have we been doing here, except time? Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
JACK=>No.
ANNE=>No. So what time do you need? I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great! I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that! So what do you need to figure out alone!?
ANNE=>All right. I'm going to ask you one question. Do you love me?
JACK=>I don't know.
JACK=>I didn't know. I just said all I want is some time.
ANNE=>Bullshit! If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
JACK=>All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
ANNE=>What have you been doing here! Huh! I wanna know! What have you been doing here?!
JACK=>Listen! We both got something out of it, all right!
ANNE=>Oh yeah? What did I get? What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week? You think your company is such a treat? Your moods, your... "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
JACK=>Then what do you want to stay with me for?
ANNE=>BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!...STUPID!...FUCKIN!...
ANNE=>No....You don't get to be nice now. I'm not gonna play some game with you where we act like friends so you can walk out here feeling good about yourself. I'm not a liar. If you're gonna leave me then that's what we call it.
JACK=>Hello?...Yeah...My wallet? What do you mean?.... What?....What?
JACK=>Parry?
DOCTOR=>He can't hear you. Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub.... I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand... ..."catatonic stupor"...condition rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
JACK=>Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right? He'll snap out of it?
DOCTOR=>I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
JACK=>But..How could that happen?
JACK=>What if I was a relative?
DOCTOR=>You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
ANNE=>Just like a guy. Finds the woman of his dreams then falls into a coma... Poor Lydia... ...Some women just have no luck, huh?
JACK=>Anne....Anne...I'll call you O.k...?
JACK=>Well, I'm gone-... Have a perfect weekend and remember on Monday, we have as our studio guest, Ben Starr - star of the recently defunct hit TV show
JACK=>Yeah...Yeah Lou.... Lou, I said I want an offer or they can forget it... Well, tell them I'm meeting with the cable people about a talk show and...What?... Beth's father set it up...No, he owns it. ...Fuck you Lou...And if the network is ready to make an offer and I see a script, then fine... otherwise, forget it...
BETH=>Hi...
JACK=>Hi..Did you talk to your father?
BETH=>Yeeesss...
JACK=>Weeellll!
JACK=>Great.
BETH=>Really. He thinks you'll be a phenominal success...and he says the cable people are very excited about the meeting... I said I always knew that and I really think it was like the first time he really respected me...So thank you for that.
BETH=>Jaaack...what are you crazy? They're people all around us?
BETH=>Jaack..I can't do this...
BETH=>What is this thing you have with the floor?
BETH=>Oh it's cold...I'm cold...honey... Jack, can we please do this after dinner.. in bed?...like normal people?...I really want you but I'll want you more, late. O.K. I promise.

T.V. EXEC.=>It's a weekly comedy about the homeless.
LOU=>Oooooo... I got a rush...
TV EXEC=>What?... Where is he... Lou, is this another disappearing act with this guy or what?
LOU=>I'm sure it's nothing... He probably had to go to the bathroom... I'll find out...
JACK=>Hey! Hey, guys!... Remember me...

IRISHMAN=>Move it, for Christ sakes. Move...!!!

LYDIA=>Excuse me but I brought new bed sheets for him last week. They were lime colored with little watermelons on them...
NURSE=>Oh yes... I'm sorry. They're being cleaned. The doctor had a little accident with a hypo.
LYDIA=>All right... Make sure he gets them, okay. Thank you.
JACK=>Hi!... It's Jack... How are you doing?... You look good... You do.
JACK=>... Hey... You gonna wake up for me? Huh?...
JACK=>... This isn't over is it?... You think you're going to make me do this, don't you?... Well, forget it! No fucking way!... I don't feel responsible for you, or
JACK=>... Everything's been going great! Great! I'm... I'm gonna have my own cable talk show, with an incredible equity I might add... I... I... have an... an incredibly gorgeous fucking girlfriend... I... I am living an incredible fucking life!!!... So don't lay there in your comfortable little coma and think I'm about to risk all of that because I feel responsible for you! I am not responsible! And I don't feel guilty... You've got it easy. I'm out there every day. Every day trying to figure out what the hell I'm doing... why, no matter what I have, it feels like I have nothing... So don't think I feel sorry for you! It's easy being nuts! Try being me!... So I won't do this. I do not believe in this. And don't give me that stuff about me being the one! There is nothing... Nothing special about me! I control my own destiny -- not some overweight fairies. I say what I'm going to do and I am not risking my life to get some fucking cup for some fucking vegetable... And even if I did do this, I want you to know it wouldn't be because I had to! It wouldn't be 'cause I feel guilty or cursed or .. or...bad or responsible or anything....
JACK=>Aw shit...If I do this...and I mean, IF!... It's because I want to do this...
JACK=>Thank God I live in a city where nobody looks up...
JACK=>What the hell am I doing? Can't fuckin believe this is my life! ... ... "Oh Jack you're the one...we have to get the Grail" I'll give ya Grail, ya stupid dingbat! Climbing up walls in the middle of the goddamn city- in the middle of the goddamn night while that schmuck lays in bed dreaming about Camelot! I live through this and I'll be the King of the Idiots...What a fucking honor!
JACK=>Oh great. This is great. I'm hearing horses now. Parry will be so pleased.
