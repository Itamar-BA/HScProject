JOY=>Stuart?… Are you okay?
STUART=>Yeah. Sure. I'm fine.
JOY=>Good. Well. I had a really nice time.
STUART=>Yeah. Me too.
JOY=>Of course, you know I've always had a nice time with you.
STUART=>Same here.
JOY=>But…
STUART=>Yeah.
JOY=>You understand.
STUART=>Unh.
JOY=>And you don't hate me?
STUART=>No.
JOY=>'Cause you know I could never hate you. At the same time, I just don't think I could ever…you know… you. In the way you should be…
STUART=>Yeah.
JOY=>And deserve to be.
STUART=>Unh hunh.
JOY=>Well. The food here was excellent– I'm gonna recommend it to my sisters! How many stars did it get?
STUART=>Three and a half.
JOY=>Do you feel better now? Me too.
STUART=>I'm sorry.
JOY=>It's really good we had this talk.
STUART=>Yeah.
JOY=>Before things went too far… You know, got too serious.
STUART=>Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm too serious.
JOY=>No, you're not. It's me.
STUART=>No, it's me.
JOY=>Okay. It's you. I'm sorry.
STUART=>Okay.
JOY=>'Cause I mean…
STUART=>I know.
JOY=>The thing is, I want to do what's right – for both of us. I spent a lot of time…examining…my heart. And I felt that you deserved my honesty.
STUART=>Thanks.
JOY=>Now I just want to make you whole again.
STUART=>I'm whole.
JOY=>Really?
STUART=>Really.
JOY=>…'Cause I was afraid we wouldn't be able to be friends anymore.
STUART=>Oh, Joy!
JOY=>Oh, but you know how it is. And well, most guys…
STUART=>I'm not most guys.
JOY=>I know. If only most guys were like you.
STUART=>But then I'd be like most guys.
JOY=>Oh, Stuart. If only I felt the way I'd like to feel with you… Life is so unfair. It's all my fault.
STUART=>I know. Are you sure…?
JOY=>Yes.
STUART=>Is it someone else?
JOY=>No, it's just you.
STUART=>I want to show you something I got for you.
JOY=>For me?
STUART=>Open it up.
JOY=>Oh, but Stuart. This is…oh, this is beautiful.
STUART=>Thanks. It's a Gainsevoort reproduction. Boston, late 1800's. I sent away for it just after we had our…first date.
JOY=>Oh, I just love it. It's a…it's a collector's item.
STUART=>Yeah, it is pretty special.
JOY=>It almost makes me want to start smoking again!
STUART=>Look at the bottom.
JOY=>Ooh.
STUART=>Forty karat gold-plate inlaid base.
JOY=>Oh, Stuart. Thank you. This really means something to me. I'll always treasure it…as a token…
STUART=>No, you won't. 'Cause this is for the girl who loves me. The girl who cares for me, for who I am, not what I look like. I wanted you to know what you'd be missing. You think I don't appreciate art. You think I don't understand fashion. You think I'm not hip. You think I'm pathetic, a nerd, a lard-ass fatso. You think I'm shit. Well, you're wrong. 'Cause I'm champagne. And you're shit. And till the day you die, you, not me, will always be shit.
JOY=>Well, good night.
STUART=>Good night.
ALLEN=>…I dunno, but whenever I see her I just want to…you know…I want to undress her, I want to tie her up and pump her pump pump pump till she screams bloody murder. And then I want to flip her ass over and pump her even more and so hard my dick shoots right through her and so that my come squirts out of her mouth… Not that I could ever actually…do that… Oh, if only she knew how I felt, how deep down I really cared for her, respected her, she would love me back. Maybe. But she hardly even knows I exist. I mean, she knows I exist – we are neighbors, we smile politely at each other… But I don't know how I could ever begin to really talk to her, what can I talk about? I have nothing to talk about. I'm boring. I know. I've been told before, so don't tell me it's not true. 'Cause it's a fact. I bore people. People look at me and they get bored. They listen to me and they zone out, bored… And for her to see how boring I am…no, no, no… It's better I say nothing… and hope… though right now, I have to say, if I were to suddenly jump out of my window, she wouldn't care. I mean, she'd care, of course, she'd care, I mean, she is human, but I mean she'd care the way you care about a stranger you read about in the paper that jumps in front of a running subway train, a stranger whose name you're never sure how to pronounce, if it's even printed. I'd be an anectode…maybe. But you know what I'm going to do? When I see her next time, as soon as I see her, I'm just going to tell her…tell her I find her…attractive. And that'll be that. Then…then we'll see…
ALLEN=>How's it going?
HELEN=>Okay.
ALLEN=>See ya.
HELEN=>Yeah.
ALLEN=>Hello, is this Claire?
WOMAN=>Who is this?
TRISH=>Oh, Timmy! Look who's here!
TIMMY=>Die, Aunt Joy! Die!
TRISH=>Timmy!
JOY=>Oh, leave him alone, Trish. He's just going through a phase.
TRISH=>Oh, I know, but…
JOY=>It's okay. I'm strong enough.
TRISH=>Oh, Joy, Joy. What's the matter?
JOY=>I don't know what it is, but I feel there's so much hostility directed at me.
TRISH=>Did another guy dump you?
JOY=>No! I…oh, I feel horrible.
TRISH=>Aww. Timmy didn't mean it.
JOY=>I'm sorry. I-I'm just overworked.
TRISH=>It's okay. Because now maybe you'll listen to me.
JOY=>What?
TRISH=>You've got to eat red meat.
JOY=>Oh, Trish…
TRISH=>Oh, I knew that's how you'd react, but it's true. I've been watching you and, well… My doctor says just once a month…
JOY=>I know…
TRISH=>Really. It's the best thing for the skin. It'll clear it all up.
JOY=>What's wrong with my skin?
TRISH=>It's fine now, but in another few years… Please, Joy. I'm speaking for your own good.
JOY=>Oh, I know. Thanks.
JOY=>I'm so happy.
TRISH=>Are you really?
JOY=>Being around you and the kids…
TRISH=>Oh… And I'm so happy you're happy. 'Cause all this time I've been thinking you were so miserable.
JOY=>Oh, Trish! That's too funny, when I couldn't be happier.
TRISH=>It's just, what with your music career never really…
JOY=>My career's fine!
TRISH=>Oh, I know, it will be! I just know it! And then you'll move out of Mom and Dad's…
JOY=>Real soon!
TRISH=>And you'll meet Mr. Right!
JOY=>Oh, I will. Already I feel I'm off to a fresh start!
TRISH=>That's right. Just because you've hit 30, doesn't mean you can't be fresh anymore.
JOY=>That's right.
TRISH=>You know, Joy, I've never told you this before, but now that we're older, and I feel so bonded to you, well…the truth is – oh, I know this sounds horrible, but I feel I have to be fully open with you, get beyond all the old barriers, sibling nonsense – well, the truth is I always thought you would never amount to much. That you'd end up alone, without a career or anything. Really, it's what we all thought. Mom, Dad, Helen…everyone… I'd always prayed we'd all be wrong, but you had always seemed to…doomed to failure. But now I see, it's not true. There is a glimmer of hope for you after all. Oh, I know I'm repeating myself, but, oh… I'm so happy for you…
VOICE=>And how is this different?
BILL=>I don't kill myself at the end.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Do you see this as something positive?
BILL=>Gee, I don't know.
PSYCHIATRIST=>How do you feel at the end?
BILL=>Much better. I wake up happy. Feeling good. But then I get very depressed because I'm living in reality.
PSYCHIATRIST=>And you wouldn't kill people in real life.
BILL=>No. I don't think so.
PSYCHIATRIST=>You don't sound so certain.
BILL=>I'm thinking about my patients.
PSYCHIATRIST=>What about them?
BILL=>My patients are ugly. Their problems are trite. Each one thinks he is unique. On a professional level they bore me. On a personal level I have no sympathy. They deserve what they get.
PSYCHIATRIST=>And what about your family?
BILL=>Trish is good to me.
PSYCHIATRIST=>But still no sex?
BILL=>No. But she's not too interested, either. So really there's no problem there, when you think about it, on a certain level.
TRISH=>So how was work today, Hon?
BILL=>Oh, fine.
TRISH=>Kooki, no!
BILL=>Down, Kooki!
BILL=>Hey, Billy! What's going on?
BILLY=>Nothing.
TRISH=>He's "depressed."
BILL=>Is something the matter?
BILLY=>I don't wanna talk about it.
TRISH=>Ignore him. He's just doing it for attention. He thinks you'll be impressed. As if. So anyway… Joy came by today.
BILL=>How's she doing?
TRISH=>Oh, God, I dunno, and frankly… I'm concerned. I mean, she's not like me. She doesn't "have it all." She pretends to be happy, but I can see right through her: she's miserable.
BILL=>Why do you think that is?
TRISH=>To be frank, I think she's lazy. She's not a go-getter, like me or Helen. And she's so picky. I gave Damien Ross her phone number, for what it's worth, and Joy sounded interested, naturally, but…I dunno. I'm afraid to have to say it, but truly it's what I believe: she'll always be alone.
BILL=>We're all alone.
TRISH=>Oh, Bill. Sometimes I wonder how any of your patients can talk to you.
BILL=>Sometimes I wonder if they'll ever stop. I should tape some for you.
TRISH=>Would you? Would you really? So that I could listen, too?
BILL=>No.
TRISH=>You're such a tease. You know I wouldn't tell anyone.
BILL=>I know. 'Cause you're so secretive.
TRISH=>Well, maybe not as secretive as you.
BILL=>What secret would you like me to tell you?
TRISH=>Like how come no matter how much you treat me like shit, I can't help loving you even more?
BILLY=>Dad?
BILL=>Yes, Billy?
BILLY=>What does come mean?
BILL=>Come?
BILLY=>You know…
BILL=>Well, you know how sometimes your penis gets erect…well, sometimes it gets so excited that a sticky milky substance shoots out.
BILLY=>…Dickwad?
BILL=>Yes, only come can be used as a verb as well. Billy?
BILLY=>Yeah?
BILL=>Have you ever come?
BILLY=>Yeah…
BILL=>Now Billy, it's alright if you haven't.
BILLY=>Well, I have…
BILL=>Billy…
BILLY=>But everyone else in class had and… I want to come, too!
BILL=>Awn, now, it's okay, it's okay. Have you tried playing with yourself?
BILLY=>You mean…
BILL=>With your penis.
BILLY=>A little.
BILL=>How did it feel?
BILLY=>I dunno. I don't know what to do.
BILL=>Do you want me to…show you?
BILLY=>No! No! I'm not normal!
BILL=>Aw, Billy. Don't worry. You're normal. You'll come. One day. You'll see.
HELEN=>Y'know, people were always putting New Jersey down. None of my friends can believe I live here. But that's because they don't get it: I'm living in a state of irony.
JOY=>Are you sure you don't wanna stay and have dinner with me?
HELEN=>I can't. I'm giving another reading/ book-signing over at Barnes & Noble, and then Jamal is taking me out – although I promised Fabiacho…Uch. Everybody wants me…
HELEN=>That's it, I'm going.
JOY=>Wait!
JOY=>Hello?
VOICE=>Hi! How are you?
JOY=>Is this Damien?
VOICE=>Yeah!… So, uh, how are you doing?
JOY=>Oh, fine. Could you hold a second? Helen?
HELEN=>See ya!
JOY=>Thanks for stopping by!
JOY=>Sorry. That was my sister leaving.
VOICE=>Oh. Yeah…um…yeah…
JOY=>So, um, Trish told me you might be calling.
VOICE=>Yeah, well…
JOY=>Oh, I know how weird these things can be, but I've always had such faith in Trish's judgment that I thought why not. It's not like I've got some huge social life. I mean, I do have a social life. It's just not huge.
VOICE=>Same here.
JOY=>Oh, really? That's so nice to hear. Most people seem so confident…
VOICE=>Yeah…
JOY=>Or, well, you know… They're just real jerks.
VOICE=>Yeah…uh… What are you doing?
JOY=>Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to thaw this steak…but it's so hard and… I'm sorry.
VOICE=>Oh, no. No. Don't stop. Not because of me.
JOY=>Oh, but I feel I'm being so rude.
VOICE=>No, no. Not at all.
JOY=>Thanks.
VOICE=>So…um… Are you alone now?
JOY=>Oh, yeah. Don't worry. Nobody's listening in. God, you're just like me.
VOICE=>What are you wearing?
JOY=>You mean, when we go out? Well, where do you want to go? I'm pretty easy to please. I hate getting all dressed up.
VOICE=>What are you wearing now?
JOY=>Oh, just a pair of jeans. Why?
VOICE=>Are they tight?
JOY=>Not too tight. They fit okay. But why do you…?
VOICE=>I don't mean the jeans. I mean underneath. What are you wearing underneath? Check.
JOY=>Underneath? Well, but Damien, underneath is just… This isn't Damien…is it?
VOICE=>Are you getting wet? Is your pussy all—?
ALLEN=>Who is it?
VOICES=>Your neighbor Kristina.
ALLEN=>Hey, what's up?
KRISTINA=>Did you hear what happened to Pedro?
ALLEN=>Pedro?
KRISTINA=>You know, the night doorman?
ALLEN=>Oh, yeah. What?
KRISTINA=>He was found bludgeoned to death in his apartment this morning.
ALLEN=>Uch.
KRISTINA=>Yeah. And supposedly his penis is missing.
ALLEN=>Uugh.
KRISTINA=>Yeah, well, Carla in 2B is collecting money for the funeral, if you feel like it. Apparently he had no family, no known friends…Gee, if I'da know… I mean, I did always say hi, I think.
ALLEN=>Me too, if it's the guy I'm thinking of.
KRISTINA=>By the way, um, I've got an extra ticket to the play-offs tonight. Wanna come with me?
ALLEN=>Nah. Thanks. I got too much work.
KRISTINA=>Oh. Well, anyway, I just thought I'd tell you about Pedro.
ALLEN=>Thanks.
KRISTINA=>See ya.
ALLEN=>Yeah.
MONA=>Oh, I feel better now.
LENNY=>Good. I'm gonna clean up.
MONA=>I'm gonna lie down.
LENNY=>I'm turning on the dishwasher!
MONA=>Where's my valium?!
LENNY=>What?!
MONA=>Nevermind! Fucking asshole.
MONA=>You answer it, Bastard.
LENNY=>It's Trish!
MONA=>Hi, Trish!
TRISH=>Hi, Mom. How are you?
MONA=>Oh, I'm fine. How are you?
TRISH=>Fine…
MONA=>Good.
TRISH=>Did you watch Leno last night?… Mom?
MONA=>He's leaving me! Your father's leaving me!
TRISH=>Mom, what are you talking about?
MONA=>Can you keep this secret? Top secret?
TRISH=>Yes, yes, of course, Mom, but –
MONA=>He says…he doesn't love me anymore.
TRISH=>Mom, I'm sure he doesn't mean it.
MONA=>Well, he does fucking mean it! He wants a divorce!
TRISH=>He said the word divorce?
MONA=>You don't believe me? Talk to him! Lenny!
LENNY=>Yeah?!
MONA=>It's Trish! She wants to talk to you!
LENNY=>Yeah, Trish?
TRISH=>Is it true what Mom said?
LENNY=>What?
TRISH=>You want a divorce?
LENNY=>I never used that word. Mona! What are you telling the kids?
LENNY=>She'll call you back. Did I use the word divorce?
MONA=>You said you didn't want to live with me anymore!
LENNY=>Answer my question: did I use the word divorce?
MONA=>You said you didn't love me anymore!
LENNY=>Did I say divorce?!
MONA=>…No.
LENNY=>Good. I just want that much clear. Now sit down now next to me.
MONA=>Leave it. The machine'll get it. It's probably Joy.
LENNY=>What if it's Helen?
JOY=>Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. It's Joy. Just called to say hi, but I guess you're out having a good time. Oh, well. I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Okay. Bye.
MONA=>Lenny?
LENNY=>Yeah?
MONA=>Why?
LENNY=>I dunno. I just want to be alone.
MONA=>But I can let you be alone more, if that's what you want.
LENNY=>Look: Things change… People change… Whatever. I want out.
MONA=>It's Diane.
LENNY=>Diane?
MONA=>You're in love with Diane Freed.
LENNY=>Get outta here.
MONA=>Well, you're in love with someone. Someone younger, probably.
LENNY=>Wrong.
MONA=>Lenny, it's okay. I'm not dumb. These things happen. I'll get over it. I just wish you had done this twenty years ago. Now I'll have to get another fucking face-lift.
LENNY=>I'm in love with no one else.
MONA=>No one?
LENNY=>No one.
MONA=>Okay, then. Schmuck.
JOY=>Hi! Is this Mrs. Mammangakis?… Hi! I'm calling from UniCard of America because you've been such a good customer that—.
ALLEN=>Hello?
JOY=>Hello, is this Mr. Mellencamp?
ALLEN=>Yes.
JOY=>Hi! I'm calling from UniCard of America because you've been such a good–.
ALLEN=>Do I know you?
JOY=>I'm sorry, I don't think so. But perhaps you're familiar with out—.
JOY=>Hello?
BERMAN=>Hello. This is Detective Berman from the County Police Department. I'd like to speak with a Ms. Joy Jordan?
JOY=>This is she.
BERMAN=>I'm sorry to disturb you, Ms. Jordan, but I'm afraid I have some bad news for you…
NANCY=>What's the matter, Joy?
JOY=>Stuart's dead!
NANCY=>Stuart…?
JOY=>Yes!
NANCY=>Who's Stuart?
JOY=>You know, the guy who used to sit over at the corner there?
NANCY=>You mean where Pam is sitting?
JOY=>Yes.
NANCY=>Was he kind of tall and a little hunched?
JOY=>No, he was…well…shortish, squarish…
NANCY=>Oh, Joy. I'm not sure. Did he work here long?
NANCY=>Kay, do you remember a guy named Stuart who used to work here over where Pam is now?
KAY=>No. Why? What happened?
NANCY=>He died.
KAY=>Huh. Now which one was he?
NANCY=>I'm not sure. May be Tom knows. Tom?
TOM=>Sorry, Nancy, I don't. I mean, I do vaguely remember some guy who worked over there – I think… but I'm not really sure.
KAY=>How did he die anyway?
NANCY=>Yeah, how did he die, Joy?
JOY=>Sales, can I help you?
VOICE=>Is this Joy Jordan?
JOY=>Yes.
VOICE=>This is Stuart's mother. I hope you fucking rot in hell.
TOM=>Hey, Joy. Was he kind of Latino- looking and a little acne-scarred?
NANCY=>Yeah, you know, like Edward James Olmos?
JOY=>Yeah. Sure. That's him.
TOM=>I knew it.
HELEN=>Uch. I don't know why I suggested this place. Joy recommended it…
TRISH=>Well, at least we're together. I never get to see you, you're so busy.
HELEN=>No, you're so busy.
TRISH=>No, you are…
HELEN=>Well, I guess I am.
TRISH=>Me too.
HELEN=>In fact, if I have to do one more interview…
TRISH=>I guess it's hard, all this success.
HELEN=>It's just I'm so tired of…of being admired all the time. All these men… I mean, they're all beautiful, artistic minds, great sex, the whole package…but hollow, you know what I mean? I feel nobody's really honest with me. Nobody wants me for me.
TRISH=>They're not family.
HELEN=>Oh, Trish. If only I had your husband, kids, carpool.
TRISH=>Well, I may "have it all," but sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if I'd actually tried to write a novel.
HELEN=>Oh, I'm sure it would have been good.
TRISH=>Maybe I will write one.
HELEN=>Oh, you should… Just try…
TRISH=>No, I don't need that kind of success.
HELEN=>Uch, listen to us. We who have everything while Joy… What does she have?
TRISH=>You're right. And she's just getting older.
HELEN=>Last night she called – I was in bed with Vilmos – no, Huraki – and she was in tears. She told me she'd quit her job…
TRISH=>Oh, but…but that's her lifeline!
HELEN=>She said she wanted to "change" her life. Do "good" work with the poor, the needy…
TRISH=>I don't get it.
HELEN=>Don't even try. She understand she already is good. She doesn't need to do good.
TRISH=>And what about her music career?
HELEN=>I don't know, but don't hold your breath. Anyway, listen. This is all top secret. She doesn't want anyone to know.
TRISH=>Oh. But she told you.
HELEN=>She felt she could trust me.
TRISH=>'Cause I always thought I was someone she could confide in.
TRISH=>Did you speak to Mom?
HELEN=>You mean about the split-up?
TRISH=>Oh. I-I thought it was top secret.
HELEN=>Just for Joy. Sensitive Joy. Everyone else knows.
TRISH=>Oh.
WAITER=>Can I help you with anything else?
HELEN=>Oh, no thanks.
HELEN=>Thanks for lunch. I really enjoyed this.
BILLY=>You can do it, Johnny!
JOE=>Don't fuck up, Johnny.
RONALD=>Let's beat him up afterwards.
BILLY=>C'mon Johnny!
JOE=>My kid is a fucking spaz.
BILLY=>Concentrate, Johnny! You can do it!
JOE=>You hit the fucking ball or I'm gonna smash your fucking face in.
JOE=>Bill, I dunno. Maybe I should talk to you. You're a specialist in these things, aren't you?
BILL=>Well, I don't know. That depends…
JOE=>Look, my son's a fag. I'm not blind to these things.
BILL=>How come you're so sure he's…gay?
JOE=>What, are you kidding?
BILL=>Well, it's just sometimes…appearances can be deceiving. And besides. Even if you're right. There's not much you can do, is there?
JOE=>What do you think would happen if I got him a professional…you know…
BILL=>A professional?
JOE=>Hooker. You know, the kind that can teach things…first-timers, you know…break him in.
BILL=>But Joe, he's 11.
JOE=>You're right, you're right. It's too late. He is…what he is. Forget I said anything.
BILL=>Maybe you ought to discuss it with Betty.
JOE=>I can't. I can't talk to her.
BILL=>Hmm. That's a problem.
JOE=>Things aren't too good between us…
BILL=>Not too good.
JOE=>No.
BILL=>Are you…?
JOE=>No. She's a dyke.
BILLY=>Dad, can Johnny sleep over tonight?
BILL=>Well, that's up to Joe here.
JOE=>Sure. Whatever.
JOHNNY AND BILLY=>Yeah!!!
JOE=>Like girls.
BILL=>Come and get it!
TRISH=>Oh, Bill. You shouldn't have.
BILL=>Here, take. You only live once.
BILL=>Aren't you having, Johnny?
JOHNNY=>No, thank you, Dr. Maplewood.
BILLY=>Johnny hates chocolate fudge.
BILL=>Well, is there something you'd like instead?
JOHNNY=>No, thank you.
BILL=>What about to drink?
TRISH=>Oh, leave him alone. He's fine.
BILL=>No, but there must be something…
JOHNNY=>Do you have any grape Hi C?
BILL=>Do we, Trish?
TRISH=>I'm afraid not.
BILL=>I could go pick some up.
TRISH=>Bill, don't be silly. He doesn't need anything. It's late.
JOHNNY=>Do you have any tuna salad?
BILL=>Would you like a sandwich?
JOHNNY=>Yes, please.
BILL=>Coming right up!
TRISH=>I'm going to bed, Bill.
BILL=>I'll be there soon.
TRISH=>Look at that Timmy, can hardly keep his eyes open. Come on, Timmy. You boys, don't stay up to late!
BILL=>Here we are!
JOHNNY=>Thanks, Dr. Maplewood.
BILL=>What happened to Billy?
JOHNNY=>I don't know. I guess he just conked out.
BILL=>Aren't you going to eat the sandwich?
JOHNNY=>In a minute.
BILL=>Take your time.
JOHNNY=>Dr. Maplewood, would it be alright if I ate this tomorrow?
BILL=>Well, sure, but I don't know if it's taste any good tomorrow.
BILL=>How is it?
JOHNNY=>Actually, it's really good.
BILL=>Enjoy it.
BILL=>Johnny? Johnny?
TRISH=>Oh, Honey. I feel so good now.
BILL=>Me too.
TRISH=>I haven't slept so well in so long.
BILL=>Me neither.
TRISH=>It's weird. I feel as if we… Bill, did we? I mean, did you… Did I…?
BILL=>Yes.
TRISH=>I don't remember…
BILL=>That's okay. It doesn't matter.
TRISH=>It matters.
BILL=>Forget about it.
TRISH=>Okay. It's funny, 'cause I remember I was dreaming and you were there… and Billy…and Timmy and Chloe… and Johnny Grasso…
BILL=>Oh?
TRISH=>I can't really remember anything more, except…I don't know. Oh, Bill. Please don't get mad at me. I know you hate it when I ask, but… Do you still?
BILL=>Oh.
TRISH=>Oh.
BILL=>Yes. Very very much.
TRISH=>Oh, Bill, and I do too! I'm sorry I need to keep being reminded, it's just…
BILL=>I know.
TRISH=>And we haven't been…
BILL=>I know. And it's my fault.
TRISH=>My fault.
BILL=>Trish, I—.
TRISH=>I know.
BILL=>No, I…I—.
TRISH=>Later.
BILL=>Where's Billy?
JOHNNY=>Watching TV.
BILL=>How come you're not playing together?
JOHNNY=>I don't know. Billy just said he didn't feel like it. Dr. Maplewood?
BILL=>Yes?
JOHNNY=>Can you drive me home now?
BILL=>Well, sure, but…are you having a good time?
JOHNNY=>I'm not feeling so well.
BILL=>What's the matter?
JOHNNY=>I don't know. I think—.
JOHNNY=>Dr. Maplewood?
BILL=>Yes, Johnny?
JOHNNY=>I'm sorry I threw up.
BILL=>Don't worry about it.
JOHNNY=>'Cause I really had a good time.
BILL=>Good. Billy did too. We all did.
JOHNNY=>Dr. Maplewood?
BILL=>Yes, Johnny?
JOHNNY=>You're so cool.
BILLY=>Dad?
BILL=>Yes, Billy?
BILLY=>I was kind of wondering.
BILL=>Yeah?
BILLY=>Nothing.
BILL=>Did you have a good time with Johnny?
BILLY=>It was okay. He's a little girlish though.
BILL=>Oh. Yeah.
BILLY=>Dad. Do you know how many inches your penis is?
BILL=>I never measured.
BILLY=>Ronald Farber said his penis is twelve inches long. Do you think that's possible?
BILL=>What Ronald Farber doesn't know is that it's not length, but width that matters.
BILLY=>Why?
BILL=>Things get a little more…tense.
BILLY=>What do you mean…tense?
BILL=>Have you been…practicing?
BILLY=>…Yeah. But it's no use. Nothing comes.
BILL=>You have to be patient. Your friend Ronald Farber, I can assure you, is full of crap.
BILLY=>Yeah. I bet yours is a lot wider and longer.
BILL=>Do you want me to measure?
BILLY=>Nah, that's okay.
SUPERVISOR=>You've come at a god time. The place is in turmoil now. Everyone's preparing to strike.
JOY=>W-why are they going to strike?
SUPERVISOR=>I can't tell you the half of it: the deceit, the corruption. The union wants to close down the school. They don't care about these poor immigrants. It's heartbreaking. Now I believe in unions, I'm sensitive to their needs, I cried at "The Grapes of Wrath", I sing to Woody Guthrie. But that was another time, another place. Today unions are just a new kind of corporation. It's tragic, but believe me, those teachers making sacrifices for the union, well, the union's not going to make any sacrifices for them. Those union leaders, they go home with pay-checks, the teachers end up with nothing. Now we need people who can be dedicated, who aren't in it just for the money. Because this job takes courage. Do you know what some of these refugees have endured? Concentration camps. And now their dream of coming to America is realized, and this union doesn't care. It's all about greed. Selfishness. Now Joy, can I count on you?
JOY=>O-of course…I want to do the right, um, thing…I mean, I believe in, um, you know…being counted on…
SUPERVISOR=>Do you know what these strikers are? Spoiled brats. Trust-funded artistes. They don't know the meaning of work, of giving… But just remember, if you hear the word "benefits," don't listen.
PICKETERS=>Don't cross the line! Don't cross the line!
JOY=>You know, there are some people in real need in there.
JOY=>But what about the refugees?
JOY=>I'm sorry. I think you're making a terrible mistake.
RHONDA=>It's so sad. I mean, it really is pathetic. Such losers. Really, I feel sorry for them.
JOY=>Good morning. My name is Joy Jordan.
JOY=>I am your new teacher. Now.
JOY=>Marsha? Well, Marsha…er…
BORIS=>Quiet!
BORIS=>Please.
JOY=>…I'm not a scab. I'm a strike-breaker.
HELEN=>I'm no good! I'm no good! I am nothing! Nothing! Zero!…
HELEN=>Hello?
HELEN=>…Hello?
ALLEN=>I know who you are and you are nothing. You think you are fucking something, but you are fucking nothing. You are empty. You are zero. You are a black hole, and I am going to fuck you so bad you're gonna be coming out of your ears.
HELEN=>…Richard?
ALLEN=>Data Resources.
HELEN=>Who are you?
ALLEN=>What do you want?
HELEN=>I want you to fuck me.
ALLEN=>I…um…I don't think I can do that… I mean…I don't think I can do that. I gotta go.
HELEN=>Call me tomorrow.
ALLEN=>…Okay.
CO-WORKER=>Hey, you see the play-offs last night?
ALLEN=>Yeah, pretty good! Pretty good!
ALLEN=>How's it going?
HELEN=>Okay.
ALLEN=>See ya.
HELEN=>Yeah.
ALLEN=>Who is it?
KRISTINA=>It's me. Kristina.
KRISTINA=>Hey, how's it going?
ALLEN=>Okay.
KRISTINA=>I got some more info on Pedro.
ALLEN=>Pedro?
KRISTINA=>You know…the, uh—.
ALLEN=>Oh, yeah. What?
KRISTINA=>Well, um… Say, uh, are you alright?
ALLEN=>No.
KRISTINA=>Here.
ALLEN=>…Pussy… Need pussy…
ALLEN=>What the fuck are you doing here?
ALLEN=>Get out!
ANN=>Hi. Ann Chambeau.
MONA=>Mona Jordan.
ANN=>Wonderful. Come this way. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
ANN=>Can I get you some tea? coffee?
MONA=>No, thank you.
ANN=>Okay. Now then. How can I help you?
MONA=>You said there might be something available over in Elysian Fields?
ANN=>Actually, there are several places we can see there. But first I need a little information. Now, you're looking for a one? two? three-bedroom?
MONA=>Three.
ANN=>Wonderful. Is this then for you and your husband?
MONA=>No.
ANN=>Just for yourself then?
MONA=>Yes.
ANN=>No children?
MONA=>My children are grown.
ANN=>No pets?
MONA=>No.
ANN=>So really just you alone then all by yourself?
MONA=>Yes.
ANN=>Wonderful.
ANN=>Mrs. Jordan? Is something the matter?
MONA=>My husband is leaving me.
ANN=>Oh, I'm so sorry.
ANN=>You know, we have a lot of divorcees in Phase IV. Would you like to see something there, perhaps a bit smaller?
MONA=>Who said I was getting divorced?
ANN=>You know, I'm a divorcee.
MONA=>Oh?
ANN=>I live in Phase IV.
MONA=>I am so sorry.
ANN=>Mrs. Jordan?
MONA=>Mona.
ANN=>Mona. That's a beautiful name.
MONA=>Er…thank you.
ANN=>How long were you married?
MONA=>Forty years.
ANN=>You know, Mona, I think we have a lot in common. More than you realize. See, I know what you're going through. I've been there. But I'd like to share a little secret with you: Divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me.
ANN=>Really.
ANN=>Don't worry. She's the exception to the rule. Most everyone here is much more youthful.
ANN=>See how they change the flowers every day. They don't wait for things to go bad and rot here.
ANN=>It was finished just a year and a half ago and they've really hardly spent any time here. Supposedly the third bathroom's never even been used. But I've flushed it, so I know it works.
ANN=>The views are spectacular, of course. But what's great is you can see the whole world and at the same time feel entirely alone. It's kind of a double bonus: you get the solitude you need for reflection and soul-searching and the thrill of being "top of the heap."
ANN=>Now they're asking 800. But I know I can definitely get it down to 650. I know this couple. They're also in the middle of The Big D. He needs to liquidate fast.
MONA=>I'll take it.
ANN=>Wonderful!
DIANE=>Hi, Lenny. Mind if I join you?
LENNY=>No.
DIANE=>How's Mona?
LENNY=>Fine.
DIANE=>Inside on such a beautiful day?
LENNY=>I dunno.
DIANE=>Whadya mean you dunno?
LENNY=>I dunno.
DIANE=>Eh. Whatever. So how are your girls doing?
LENNY=>Fine, I guess.
DIANE=>And the grandchildren? Coming to visit anytime soon?
LENNY=>I dunno.
DIANE=>It's good to have a family together. A close family…I know. And you know how I know. 'Cause you know I know what it's like when things aren't… together. When there is pain and loss and…separation. You know how I understand these things. Lenny, I just think you should know; I heard about you and Mona.
LENNY=>What?
DIANE=>About your…getting divorced. I'm very sorry.
LENNY=>We're not getting divorced.
DIANE=>Divorced, separated, whatever. It doesn't matter. You're alone now.
DIANE=>Anyway, if you ever need someone to talk to, I want you to know. I'm here. And I care.
JOHNNY=>Mom?
BETTY=>Yeah?
JOHNNY=>There's blood in my BM. Can I stay home from school today?
DETECTIVE=>How are you feeling?
JOHNNY=>Okay.
DETECTIVE=>You sure?
JOHNNY=>Yeah. I feel fine. Maybe a little sore. But I'm ready to go back to school.
DETECTIVE=>Good! Now, Johnny. I have to ask you a few questions. Is that okay?
JOHNNY=>Yeah.
DETECTIVE=>Good. Now then. When did you first start feeling sick?
JOHNNY=>Yesterday.
DETECTIVE=>What happened?
JOHNNY=>I threw up at my friend's house.
BETTY=>Johnny spent the night there. I thought he just had a little virus.
DETECTIVE=>Did you eat anything unusual?
JOHNNY=>No. Just a tuna sandwich.
BETTY=>He loves tuna salad.
DETECTIVE=>I see. And when did you first notice the blood?
JOHNNY=>When I went to the bathroom this morning.
DETECTIVE=>Now tell me – and it is very important that you be honest…
BETTY=>Don't be afraid, Baby. I'm right here with you. Daddy's not going to touch you.
DETECTIVE=>Is there anyone in the last day or two who…hurt you?
JOHNNY=>I don't think so.
DETECTIVE=>But someone did…hurt you. No?
JOHNNY=>No. No one hurt me.
JOE=>Whadya mean no?! You've been fucking raped!!
JOE=>Sorry.
BETTY=>Would you like me to fix you a tuna salad sandwich?
JOHNNY=>Okay.
TRISH=>More potatoes, Bill?
BILL=>Oh, no thanks. Mmm, I've got plenty.
TRISH=>The babysitter should be here any minute now.
BILL=>When does the PTA start?
TRISH=>We've still got half an hour.
BILL=>So how was school today?
BILLY=>Okay.
BILL=>Was Johnny there?
BILLY=>No.
TRISH=>I just hope none of you kids catch what he's got.
TRISH=>Very funny, Timmy. And now you are excused and can go right to bed.
TIMMY=>But Mom—!
TRISH=>Excuse me, Bill.
TRISH=>Hello?… Yes, is there a problem Tawny?… Well, thank you for giving me so much notice… Yes, well, I'm sorry, too. You should have thought of that earlier. Good-bye.
TRISH=>Bill, you're going to have to go yourself tonight.
BILL=>Isn't there anyone else you can get?
TRISH=>Not at this late hour.
TRISH=>Now you can come with me and take a bath.
TIMMY=>But I'm not finished!
BILLY=>Dad? If you and Mom died in a place crash, would it be alright f I took over?
BILL=>Well, probably one of your aunts would want to help out.
BILLY=>So you don't think I'm old enough to take care of myself and Timmy and Chloe.
BILL=>Well, no.
BILLY=>Ronald Farber's parents are away in Europe for a few days, and he's staying home alone without a babysitter. Why do I need a babysitter?
BILL=>Well, if you want to change Chloe's diapers…
BILLY=>If I didn't have any little brother or sister, would you let me stay alone by myself for a few days?
BILL=>Your Mom and I are not Mr. and Mrs. Farber. We worry. So no.
BILLY=>What if I were 12?
BILL=>No.
BILL=>At 13, I think you'll be okay.
BILLY=>Can you promise?
BILL=>As long as you don't still look like you're 11.
BILLY=>I won't.
BILL=>Okay. At 13, then.
BILL=>Hello, in Roseland, please. I'm looking for the address of a resident. The name is Farber… 12 Angel Court?… Thank you.
BILL=>Hello?
TRISH=>Hi, hon. It's me. Listen, I forgot to ask if you could pick up a half-gallon of skim milk on your way back from the meeting.
BILL=>Sure thing.
TRISH=>Thanks! Love ya!
BILL=>Love ya!
RONALD=>Hello?… Oh, hey, how's it going?… No, Billy Maplewood's selling me his… Five bucks, big deal… Yeah, I know, but Grasshole can't stay absent forever. He'll probably show up tomorrow… Yeah, he knows he's got it coming, he knows… Oh, okay. Yeah…Bye.
TRISH=>Hon, is that you?
BILL=>Yeah.
TRISH=>You remember the milk?
BILL=>Yeah.
TRISH=>How was the meeting?
BILL=>Okay.
TRISH=>Bill, are you alright?
BILL=>I think I have to lie down.
TRISH=>Oh, shit. I hope you're not coming down with whatever that Johnny boy had.
BILL=>I don't think so.
BILLY=>Dad?
BILL=>Yeah?
BILL=>Trish?… Trish?
TRISH=>…Mmmyeah?
BILL=>Do you love me?
TRISH=>Oh, Bill… Yes.
BILL=>I mean, do you really love me? No matter what.
TRISH=>No matter what…what?
BILL=>No matter what…whatever…
TRISH=>Bill. You have me. And you always will.
BILL=>I'm sick…
TRISH=>Aww… Take some Tylenol. You'll feel better tomorrow.
BORIS=>Joy! Joy! I am Boris! Your student1
JOY=>Oh, hello, Boris. How are you?
BORIS=>I am fine. How are you?
JOY=>Oh, fine, fine.
BORIS=>I not believe you.
JOY=>Really, Boris. I'm fine!
BORIS=>Where you are go now?
JOY=>Oh, I'm just on my way home.
BORIS=>Tell me where do you live. I take you home.
JOY=>No, no, I couldn't.
BORIS=>Joy. Come in my car. I want give you ride.
JOY=>But I like walking. And the train is right nearby.
BORIS=>No. No train. I drive you home.
JOY=>But Boris. I live in New Jersey!
BORIS=>Good. I take you New Jersey.
JOY=>Maybe you don't understand. Boris. New Jersey is far.
BORIS=>Joy. You not understand. I am driver. My taxi. You come. You understand? You come.
JOY=>Are you sure you know?
BORIS=>Boris knows. Come inside.
JOY=>I'm sorry.
BORIS=>Don't worry. Soon will be in New Jersey.
BORIS=>I love New Jersey.
JOY=>Don't you miss Russia?
BORIS=>Fuck the cunt of Russia.
JOY=>Well, I guess it's best to feel that way.
JOY=>Well, thank you very much. That really was very nice of you. I'm sorry about before…um…it's very unlike me… So do you think you'll need any help finding your way back?
BORIS=>Why you not married?
JOY=>Oh, Boris. Life is different in America. Here a woman can – I know this is hard to understand – but a woman can fulfill her potential. There are opportunities here to do something, do good…really improve the world.
BORIS=>Do you like men?
JOY=>Yes…but…it's not so simple.
BORIS=>Are you lesbian?
JOY=>No.
BORIS=>It is alright if you are lesbian. I like lesbians.
JOY=>I'm sorry, Boris. But I think this conversation has become a little strange for me. Thank you for the ride, and…um…
JOY=>Oh. Well…um…good night then. I guess I'll see you—.
JOY=>Would you like to come inside for a cup of tea?
BORIS=>Okay.
JOY=>I'll turn on the kettle.
JOY=>Yes, well…um…please take off your shoes. Make yourself comfortable.
JOY=>It's my parents' place. I plan on moving out soon, though.
BORIS=>How long you live here?
JOY=>Since I was born. But really, there are a lot of advantages to not moving. So what did you do in Russia?
BORIS=>I was thief.
JOY=>Oh. Do you mean…the mafia?
BORIS=>No. I am independent. I steal things on my own. Although I have many offers. You are musician?
JOY=>Oh, no, not really. I just write songs a little.
BORIS=>What kind songs?
JOY=>Oh, I don't know. They're all so terrible.
BORIS=>Love songs. Play. I play.
JOY=>Would you like to see my macrame collection? Come. Follow me.
BORIS=>You make?
JOY=>Uh huh.
BORIS=>All by yourself?
JOY=>Uh huh.
BORIS=>Beautiful.
JOY=>Thank you. I—I know it might seem childish, but sometimes I like to play with them and make up stories. These two here – I call them Chuckle and Giggle. They always make me laugh…
BORIS=>You should build store. Start business.
JOY=>Oh-h-h…
BORIS=>This? Two hundred dollars. Easy.
JOY=>Oh, but that's Punky! I could never sell Punky. I could never sell any of this.
BORIS=>Oh.
JOY=>Don't worry. They're all machine washable.
BORIS=>Ah. Machine washable.
JOY=>You know, your English is really very good. You should be in a higher level.
BORIS=>Your face is like love poem.
BORIS=>Do not be actress. Relax. Boris here.
BORIS=>…Okay.
JOY=>Okay?
BORIS=>I go now.
RHONDA=>How's it going?
JOY=>Oh, hi, Rhonda!
RHONDA=>Your students treating you okay?
JOY=>Oh, they're just…great! And already I'm seeing improvement! But you know, the funny thing is…I feel it's me who's doing the most learning.
RHONDA=>I know just what you mean. 'Cause teaching is really about learning.
JOY=>Yeah. But really I can't tell you how… gratifying it's been…I mean, I'm giving…and they're taking. I couldn't be happier.
RHONDA=>I hate to have to say this, but: I told you so.
JOY=>How about you? How's it going with your class?
RHONDA=>Oh, my students are just a hoot, always telling me how much they love me. But if you can keep a secret… There's this one Igor I've got such a crush on…
JOY=>Oh?
RHONDA=>Not that I'd ever…I mean, these Russians…
JOY=>What?
JOY=>Really? My students seem okay…
RHONDA=>Well, then, you are lucky.
JOY=>Yeah. I guess I'm lucky.
RHONDA=>You know, Joy, just between you and me, I actually think the quality of teaching has gone up since the strike began.
JOY=>Oh, well, I don't know. I just wish it were all over.
RHONDA=>Me too. But you know, once you're here and you're teaching, it's as if it doesn't even exist. You forget.
JOY=>Rhonda?
RHONDA=>Yes?
JOY=>If your Igor…
RHONDA=>…Used deodorant…
JOY=>Do you think…?
ZHENIA=>You teacher Boris?
JOY=>Er… Yes.
ZHENIA=>Whore!
RHONDA=>My God! That woman was nuts! Are you okay?
JOY=>Oh, fine… Thank you…
RHONDA=>Joy, you didn't…did you?
HELEN=>Thank you for calling me again. I'm sorry if I was a little bit… aggressive last time, but…I wasn't… prepared…and I'm not very good… on the phone… But U have to… meet you… Can we meet?…
ALLEN=>Who is it?
KRISTINA=>Kristina.
KRISTINA=>I'm sorry about last night.
ALLEN=>Yeah. Me too. I shouldn't have…um…
KRISTINA=>I understand. See, I can admit it. I'm fat…ugly…
ALLEN=>No, no…
KRISTINA=>Yes, yes…
KRISTINA=>Thanks.
ALLEN=>Say, you wanna go somewhere?
KRISTINA=>I have a confession to make.
ALLEN=>Oh?
KRISTINA=>Remember Pedro's penis?
ALLEN=>You mean, the one that was…cut off?
KRISTINA=>Yeah…well, it wasn't cut off.
ALLEN=>What happened to it?
KRISTINA=>Nothing.
ALLEN=>I—I don't understand. Why would you make something like that up? Was Pedro even killed?
ALLEN=>How do you know? What happened?
KRISTINA=>Well, I'd always been very friendly to him. I try to be that way with all the doormen, even if they're usually snickering behind my back. But I don't care, I'm still friendly. It's my way. Well, Pedro was different. Pedro never snickered. Of course, who was he to snicker? He wasn't exactly Tom Cruise. Still, he could have, and he didn't. Well, anyway, one night…
KRISTINA=>…I had just come back late from the 24-hour Pathmark…
PEDRO=>Good evening.
KRISTINA=>Hello, Pedro. Do you think you could help me with these bags?
PEDRO=>No problem.
KRISTINA=>Normally I don't need any help, but my back hurt and the bags were heavy. There was half-gallon of strawberry ice cream and a couple of boxes of fudge, a key lime pie… Really, I just couldn't wait to snuggle up under the covers and enjoy myself with the TV. You know…
KRISTINA=>It was in the elevator that I first got a funny feeling…like he was looking at me kind of funny…but I thought maybe he was just being friendly…
KRISTINA=>Well, thank you so much, Pedro.
PEDRO=>No problem.
KRISTINA=>But then he wouldn't move. I almost panicked, but then I realized he probably was just waiting for a tip. So I got out my purse…and then he surprised me.
PEDRO=>Forget about it. What I'd like is a scoop of this ice cream before going back down.
KRISTINA=>Well, isn't that nice and friendly, I thought. Thought I also thought, that's a little strange. I'm a little shy, you know, and also I had only one half-gallon. But he said, "Sure!" Well, then he sat down and started telling me about how he had no family, no friends… I started feeling really sorry for him…and I… Well, I guess I felt I shouldn't feel so superior. But then, all of a sudden, just as I was finishing scooping…
KRISTINA=>…He started…kissing me…more and more… and longer and deeper…it was horrible… horrible! Next thing I knew he tore off my dress, my…everything! …And he was climbing on top of me… He thought because I was fat and ugly I'd be…easy… that I…wanted it. I tried to fight him off, but he was too fast for me, and next thing I knew he was…inside me, pounding away. Oh, Allen!
WAITRESS=>All finished?
ALLEN=>Yeah.
KRISTINA=>I guess so.
WAITRESS=>Would you like to see a dessert menu?
KRISTINA=>What kind of ice cream do you have?
WAITRESS=>Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.
KRISTINA=>I'll just have a plain chocolate fudge sundae with strawberry ice cream.
WAITRESS=>And you, Sir?
ALLEN=>Just the check, please.
KRISTINA=>So anyway, everything suddenly got quiet and I thought, well, at least the worst is over.
PEDRO=>How do you feel now?
KRISTINA=>Kiss me again.
KRISTINA=>Well, of course, that was just an act. I let him kiss me one last time, and then…
KRISTINA=>…Grabbed hold of his neck and… twisted it…backwards.
WAITRESS=>Here you are.
KRISTINA=>Thank you. Anyway, so then I had to cut up his body, plastic bag all the parts… I've been throwing it out gradually ever since. There's still a little left in my freezer.
ALLEN=>So you did cut off his…
KRISTINA=>No, I left it attached. I didn't want to have to touch it again. Oh, I feel so terrible. You must think I'm a monster. But what else could I have done?… Anyway, I couldn't help myself. I hate…sex. I'm sorry, but just the idea of it…of someone all over…inside…me…I know it's not right, but… Can we still be…friends?
ALLEN=>Um… I guess… Yeah… I mean, we all have our…you know…pluses and minuses…
KRISTINA=>It was a crime of passion. I'm a passionate woman.
ALLEN=>Well…
KRISTINA=>I had a lovely time, Allen. Thank you. I hope we can do it again.
ALLEN=>Good night.
KRISTINA=>Good night.
KRISTINA=>Oh, and Allen!
ALLEN=>Yeah?
KRISTINA=>You're a very good dancer.
HELEN=>I've had you on auto-redial all night.
HELEN=>Hello?
HELEN=>Yes?
ALLEN=>I'm the one.
HELEN=>I'm the one. Oh.
HELEN=>Come in.
ALLEN=>Okay.
HELEN=>Drink?
ALLEN=>No…thanks.
HELEN=>This isn't working.
ALLEN=>No.
HELEN=>You're not my type.
ALLEN=>No.
HELEN=>I'm sorry.
ALLEN=>It's okay.
HELEN=>I made a mistake.
ALLEN=>Me too.
HELEN=>Good night.
ALLEN=>Good night.
LENNY=>Are you sure?
DOCTOR=>Look, you see this? You're the picture of health.
LENNY=>So no tumors.
DOCTOR=>Nope.
LENNY=>…And my heart?
DOCTOR=>Like an ox. Lenny. You're gonna live to a hundred.
LENNY=>Oh. That means I still have another 35 years.
DOCTOR=>Just stay off the salt!
LENNY=>You bet!
MONA=>I met with Steven Zimmer this morning.
LENNY=>You like him?
MONA=>Yeah. I'm gonna hire him.
LENNY=>Good. I'm gonna use Marty Blau.
MONA=>Good. I feel so much better now.
LENNY=>Yeah. It shouldn't take too long.
MONA=>Lenny?
LENNY=>Yeah?
MONA=>Can you sleep on the living room sofa?
LENNY=>Why?
MONA=>Steven Zimmer thought it would be a good idea.
LENNY=>Okay.
MONA=>Lenny?
LENNY=>Yeah?
MONA=>You don't have to sleep there. You can stay with me if you want.
LENNY=>Nah. It's okay. Good night.
MONA=>Good night.
LENNY=>Close the door behind you.
DIANE=>Oh, hello.
LENNY=>I thought I'd say hi.
DIANE=>Please come in.
DIANE=>Gin and tonic?
LENNY=>Okay. Thanks.
DIANE=>Uch, it's so bright outside. It gives me a headache just looking out the window.
LENNY=>It's supposed to rain tomorrow.
DIANE=>I don't want to talk about the weather.
LENNY=>Well, it was good for playing golf.
DIANE=>I hate that game. It's so slow and tedious.
LENNY=>Still, it passes time.
DIANE=>I like to travel.
LENNY=>I wen to Europe once.
DIANE=>Have you ever been to Tahiti?
LENNY=>No.
DIANE=>What about Tunisia? A night in Tunisia!
LENNY=>No.
DIANE=>Vincent never liked to travel.
LENNY=>I guess I'm like Vincent.
DIANE=>You know, when I was a child I always imagined I'd marry the man I fell in love with, have a son and daughter who loved me as much as I hated my mother, then die tragically and suddenly, young and beautiful. Later, when Vincent left me, I imagined I'd finally be happy.
LENNY=>I guess you've never lost your imagination.
DIANE=>Lenny, I've got to get out of here… I can't breath… The women are all… pathetic gossips…and the men…
LENNY=>…Just pathetic?
DIANE=>I don't want to die here.
LENNY=>You just don't want to die.
DIANE=>Not alone.
DIANE=>Don't. Don't feel guilty.
LENNY=>I don't. I don't feel anything.
BILL=>So how was school today?
BILLY=>Okay. Ronald Farber was absent.
BILL=>Oh?
BILLY=>He was afraid of the math test.
TRISH=>So he stayed home?
BILLY=>Yeah. He cut.
TRISH=>Oh, that's terrible. His parents…
BILLY=>They don't know yet. They're still on vacation.
TRISH=>Oh, are they gonna be upset.
BILLY=>Yeah, well, Ronald's gonna be upset when he finds out the test was cancelled.
BILL=>What happened?
BILLY=>Mrs. Paley was absent also.
TRISH=>Oh, gee!
BILL=>Did you call Ronald and tell him?
BILLY=>Yeah, but there was no answer.
TRISH=>So was Mrs. Paley sick, then?
BILLY=>Well, everyone says she was just too strung out.
TRISH=>Now why do people say things like that?
BILLY=>'Cause she's a drug addict.
TRISH=>And how do you know?
BILLY=>Mom. Everyone knows.
TRISH=>Well, I didn't know. Did you know, Bill?
BILL=>No.
BILLY=>Well, it's what everyone says: she's a junkie. And she's probably gonna be fired. It's really sad.
TRISH=>Well, if Mrs. Paley turns out, in fact, to be a junkie, then…she should be fired. Don't you think, Bill?
BILL=>I don't know. Don't you think that's a little harsh? I mean, if it's not affecting her work…
TRISH=>Well, apparently it is. And no, in fact, I don't think it's a little harsh at all. I'm sorry, but when it comes to drug abuse…and children, my children… Uch, they should all be locked up and throw away the key. I'm serious. And Billy, I want you to know, if you ever even think of doing drugs, and end up dying in a hospital…I'd disown you. That's how strongly I feel. Now I know, Bill, I may sound harsh, but we're talking about our kids. Not to be too grandiose, but this is the future, the future of our country we're talking about, after all.
TRISH=>I'll get it. Hello, who is this, pleas?… Oh, hi… Sure, hold on… It's Joe Grasso.
BILL=>Oh, great! Thanks! Hey, Joe! Whay's up? How's Johnny doing?
JOE=>You're a dead man.
BILL=>Oh, good, good… No problem!… Right… Okay. Well, take care… Bye!
TRISH=>How's Johnny doing?
BILL=>Oh, fine, fine! Much better!
TRISH=>Now who could that be?
BILL=>I'll get it.
BILL=>Who is it?
VOICE=>Police officer.
BILL=>Can I help you?
DETECTIVE=>Are you William Maplewood?
BILL=>Y-yes.
DETECTIVE=>Sorry to disturb you, but we have some questions for you and your wife. It has to do with your son's friend, Johnny Grasso.
BILL=>Did something…? Come this way. We're just finishing dinner, but I—I'll be right with you.
TRISH=>Bill, who is it?
BILL=>You take care of the kids.
BILL=>Sorry. Now…um…you said something about Ronald Farber?
BILL=>I'm sorry…er…I mean…I mean, Johnny Grasso?
JOHNNY=>You're so cool.
TRISH=>Bill? Are you alright?
BILL=>…Don't leave me…Please don't leave me…
TRISH=>One second! Hurry up, Billy! The bus is here!
PSYCHIATRIST=>Beautiful.
PSYCHIATRIST=>That's a beautiful dream.
BILL=>Thank you. I take it as a sign.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Of…
BILL=>Trish and I are thinking of moving. Out into the country. The real country.
PSYCHIATRIST=>How are things between you and Trish?
BILL=>Never better.
PSYCHIATRIST=>Oh?
BILL=>I don't know what happened, but all of a sudden, one night last week we were watching TV and…she turned me on. The kids went to bed and…we fucked. And on the weekend… in the morning, too…we fucked. My life is just one big fuck!
PSYCHIATRIST=>I'm happy to hear that.
BILL=>Thanks. But you know it's strange… I mean how like…now…just like that… everything's normalized.
BILL=>Well.
PSYCHIATRIST=>There's still ten minutes. Nothing more you want to discuss?
BILL=>No, I guess not. Everything's fine.
BILL=>Was that you?
PSYCHIATRIST=>Yeah.
BILL=>Hmmmph. You've changed.
BILLY=>Dad?
BILL=>Yes, Billy?
BILLY=>Everyone at school is saying things about you.
BILL=>Who is everyone?
BILLY=>Kids. You know. Everyone.
BILL=>What are they saying?
BILLY=>That you're a serial rapist.
BILL=>Oh.
BILLY=>And a pervert.
BILL=>You mean, like what they painted on the house?
BILLY=>Dad…did you…did you…with Johnny Grasso and Ronald Farber…?
BILL=>Yes.
BILLY=>What did you…do?
BILL=>I…I touched them…
BILLY=>Whadya mean exactly…touched…?
BILL=>I…fondled them.
BILLY=>What for?
BILL=>I couldn't help myself.
BILLY=>What else?
BILL=>I unzipped myself…
BILLY=>Do you mean…masturbated?
BILL=>No.
BILLY=>Then…what?
BILL=>I…made love…
BILLY=>What does that…mean?
BILL=>I fucked them.
BILLY=>What was it like?
BILL=>It was…great.
BILLY=>Would you do it again?
BILL=>Yes.
BILLY=>Would you ever fuck me?
BILL=>No…I jerk off instead.
BILL=>It's true: I'm a pervert.

BORIS=>But I very ashamed.
JOY=>I'm sure I'll understand.
BORIS=>Okay. Can I borrow money?

BORIS=>New Jersey is America! I give you back Monday.
JOY=>That's okay. I won't be there, anyway.
BORIS=>Why no?
JOY=>I don't know, but for some reason… now I have more sympathy for the strikers. See ya.
BORIS=>Stupid American.
HELEN=>…Anyway, so the police came and looked in her freezer and found baggies filled with the super's genitals.
MONA=>I use baggies.
JOY=>Me too.
HELEN=>Everyone uses baggies. That's why we can all relate to the crime. Don't you see?
TRISH=>I can't relate to it.
HELEN=>…In any case, there's a guy I've met, Joy, that I think you'd like. He's into computers, I think,
JOY=>How do you know him?
HELEN=>He's another neighbor of mine. Do you wanna call him, or should I give him your number?
JOY=>I'll call him.
HELEN=>Oh, great. I know he'd really like that.
TRISH=>What about me?
HELEN=>I'm looking, I'm looking.
TRISH=>I like computers.
HELEN=>Trish, trust me on this one: not for you.
MONA=>And what about me?
HELEN=>Mom, I haven't forgotten. It's just it's hard. But I am looking for everyone.
LENNY=>Don't look for me.
HELEN=>Have you found someone?
LENNY=>No. There is no one.
MONA=>I heard Diane Fred had a stroke.
LENNY=>She'll recover.
MONA=>That's good.
JOY=>Where there's life there's hope.
TRISH=>That's right.
HELEN=>You bet.
MONA=>Absolutely.
LENNY=>Yeah.
JOY=>Could you pass over the sweet potatoes, please?
TRISH=>Sure.
HELEN=>Could you pass down the stuffing, please?
LENNY=>Here.
TRISH=>Anyone watch Leno last night?
MONA=>So what's going to happen now to that woman who killed your super?
HELEN=>I don't know, Mom. But it's so sad. She's all alone. I wish I'd gotten to know her better. We might have found we had something in common.
JOY=>Maybe you'll write a poem about her.
HELEN=>I'm sorry. But don't worry. I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing with you.
JOY=>But I'm not laughing.
MONA=>Let's make a toast.
JOY=>To happiness.
EVERYONE ELSE=>To happiness!
TRISH=>Kooki!
BILLY=>I came!
JOY=>Don't, Mom. 'Cause the thing about family is…no matter how distant you are from each other, separated, estranged, divorced, whatever…no matter how little you can relate to each other…it doesn't matter: you're still family. You're not along… Ya see?
ALLEN=>Hello?
JOY=>Hello. Could I please speak to Allen Mellencamp?
ALLEN=>Speaking.
JOY=>Well, my sister Helen told me I should call you.
ALLEN=>Oh, then you must be Joy. Hi.
JOY=>Hi. Gee, you sound so familiar.
ALLEN=>You do too.
JOY=>But in a good way, a way I like.
ALLEN=>Me too.
JOY=>Huh.
ALLEN=>Say, what are you wearing, I mean doing tonight?
JOY=>Oh, nothing special. Would you like to get together?
ALLEN=>Yeah. I know a great place off Exit 146. Have you heard of Happy's?
JOY=>Er…yeah.
