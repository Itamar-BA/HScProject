LATER=>Lights are up. Luke sits on his bike, signing autographs and taking pictures with a gaggle of extremely psyched 8-year old boys. ROMINA GUTIERRES, 26, Hispanic walks against the surge of people exiting the arena. Luke catches sight of her; he drops what he's doing.
LUKE=>You wanna go somewhere? You got plans tonight?
LATER=>ROADIES and performers pack up the steel cage. Luke wanders through the activity and ignores the throngs of kids seeking autographs. He searches the fair for Romina. She is nowhere to be found. He mounts his bike.

JACK=>You can't quit. LUKE
KOFI=>Watch his neck.

LUKE=>You’d think...
LUKE=>I can take care of you.
ROMINA=>What about Kofi?
LUKE=>Seventy-thirty. ROBIN
LUKE=>She’s bummed.
LUKE=>Just calm down. Don’t be so dramatic. OK. You needed this right? You can’t be sleeping at night in a bed with two huge people, worrying about being crushed the whole time if they roll over or something. You need some space to dream, right?

AVERY=>I don’t know... CORY
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI=>I received a call today from D.A. Killcullen. He wanted me to convey to you some words which should come as a relief to you -

AVERY=>What's going on? JASON
AVERY=>Why is there blood on your shirt. Did someone let you in?
AVERY=>Is my son okay?
HEAR...=>MURMUR of a crowd come up and play out the preceding scenes.
APPLAUSE=>A.J. stands against a wall in a fancy suit. Nervous. Uncomfortable. A CAMPAIGN AIDE calls to him. It’s time to go on stage. He takes a breath. Deeply. Walks to meet his father the crowd noise surges. He stands next to his father and together they take in the adoring crowd. A smile forms on his face as he accepts his position. AVERY finally quiets the crowd. And begins his speech.
