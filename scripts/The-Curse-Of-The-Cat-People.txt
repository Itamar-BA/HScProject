CHILDREN=>"The goldenrod is yellow, The corn is turning brown,"
CHILDREN=>"The trees in apple orchards 'With fruit are bending down."
MISS CALLAHAN=>Take a good look, children. It may seen just a little valley with a stream running through it. But, no. It's Sleepy Hollow. Just because you are lucky enough to be the kindergarten class of Tarrytown, you can run and play in Sleepy Hollow -- for exactly fifteen minutes.
AMY=>Where are you going — why do you fly? The whole wide world -- -- my friend -- you're my friend.
MISS CALLAHAN=>to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
ALICE=>That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
OLIVER=>I know it may seem stupid of me--but it
MISS CALLAHAN=>Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
OLIVER=>No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
MISS CALLAHAN=>Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
OLIVER=>Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
ALICE=>You know these fond fathers with their only chicks.
MISS CALLAHAN=>I can see you're worried. And she is a very sensitive and delicately adjusted child.
MISS CALLAHAN=>But a good deal of the blame for that may lie with you, Mr. Reed. Perhaps you're over- anxious -- watch her too closely -- worry too much. The child's bound to feel it.
AMY=>It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
MISS CALLAHAN=>Your birthday, Amy -- as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my
AMY=>Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
MISS CALLAHAN=>Amy and I will meet you at the car.
ALICE=>Here's a drawing by Amy.
ALICE=>She certainly doesn't seem to have inherited any artistic abilities from either of us. Look at that.
OLIVER=>Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
ALICE=>I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
OLIVER=>I'm sure I don't, Alice. It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly -- She could almost be Irena's child.
ALICE=>And that's what worries you?
OLIVER=>I'd hate her to grow up like that.
ALICE=>She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
OLIVER=>All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
ALICE=>I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
OLIVER=>I know that.
ALICE=>That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death. And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
OLIVER=>No. It's not that. It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
ALICE=>I know, dear. I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking. And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
OLIVER=>You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
ALICE=>Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
MISS CALLAHAN=>You'd better hurry. I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient. She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
OLIVER=>We'll see that she gets there in good time
ALICE=>I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were. I hope you'll come to see us.
MISS CALLAHAN=>I'd love to.
EDWARD=>Who can blame me if I cry my fill, Johnny has gone for a soldier.
EDWARD=>Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
AMY=>Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
EDWARD=>Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
OLIVER=>Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
EDWARD=>When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard. I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
OLIVER=>I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
OLIVER=>I thought we were going to save those
EDWARD=>Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed. I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
AMY=>Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
OLIVER=>You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
EDWARD=>You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
OLIVER=>Go on -- out with you.
EDWARD=>One for the one year: Then she didn't say a word. One for the two year: That was whooping cough we heard. One for the three year: She got lost then for an hour. One for the four year: She turned pretty as a flower. One for the five year: Best child I ever did see. One for the six year: I don't know what that'll be.
OLIVER=>We'll all see that it's a good year for her, Edward.
OLIVER=>Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
ALICE=>I forgot I had it on.
OLIVER=>Where is everybody?
ALICE=>It's early yet.
OLIVER=>It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
OLIVER=>Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
ALICE=>Times have changed.
ALICE=>Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
OLIVER=>No kids yet. Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
ALICE=>All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
OLIVER=>I think I should. 3000W?
ALICE=>That's right.
OLIVER=>Something's haywire,
ALICE=>What do you mean?
OLIVER=>I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.
ALICE=>But they must have. Amy and I made them out together. You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
EDWARD=>Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
OLIVER=>And Amy mailed them?
EDWARD=>She pleaded so to do it
OLIVER=>Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
AMY=>Yes, daddy.
OLIVER=>Did you mail then?
AMY=>Yes, I did.
OLIVER=>Where did you mail them?
AMY=>I'll show you.
OLIVER=>Amy, not that old tree!
AMY=>Yes, daddy.
OLIVER=>But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
AMY=>I didn't forget.
OLIVER=>But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real. That tree's no mailbox.
OLIVER=>Well, there they are. Look, darling, Mother and daddy keep telling you over and over again, but you go right on dreaming, and then things like this happen.
AMY=>If the invitations didn't go, then that means nobody will come, doesn't it? There won't be any party.
OLIVER=>Yes, there is going to be a party! We'll have one ourselves -- you and me and mommy and Edward.
EDWARD=>You've got to blow 'em all out in one blow, Amy.
OLIVER=>Amy, make a wish. Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
AMY=>But wishes don't come true.
OLIVER=>Certain wishes do.
AMY=>But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
OLIVER=>But this is different. Go on blow,
ALICE=>You get your wish!
AMY=>You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
EDWARD=>Now it's all ruined, you shouldn't speak your wish.
ALICE=>But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
AMY=>I can make wishes like this come true. I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
OLIVER=>That's right, darling, and you'll make daddy very happy if you'll just leave that dream world of yours and come into the same world with Daddy and Mommy the nice, pleasant world of everyday things.
AMY=>Hello, Jack.
EVELYN=>What comes next?
LUCILE=>Double knocks, of course.
EVELYN=>I just seem to stay in double knocks forever.
EVELYN=>Of course, it's very hard to do anything with somebody breathing down your neck.
LUCILE=>What was I In?
DOROTHY=>You were in threes of over the fence.
LUCILE=>Oh, yes.
AMY=>May I play too?
DOROTHY=>Why don't you go home?
LUCILE=>You might just as well stop being nice to us, Amy Reed. We're mad at you.
AMY=>Why?
LUCILE=>Because you said you were going to invite us to your birthday party.
EVELYN=>And you didn't!
AMY=>But I did! I did invite you!
DOROTHY=>Look at the giraffe!
GIRLS=>Run! Run faster! Ditch her!
AMY=>I invited you to my party. I did, I did, I did.
AMY=>I did invite you. I did invite you. I did. I did.
CHILDREN=>We ditched her. Serves her right.
CHILDREN=>The old house. There's a witch in it. It's haunted. Count three, count four, Run past the door. That's the best thing to say for witches.
VOICE=>Little girl. Little girl. Come into the garden. It's pleasant and cool here -- ever so pleasant -- ever so cool out of the hot sun --
VOICE=>Little girl, step back away from the house so that I can see you. Step back, little girl.
VOICE=>Go away, little girl. Go away.
EDWARD=>Oh, you were a lordly fellow handsome as a king and full of pride. Struttin' and showin' off and scratchin' up the earth
EDWARD=>A lordly fellow -- a lordly fellow -- and now you lie on your back with your legs in the air, and you don't even know what the score is -- no, sir, you don't even know what the score is.
EDWARD=>Guess you'll be wanting a glass of milk, Amy.
AMY=>Look at my ring.
EDWARD=>That's a fine-looking ring.
AMY=>A lady threw it to me.
EDWARD=>Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
AMY=>It's a pretty ring.
EDWARD=>I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
AMY=>A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
EDWARD=>Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
AMY=>the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
EDWARD=>They're given to the living in memory of the dead. If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
AMY=>Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
EDWARD=>That's the clever way to do it.
AMY=>I didn't play, Edward. They wouldn't play with me,
EDWARD=>Your daddy isn't going to like that. He had his heart set on your playing with the other kids.
AMY=>I'd better tell him.
OLIVER=>Your daddy's so pleased with you he's building a model ship for your very own. Come take a look at it.
OLIVER=>You see, when you are a good girl and play with other children instead of moping and dreaming by yourself, your daddy wants to do everything he can to make you happy.
AMY=>Daddy --
OLIVER=>What do you want. Amy?
AMY=>I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.
OLIVER=>Can't you tell me later?
AMY=>But I didn't play with them, Daddy. They wouldn't play with me.
OLIVER=>What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
AMY=>It was on account of the birthday party.
OLIVER=>Because you didn't ask them? I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
AMY=>They ran away.
OLIVER=>Why didn't you run after them?
AMY=>I did. I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
OLIVER=>Now Amy
AMY=>It's true.
OLIVER=>And who did the voice belong to?
AMY=>It was just a voice.
OLIVER=>Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
AMY=>Daddy, it's true.
OLIVER=>Let me be the judge of that.
ALICE=>(trying to pour oil on the
OLIVER=>Amy's been lying again.
AMY=>No, I didn't.
OLIVER=>Voices from an old dark house!
ALICE=>Did you hear the child out?
OLIVER=>Well, it seemed to me --
ALICE=>You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
OLIVER=>I'm never unfair.
ALICE=>You're shouting at me.
OLIVER=>I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
OLIVER=>I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
AMY=>You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
ALICE=>We're not really fighting darling -- just a little argument. You run out and play -- go on now -- We'll make up.
EDWARD=>Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
AMY=>I'm trying to.
EDWARD=>Let me take another look at that ring.
EDWARD=>Sure enough, that's a real mourning ring and it's got wishing power. You'd, better sit down and think of some good wishes to make.
AMY=>I wish for a friend.
EDWARD=>Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
OLIVER=>I like to see her happy.
EDWARD=>So do I, Mr. Reed.
OLIVER=>Nothing wrong with your appetite, is there?
EDWARD=>I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
OLIVER=>That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling. You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
EDWARD=>Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
AMY=>I wasn't singing to myself.
EDWARD=>Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
AMY=>All through.
ALICE=>What are saying, darling?
AMY=>I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
ALICE=>I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
AMY=>I thought I'd never forget that song.
ALICE=>What song, dear?
AMY=>The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
ALICE=>Oh, you'll remember it some time.
AMY=>Mommy --
ALICE=>Yes, darling.
AMY=>Did you ever make a wish?
ALICE=>Oh, lots of times.
AMY=>Did your wishes ever come true?
ALICE=>Sometimes.
AMY=>I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
ALICE=>Where did you get this ring?
AMY=>That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
ALICE=>But where did you get it, Amy?
AMY=>At the old house with the voice.
ALICE=>Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
AMY=>On the back street — a green house
ALICE=>The Farren house
AMY=>Do you know the people?
ALICE=>No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
AMY=>Are they nice?
ALICE=>I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
AMY=>I got my wish anyway.
ALICE=>You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
AMY=>But it's already come true.
ALICE=>Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
EDWARD=>Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
AMY=>But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
EDWARD=>You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
AMY=>Will you come soon?
EDWARD=>Soon as I finish.
AMY=>You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
EDWARD=>I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
AMY=>That means I can go alone?
MISS CALLAHAN=>Hello, Amy.
AMY=>Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
MISS CALLAHAN=>No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
AMY=>I live right here.
MISS CALLAHAN=>Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
ALICE=>I'll get it. I'll get it, Edward.
EDWARD'S VOICE=>Yes, Ma'am
ALICE=>Oh, hello.
MISS CALLAHAN=>Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
ALICE=>Please come in.
ALICE=>Ever since yesterday I've been thinking about you.
ALICE=>I've been thinking you're the sort of person I'd like to know better. I'm glad you came.
ALICE=>Oliver's pet, I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
MISS CALLAHAN=>I know how it is. My Dad collects miniature canon.
ALICE=>If they're connected with boats, we have 'em.
MISS CALLAHAN=>They may be trouble to dust, but they're nice. I like to see a home like this -- a home connected with people's work and thoughts — things they love.
ALICE=>It doesn't fit,does it?
ALICE=>But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats -- are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
MISS CALLAHAN=>But you don't keep a cat, do you?
ALICE=>We don't even like them, I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it. It was his first wife's favorite picture. She was
MISS CALLAHAN=>I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
ALICE=>Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday — about Oliver's first marriage — and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy — although he'll never realize it.
AMY=>Can I see the lady who gave me this ring?
BARBARA=>What is it?
AMY=>My mother told me to give back the ring to the lady who gave it to me.
BARBARA=>Sit there.
ALICE=>It's almost as if there were a curse on us. I wouldn't care if it were on me, but it seems to be directed against the child. Irena haunts this house.
ALICE=>I thought you were with Amy.
EDWARD=>No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
ALICE=>That's the Farren house.
EDWARD=>Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
ALICE=>But I told her to go with you.
EDWARD=>She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
ALICE=>You do that, Edward.
MISS CALLAHAN=>That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
ALICE=>Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.
MISS CALLAHAN=>But quite harmless, I'm sure.
MRS. FARREN=>I agree with you. God should use a rose amber spot. The sun is not kind.
MRS. FARREN=>I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
AMY=>If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
AMY=>But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
MRS. FARREN=>Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
AMY=>But I only came to give back the ring.
MRS. FARREN=>The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
MRS. FARREN=>Let's have tea, shall we? The tea will be good and strong and red now — the way I like it!
MRS. FARREN=>She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
AMY=>Who is she?
MRS. FARREN=>That woman is an imposter, a liar,
AMY=>Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
MRS. FARREN=>There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
AMY=>No, thank you.
MRS. FARREN=>One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
MRS. FARREN=>Child, have you ever seen a play?
AMY=>I like stories.
MRS. FARREN=>Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
AMY=>Mommy read it to ne.
MRS. FARREN=>Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
MRS. FARREN=>Well, then you must hear it. I shall tell
MRS. FARREN=>You sit here and we'll pretend that's a stage.
MRS. FARREN=>The Headless Horseman --
AMY=>Why hasn't he got a head?
MRS. FARREN=>It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
MRS. FARREN=>At night the Headless Horseman rides...
EDWARD=>Is my little miss here -- ? A little girl with hair about the color of yours, ma'am?
EDWARD=>About time for you to come home, Amy.
AMY=>But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
MRS. FARREN=>Let the child stay.
EDWARD=>Now, I don't know Amy --
AMY=>He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
MRS. FARREN=>Good.
EDWARD=>Now Amy, I didn't say --
MRS. FARREN=>On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
EDWARD=>Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
MRS. FARREN=>...At the hour of midnight, down the road
EDWARD=>Come away, Amy.
MRS. FARREN=>-- If you stand on that bridge at the wrong hour -- the hour when he rides by, his great cloak sweeps around you, he swings you to his saddle bow, and you have to ride forever your eyes seeing for his blind eyes, your ears listening for his ears long deafened and dead, and always his cold arms around you, crushing you into the cavity of his bony chest. Then forever you must ride and ride and ride with the Headless Horseman.
EDWARD=>Come along now.
AMY=>I've had a nice time, but I have to go home now. Good-bye.
AMY=>Good-bye.
AMY=>Thank you.
EDWARD=>Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
AMY=>But she's such a nice lady.
EDWARD=>But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
BARBARA=>A liar -- an impostor -- your own daughter. You call me that and yet you are sweet and kind to the little girl -- a stranger --
MRS. FARREN=>My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
BARBARA=>Look at me.
MRS. FARREN=>You're an impostor.
MRS. FARREN'S VOICE=>He comes riding, riding, riding. On the dark nights-- on the nights of storm...
ALICE=>Listen!
OLIVER=>What is it, Alice?
ALICE=>I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
AMY=>My friend... I'm frightened... my friend.
AMY=>I'm glad you came...my friend sing me that song again.
ALICE=>Ollie.
OLIVER=>What?
ALICE=>It's your play.
OLIVER=>I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
ALICE=>Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
AMY=>I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
OLIVER=>I haven't had my breakfast.
ALICE=>Well, you know where it is.
OLIVER=>You see the way I get treated. You're the only one who has any pull around here.
ALICE=>Where'd you get this, darling?
AMY=>It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
ALICE=>She was very pretty.
AMY=>What's her name?
ALICE=>Irena.
AMY=>Irena.
ALICE=>Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
AMY=>All right, mommy.
ALICE=>Ollie!
OLIVER=>Where did you get it?
ALICE=>Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
ALICE=>Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
OLIVER=>I suppose so.
AMY=>Who are you?
IRENA=>You called me by my name.
AMY=>Irena. But who are you?
IRENA=>I'm your friend.
AMY=>I've wanted a friend.
IRENA=>I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
AMY=>But where do you come from?
IRENA=>You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
AMY=>But where is that?
IRENA=>I can not tell you.
AMY=>Will you be friend for always?
IRENA=>For as long as you'll let me.
AMY=>I shall want you for always.
IRENA=>For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
AMY=>Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
IRENA=>No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
AMY=>Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
AMY=>You'll always play with me?
IRENA=>Whenever you want.
IRENA=>Can't you get it, darling?
AMY=>I'll just never learn arithmetic.
IRENA=>But you must!
AMY=>The numbers simply don't mean anything
IRENA=>Oh yes they do. Look. One is like a tall princess.
AMY=>A princess?
IRENA=>Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
AMY=>Yes, yes! I see Prince,
IRENA=>That's right!
AMY=>This is more fun than just pretend.
IRENA=>Of course,
ALICE=>What's funny?
OLIVER=>That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
IRENA=>There's an oak leaf. Add a maple.
AMY=>That one's an elm.
IRENA=>light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
AMY=>But we don't have any sea weed.
IRENA=>Pretend, darling. It's All Soul's Eve. Round about the fire we go... Over the flames we leapt
IRENA=>Come on, Amy. Jump over the fire.
AMY=>No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead. You be the friend who comes to see me. I'll show you my children.
IRENA=>Your children?
AMY=>My dolls. We can pretend.
IRENA=>All right, Amy. Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
AMY=>Yes, winter's coming. I don't like the winter,
IRENA=>Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
AMY=>All my children are taking their naps. We must be very quiet. This is Lottie...she's very good... this is Mary Ann...she's good sometimes...this is Virginia... she's hardly ever good.
AMY=>These are all from me.
OLIVER=>This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
ALICE=>Oh, thank you, darling.
AMY=>You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
OLIVER=>I guess if you can wait, so can we.
OLIVER=>"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
EDWARD=>Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
AMY=>Just you wait!
OLIVER=>And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
AMY=>She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
OLIVER=>This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
OLIVER=>Who's it for, Amy? Do we have to guess? Come on, tell us who it's for.
CAROLERS' VOICES=>"It came upon the midnight clear, That glorious song of old, Froci angels
ALICE=>Ask them in, Ollie. Edward, fix something warm for them to drink.
CAROLERS=>"Peace on the earth, good will to men From heav'ns all gracious King, The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing."
OLIVER=>Merry Christmas! Come on in.
OLIVER=>There's a big fire in the living room. Edward's fixing something hot for you all to drink.
MISS PLUMETT=>How bounteous! But then I have always remarked that you were a very bounteous young man, Mr. Reed.
OLIVER=>The sentiment is mutual, Miss Plummet.
OLIVER=>Right in here.
ALICE=>Merry Christmas, The carols were beautiful.
AD LIBS=>Merry Christmas... Thank you, Mrs. Reed...what a marvelous fire... And what a beautiful tree...
MISS PLUMETT=>My dear Mrs. Reed, of all the houses we have visited tonight, yours.. I do swear.. has the truest dyed-in-tradition Christmas spirit.
ALICE=>Why, thank you.
MISS CALLAHAN=>The old girl ought to make a record of that. She says it at every house we go to.
LOIS=>What'd you get for Christmas?
AMY=>I don't know yet.
LOIS=>My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
LOIS=>We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
AMY=>Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
LOIS=>Hm.
ALICE=>Couldn't we have another carol? I'll play it for you,, or at least try to, on the piano.
MISS PLUMETT=>Of course you may have another carol. What shall it be, good friends?
ALICE=>Oh, I know one. "Shepherds Shake off your drowsy sleep."
MISS PLUMETT=>Now remember, all. We start con vivace,
IRENA=>"D'ou vient cetts troupe d'anges, Et tous les cieux plelns d'eclairs! Eh! fi'ou
MISS PLUMETT=>Ready, friends? Remember now, con vivace, and at the very end, poco ritardo, if you please.
CAROLERS=>"Shepherds, shake off your drowsy sleep, Rise and leave you silly sheep; Angels from heav'n around loud singing, Tidings of great joy are bringing."
CAROLERS' VOICES=>"Shepherds! the chorus come and swell! Sing Noel, 0 sing Noel!"
IRENA=>"Je vous chanto une merveille, Qui remplit tout ce bas lieu D'une joio non pareille De la part do ce grand Dieu, D'une jolo non parcille, De la part de ce grand Dieu."
AMY=>Merry Christmas, Irena. I brought you a present.
IRENA=>Oh, thank you, Amy.
AMY=>You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
IRENA=>Oh, how beautiful!
AMY=>It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
IRENA=>I shall wear it in my hair!
AMY=>Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it! I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy. I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
IRENA=>You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
AMY=>Oh, please!
ALICE'S VOICE=>Amy! Amy! Where are you, Amy?
ALICE'S VOICE=>Amy!
IRENA=>Better go in now. Run along, darling.
AMY=>Merry Christmas.
IRENA=>A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
AMY=>I got lots of presents.
MISS CALLAHAN=>And you should. Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
AMY=>Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
ALICE=>Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
AMY=>But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
ALICE=>All right, Amy. Go tell Edward to take you.
MISS CALLAHAN=>Does she go up to the Farren's often?
ALICE=>No. I only let her go with Edward. It's alright.
AMY=>Hurry Edward, Hurry.
EDWARD'S VOICE=>Just have patience, little miss.
AMY=>So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
IRENA=>You wanted to share this moment with me.
AMY=>It stands so still.
IRENA=>Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
AMY=>I can sea its breath in the cold.
IRENA=>It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
AMY=>May I pet the deer?
IRENA=>It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
AMY=>I want to touch it.
AMY=>There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
EDWARD=>Come on now, we'd better hurry if we want to get to Mrs. Farren's before dark. They start out of the yard.
AMY=>I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
MRS. FARREN=>A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
EDWARD=>There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
MRS. FARREN=>That's from her -- that woman.
MRS. FARREN=>Well, let's see what we have here. In my time I've had many presents, Christmas and otherwise. The King of Spain once gave me this ring.
MRS. FARREN=>What's that?
EDWARD=>It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
MRS. FARREN=>Wait a minute. Listen.
AMY=>What?
MRS. FARREN=>Don't you hear it?
EDWARD=>What is it, ma'am?
MRS. FARREN=>
AMY=>Who's Herne the Huntsman?
MRS. FARREN=>"There is an old tale goes, that Herne, the hunter, Sometimes a keeper here in Windsor forest, Doth all the winter time, at still midnight, Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns; And there he blasts the trees," Ah, well, it's a bad generation -- forgetting all the beautiful words. I'll tell you plainly -- there's a wild huntsman who scours the forest with his dogs and his men. He winds his horn and the woods echo with it. Everywhere he passes the animals are slaughtered and lie dead beneath his trampling feet. If he should catch up with anyone walking in the wood, forever and forever they would have to hunt with Herne, the Huntsman and his wild rout. Hear his horn?
AMY=>And does he kill people?
MRS. FARREN=>No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
EDWARD=>It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
MRS. FARREN=>Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
AMY=>starts to lead her from the room) Merry Christmas.
BARBARA=>You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
MRS. FARREN=>My daughter died long ago.
EDWARD=>Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
AMY=>But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
EDWARD=>Bad luck to see death in the snow.
AMY=>But what happened to the little deer?
EDWARD=>Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
AMY=>Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
EDWARD=>Because it can't. It's dead.
AMY=>But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
EDWARD=>It got hit.
AMY=>But where has it gone? Where's all the strength and the quickness?
AMY=>I'll ask my friend. She'll know.
ALICE=>I love the smell of pine.
MISS CALLAHAN=>It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
ALICE=>It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we
ALICE=>I've even got some pictures of myself all got up in tattered green and waving around a wooden sword. They're in here, I think.
ALICE=>Oh, oh. What did I lose?
AMY=>I've got it, mommy.
AMY=>Daddy!
OLIVER=>Yes, Amy?
AMY=>Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
OLIVER=>You couldn't know this woman. She died before you were born. Why did you call her your friend?
OLIVER=>Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
AMY=>Because she is my friend.
ALICE=>Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
OLIVER=>We've got to go on. Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
AMY=>It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
OLIVER=>In the garden? Would she be there now?
AMY=>She's there whenever I call her!
OLIVER=>Amy, I want you to look all around ...very carefully...and then I want you to tell me if your friend is out there now in the garden.
AMY'S VOICE=>Irena!
AMY=>She's there, just like I said she'd be.
OLIVER=>Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
AMY=>Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
OLIVER=>Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
AMY=>But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
OLIVER=>Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
AMY=>But...
OLIVER=>I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
OLIVER=>All right. Amy. Tell me that you see nothing.
AMY=>But she is here.
MISS CALLAHAN=>You know, there's another thing I just
MISS CALLAHAN=>We were such a large family that I remember one Twelfth Night there was no pine branch left for me to wish upon, but my brother, who was nearest me, said., "Don't you worry. I'll wish for both of us."
ALICE=>Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
MISS CALLAHAN=>What do you mean?
ALICE=>I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
OLIVER=>She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
OLIVER=>But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
MISS CALLAHAN=>She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
OLIVER=>Everything you say is no doubt very true. But what worries me is that Amy keeps escaping from reality. I went through that once- with Irena. I saw her... Alice and I both saw Irena lose her mind. Do you think I can sit here calmly and watch my child.
MISS CALLAHAN=>It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
ALICE=>How?
MISS CALLAHAN=>Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
OLIVER=>But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
MISS CALLAHAN=>Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
ALICE=>Oliver, what is it?
OLIVER=>Amy. She's gone. Better get your coat.
MISS CALLAHAN=>Give me the state police. And hurry!
OLIVER=>She's gone into the woods.
MRS. FARREN'S VOICE=>Up and down he rides...
MRS. FARREN=>Don't you like the wind, Regan? Or is your name Goneril?
BARBARA=>I hate the storm. I hate it!
MRS. FARREN=>The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
BARBARA=>But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
MRS. FARREN=>My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
BARBARA=>But I didn't die. Don't you understand? It was you. Your mind was dead for nearly ten years after that accident. You didn't know anybody; you couldn't remember anything. And then, when memory returned, you called for me, and I came into your bedroom to see you. I was sixteen years old then, ten years older than when you last remembered me. You said I wasn't your daughter... I loved you... I wanted you for my mother...but you denied me. You said they were playing tricks on you, that your daughter was a little girl.
BARBARA=>Look at me now. Look into my eyes. Tell me I'm Barbara... your daughter Barbara.
MRS. FARREN=>No, no. It isn't true. Everything you say is a lie. You're a poor, drunken woman. You're not my Barbara.
TROOPER=>This is where she must have left the road. The hounds have picked up her scent on that frozen meadow.
CAPTAIN=>Good.
OLIVER=>All right. Go ahead. We'll follow.
MRS. FARREN'S VOICE=>Herne, the Huntsman of death... Herne, the Huntsman of death... Herne, the Huntsman of death...
BARBARA=>Yes, that's it. That's the very song! The song from "Cymbeline." I was singing it, just like you said, the night of the accident. I can even remember the words... "Fear no more the heat o' the sun. Nor the furious winter's rages... "
BARBARA=>Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
MRS. FARREN=>Anybody could know that song.
BARBARA=>Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
MRS. FARREN=>Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
BARBARA=>And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
MRS. FARREN=>Yes...yes, that's true.
BARBARA=>And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
MRS. FARREN=>It was pale...a shadowed gold.
BARBARA=>My hair's like that. Isn't it? Isn't it?
BARBARA=>Mother! You called me by name!
MRS. FARREN=>Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
BARBARA=>Oh, mother! Mother, darling, you've called me. You know me. I don't mind anything now...all the long years of waiting...all the starved, hungry years. We've found each other. I love you, I love you!
BARBARA=>Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
MRS. FARREN=>Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
BARBARA=>It's a dream come true.
BARBARA=>There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
MRS. FARREN=>I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
BARBARA=>If that child comes here...if I find her
MRS. FARREN=>I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
BARBARA=>Good night, mother, good night.
MRS. FARREN=>Good night...Barbara...
AMY'S VOICE=>Mrs. Farren! Mrs. Farren!
MRS. FARREN=>Little girl....poor little girl...
AMY=>Hide me? Why?
MRS. FARREN=>My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
MRS. FARREN=>You'll have to help me. I rarely go up the stairs any more. The doctor forbade it. We'll have to be very quiet...ever so quiet...my little girl is in her room, waiting to kill you. We mustn't let her find you.
MRS. FARREN=>We must hurry. We must hide together, you and I.
AMY=>Hurry, hurry.
MRS. FARREN=>Yes, yes -
AMY=>Hurry!
AMY=>Mrs. Farren,...Mrs. Farren...
BARBARA'S VOICE=>Let me out! Let me out!
IRENA'S VOICE=>Amy. Amy.
AMY=>It's you...Irena...my friend!
IRENA=>Don't cry, Amy.
AMY=>She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
IRENA=>You mustn't be afraid.
AMY=>But she's dead!
IRENA=>Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
AMY=>Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
IRENA=>But, Amy! Amy...I'm dead.
AMY=>You?
IRENA=>Yes, Amy.
AMY=>But why?
IRENA=>Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and
TROOPERS' VOICES=>In there. She must be in there.
OLIVER=>Oh, Amy! Darling, I thought we'd lost you. I thought I'd never find you again!
ALICE=>Darling. Are you all right, darling?
CAPTAIN=>Mr. Reed.
AMY=>Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
OLIVER=>But there's no one here, darling.
AMY=>She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
CAPTAIN=>The door's locked,
TROOPER=>The key's there in the lock, sir.
BARBARA=>Who turned the key in that lock? I heard, the voice of my mother and the voice of that child, and when I tried to get out, the door was locked. Who turned that key and locked me in?
CAPTAIN=>There's been no one up here,
BARBARA=>_ Even your last moment was stolen from me.
BARBARA=>You did it! You stole her love! Thief. Thief. You thief!
OLIVER=>We're going home, Amy.
TROOPER=>Who do you think locked that door?
CAPTAIN=>Whoever did saved the life of that child. That woman's deranged.
AMY=>Daddy?
OLIVER=>Yes, darling.
AMY=>Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
OLIVER=>Yes, darling, I can see her.
