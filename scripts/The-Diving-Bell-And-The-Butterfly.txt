ON THE BLINK:=>INT. BUTTERFLY CHRYSALIS / EXT. A HELD OFWILD FLOWERS - DAY A Dark and blurry image. Still for a moment. Then, movement. Ashudder. An awakening, mysterious and auspicious. The chrysalis begins to crack open and bright day light burns the screen. Slowly the image adjusts. Summer landscape. Golden, idyllic, breathtaking colors. The flowers sway in a gentle breeze. The Camera suddenly takes flight. It flies, hovers, floats, soars above the dancing wild flowers. We hear the amplified sound of butterfly's wings flapping. And after some moments of this beautiful and spectacular sight:
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>Never mind. It's my private joke.
I.=>E - T - A - O - I - N - U - S - H -

SANDRINE=>Any time -
CLAUDE=>I'll do my best for you.
CLOSE ON JEAN-DO=>INT. MAIN HALL, HOSPITAL - DAY CLAUDE wheels JEAN-DO down the hall towards the open double doors, their reflections in the glass-fronted cupboards. Jean-Do looks at the stained-glass window that depicts Empress Eugenie.
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>But my favorite sight of all is the lighthouse, tall, robust, reassuring in red and white stripes. I place myself under the protection of this brotherly symbol, guardian not just of sailors but of the sick whom fate has cast to the far edge of life.
FOURNEAU=>Is it a man or a woman? JOUBERT
JOUBERT=>There was no one there. SANDRINE

JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>No, Father. I've been to Lourdes -
JEAN-DO=>We can't have a dirty week-end in Lourdes, it doesn't seem right -
JOSEPHINE=>I want to see the Madonna!
JOSEPHINE=>Look! Here's my Madonna!
JOSEPHINE=>How wonderful. Thank you.
SOUVENIR SHOP WINDOW=>There in the centre, the identical Madonna with its lights winking The Madonna blinks away. INT. REHAB CENTRE - DAY JEAN-DO'S POV of himself in a large brightly painted room once used as a ballet studio with mirrors and barres lining the walls. JEAN-DO is tethered to a board raised to a vertical position. He sees himself and either side of the board stand BEATRICE and SANDRINE.
CLAUDE=>All right to turn this off? The call will be coming in about ten minutes. I've typed up the passage. You want me to read it to you?
MME. BAUBY=>Don't tire him. He's not well.
JEAN-DO=>That wouldn't be difficult.
PAPINOU=>I don't want to read it. JEAN-DO
PAPINOU=>No. If you cut me, I'll sue.
JEAN-DO=>I won't. It's our secret. PAPINOU
JEAN-DO=>I'm sure they would, if they had the chance to smell you.

JEAN-DO.=>C.U. OF JEAN-DO'S FACE
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>At Berck, wheelchairs are as commonplace as Ferraris at Monte Carlo.
E.=>Some. Some? Is that it? That wasn't so bad, was it? I did rather well. Shall I go on? Who? Who's visited you? E - T - A - O - I - N - U - S - H - R - P - C - D - Y - W - V - M - X - B - F - G - J - K - L -
THEOPHILE=>Can we have ice-creams?
SYLVIE=>Here's some money-
QUICK FLASH=>CUT:
SYLVIE=>E - T - A - O - I - N - N ?
SYLVIE=>What was the word?
SYLVIE=>Well done, Celeste!
THEOPHILE=>When can we go home?
SYLVIE=>Kiss Pop goodbye -
SYLVIE=>In my bag. I'll find it.
THEOPHILE=>I'll come again soon, too - SYLVIE squeezes a smile and they go. The dying sun streams in through the window. JEAN-DO gazes at the drawing of the fish.
BLINK, BLACK: SCENE=>CONTINUES IN:
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>No. The only memory I have is of Theophile being there. And he was frightened. I wanted to ask him what he remembered but I didn't. I thought it might frighten him even more.
PAPINOU VOICE=>Yes, yes, yes, Sylvie told me -
PAPINOU=>Oh yes, I had a thought.
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>It can't be easy for him to speak to a son who he knows will never reply.
J EAN-DO'S VOICE=>At times I don't know anymore.
MALE NURSE=>Jean-Do I'm going to leave you here for a second. I'll be right back.
THE MIRROR=>SANDRINE sits on JEAN-DO'S left. Both face the m irror full on. CLAUDE and BEATRICE watch.
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>How about that? That's me to a T.
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>Like Noirtier in his wheel chair, communicating only with his eyes. He haunts me.
THE PHOTOGRAPH=>The one seen in Papinou's apartment of JEAN-DO aged 11 on a miniature golf course.
THE WOMAN'S VOICE=>I know he can't speak, I just meant -
SYLVIE=>But he can hear you -
SYLVIE=>I beg your pardon?

N.E-=>O n e . E - T - A - 0 - I - N - U - S - s. E - E - T - A - O - I - N - U - S - H - R - P - C -
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>It's been my great fortune to have had exceptional women in my life.
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>Talking about dreams is boring, especially other people's dreams. But last night, I dreamt I visited Paris's wax museum.
TODAY.=>He enters. There are onlytwo wax models. One is of DR MERCIER, the ophthalmologist, grotesque, leering, with his hands covered in congealed blood. The other is Monsieur Noirtier As JEAN-DO passes them, MERCIER winks and Monsieur Noirtier cackles electronically. There's yet another arch and over it the sign:
A SURPRISE=>BEATRICE and FEMALE NURSES, all in outrageouslysexy outfits.
TOMORROW=>It is an exact replica of his Room 119, but the photos and drawings are ill- defined as if the wall melted. There is no one in the bed, just a hollow in the middle of the yellow sheets. But surrounding the bed are wax models of DR. LEPAGE and DR. COCHETON, SANDRINE, SYLVIE, CELESTE, THEOPHILE and CLAUDE. He weaves his way between them, examining them closely: SANDRINE smiling, SYLVIE with frozen tears on her cheeks, the children smiling, too, the others have their hands stretched out towards the hollow in the bed as if in supplication or a benediction. Where the speaker-phone should be there is a lever with a sign:
PULL ME=>He pulls the lever and from the ceiling, like confetti, a great rain of paper descends. They're the letters of the alphabet and they stick to the wax models and to JEAN-DO in nonsensical order. Above the next arch, the legend:
YESTERDAY=>Jean-Do sees himself sitting in a first class seat on an airplane. All of the other seats on the plane are empty. A man, Roussin, approaches the sitting Jean-Do.
FEMALE NURSE'S VOICE=>Come on, Jean-Do, your sleeping pill.
JEAN-DO'S VOICE=>The Kangaroo escaped the Zoo. "Goodbye zoo!" cried Kangaroo, Cleared the wall -
PAUL=>'Morning, Monsieur.
THEOPHILE=>Are we going to a theatre?
CLOSE JEAN-DO.,=>more tightly. EXT. RAILWAY CROSSING - DAY The barriers are down. The BMW has to stop and wait. INT. BMW - DAY JEAN-DO is beginning to feel more unwell but doesn't quite know what the matter is.
CLAUDE'S VOICE=>I had time for one last thought.
CLOSE JEAN-DO'S EYE.=>THE POV IS NO LONGER JEAN-DO'S.
JEAN-DOMINQUE BAUBY=>JEAN-DO blinks. CLAUDE hands open the book.
ON SECOND=>BLINK:
