SPARTAN=>Because there's anger and there's frustration, and then there's pure fucking evil...
SPARTAN=>Where we're going is pure fucking evil. Thirty people who were riding that muni bus are still missing. I've got this bad hunch about who took them and where they are...
SPARTAN=>I just... ... demolish things.
SPARTAN=>I do my job, shit happens. Get a thermo.
SPARTAN=>What's that?
SPARTAN=>Yeah, sometimes...
PHOENIX=>Motherfucker.
SPARTAN=>That's a warm welcome.
SPARTAN=>How 'bout some light, guys?
SPARTAN=>Simon Phoenix. You're under arrest. Where are the muni passengers?
PHOENIX=>Fuck you, Spartan. They're gone. I told the city no one comes down here anymore. Cops figured it out, postmen figured it out. Damn bus drivers wouldn't listen. Arrest me? You've got no jurisdiction here. You're in my kingdom now. Fifty blocks in every direction. And it's mine.
SPARTAN=>It's over.
PHOENIX=>It's over?! Yeah. It's over. But I've been king once, and I ain't ever going back to jail.
LAMB=>It's Spartan again...
HEALY=>What's the matter with you? That's why nobody ever invites you over.
SPARTAN=>I hate small talk. You sent me to do a job, I did it. It wasn't even me who blew everything up this time.
HEALY=>Yeah. Sure.
TFR OFFICER=>Captain. Captain! There's a lot of bodies in here.
HEALY=>You have the right to remain silent.
SPARTAN=>I'm going to be back. I'll still be your dad. I promise.
KATIE SPARTAN=>I love you, Daddy.
SMITHERS=>John Spartan. You've done great deeds for the city of Los Angeles, so it is with some regret that I hereby...
SPARTAN=>Skip it...
SMITHERS=>John Spartan. You've been sentenced to 70 years in the California CryoPenitentiary for the involuntary manslaughter of thirty...
SPARTAN=>Skip it...
SMITHERS=>I'm sorry, John. Don't catch cold.
SPARTAN=>Fuh... fuf... funny.
SPARTAN=>See ya next century...
HUXLEY=>Mellow greeting, Warden John J. Smithers.
SMITHERS=>Yeah. BE well. Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.
HUXLEY=>As it is a beautiful Monday morning, and as my duty log irrationally requires it...
HUXLEY=>I am hereby querying you on the prison population update. Does the tedium continue?
SMITHERS=>Incontrovertibly and unequivocally, yes. The prisoners are ice cubes. They do not move. They have no thoughts, they have no feelings... The tedium is permanent, Lieutenant.
HUXLEY=>I find this lack of stimulus truly disappointing... Don't you think?
SMITHERS=>I try not to. However, you are young, think all you want. Things don't happen anymore, we've taken care of all that. I'll fiber-op you back after the morning non- parole hearings. Have a peachy day, Lieutenant. BE well...
FEMALE COMPUTER=>Coding accepted. Retina Confirm.
FEMALE COMPUTER=>Thank you and be well, Warden William Smithers.
SMITHERS=>Twenty-nine years ago, the parole system, as you know it, was rendered obsolete. Federal Statute 537-29 requires we go through the formality of a hearing for all prisoners incarnated before the repeal of the parole laws. Cocteau Behavioral Engineering, B.E. will continue rehabilitation by altering your behavior through synaptic suggestion during cryogenic sleep. Nightie night. Your hearing is now over. You are to be returned to your cryo- cell immediately... 'Mr. Horace Bateman.' Do you understand what I've said...
SMITHERS=>Guards, nod his head for him... Ne-xt.
HUXLEY=>Huxley, Lenina. Coding on.
CAR COMPUTER=>No police presence is requested in the city at this time. Report to the station. Good morning, Officer Huxley.
HUXLEY=>Ahhh...
CAR COMPUTER=>I detect a promoted level of stress in your tone. Would you like me to prescribe a foodaceutical to...
HUXLEY=>No! What are you, my mother? No. No, thank you though.
HUXLEY=>All right, I'll be reporting in...
PAYNE=>All right, that's it. Twelve hours there'll be another...
PAYNE=>... These assholes are nothing if not predictable.
PAYNE=>Hey guy, it doesn't really matter if we're ready or not anymore.
PERKY DISPATCHER=>Greetings and salutations, welcome to the emergency line of the San Angeles Police Department. How are you?
HUXLEY=>Let me guess, all is serene.
TOUGH COP=>There was a defacement of public buildings. Walls smudged.
HUXLEY=>Really? Brutal. Why wasn't an all cars notified?
CHIEF EARLE=>Because there was no need to create widespread panic. Lieutenant Huxley, I monitored your disheartening and distressing comments to the warden this morning. Do you actually long for chaos and disharmony? Your fascination with the vulgar Twentieth Century seems to be affecting your better judgement. You realize you're setting a bad example for other officers and sworn personnel...
HUXLEY=>Thank you for the attitude readjustment, Chief Earle. Info assimilated.
HUXLEY=>Sanctimonious asshole.
MORALITY BOX=>Lenina Huxley, you are fined one half credit for a sotto voce violation of the verbal morality statute.
GARCIA=>Whew... That was tense.
HUXLEY=>That was tense?? Tell me something, Garcia, don't you get bored codetracing perps who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?
GARCIA=>Actually, I find my job deeply fulfilling. I just cannot swallow the reality of this office, Lenina Huxley. You're still addicted to the 20th Century high from its harshness, buzzed by its brutality. Holy smokes, is there anything in here which doesn't violate contraband ordinance 22?
HUXLEY=>Just you, Alfredo Garcia. Don't you ever want something to happen?
GARCIA=>Goodness. No.
HUXLEY=>I knew you were going to say that. What I wouldn't give for some action.
SMITHERS=>Mr. Phoenix, one of our first and most illustrious members. Let's get this one over quick...
SMITHERS=>Twenty-nine years ago, the parole system...
PHOENIX=>Twenty-nine years ago, the parole system...
SMITHERS=>... was rendered obsolete.
PHOENIX=>... was rendered obsolete.
SMITHERS=>Do you have something to say in your behalf, Mr. Simon? I thought not.
PHOENIX=>Yeah. Yeah, I do. Teddy bear.
PHOENIX=>I have no idea... Simon says, too much talking from you.
FEMALE COMPUTER=>Access granted, Warden William Smithers.
FEMALE COMPUTER=>Thank you. And BE well.
PHOENIX=>Yeah? You too.
FEMALE COMPUTER=>One eight seven. One eight seven. One eight seven...
TOUGH COP=>Oh my, oh my, oh my...
GARCIA=>What's a one eight seven?
HUXLEY=>Murder-Death-Kill.
COMPUTER=>I show two stopped codes at Cryo-Prison X23-1. William Smithers, Warden. Severe injury. Do you wish to assign a medic?
COMPUTER=>Update: specification deceased. Do you wish to assign a coroner?
CHIEF EARLE=>What's the matter with all of you?
TOUGH COP=>Cryo-Prison, sir... Three non- sanctioned life terminations... Murder-Death-Kills. Three MDKs.
PHOENIX=>Excuse me, Doctor?
DOCTOR=>Yes...
PHOENIX=>Open your mouth and say 'Ahhhh!'
HUXLEY=>Access the Cryo-pen's morning hearing schedule... And then give me... wait...
LAMB=>It's Phoenix. Simon Phoenix...
LAMB=>I knew him. We all knew him. He's evil like you've only read about, girl. He's...
HUXLEY=>Hold that thought, Zachary Lamb. Simon Phoenix's code. Now.
FEMALE COMPUTER=>There are no specifications on file for Simon Phoenix.
HUXLEY=>L7, you're not coming down with another virus, are you? What's Phoenix's code!
LAMB=>You don't get it, Lenina Huxley. Phoenix isn't coded. He got chilled back in the 20th, before they started lojacking everybody ... I was a rookie then... He was a big dealer. Narcotics. Software. Wetware. Anything. Declared his own kingdom in South Central L.A. M.D.K.'d whatever got in his way. In a bad time, he was the worst.
FEMALE COMPUTER=>One stopped code in penitentiary parking area. John Mostow, doctor.
HUXLEY=>Tell me, L7... Is the doctor's conveyance still in the parking zone?
FEMALE COMPUTER=>Doctor's vehicle has been code- fixed at the corner of Hollywood and Vine.
HUXLEY=>Glorious.
CHIEF EARLE=>Fine work. All nearby units. ProtecServe Hollywood and Vine.
TROUBLED-LOOKING GUY=>I dunno... Lately I just don't feel like there's anything special about me...
MALE COMPUTER=>You are an incredibly sensitive man, who inspires Joy-Joy feelings in all those around you...
MALE COMPUTER=>You look great today.
PHOENIX=>Thanks, feel great, too...
MAIL COMPUTER=>You have reached secure mailbox facilities for... Simon Phoenix.
PHOENIX=>Wonder if I can play the accordion now too...
MALE COMPUTER=>Noun: Gun. Portable firearm. This device was widely utilized in the urban wars of the late 20th Century. Referred to as a gun, a pistol, a piece...
PHOENIX=>I don't want a history lesson, Hal! Where are the fucking guns?!
MORALITY BOX=>You are fined one credit for violation of the verbal morality statute.
PHOENIX=>Yeah? Well fuck you twice.
MORALITY BOX=>Your repeated violation of the verbal morality statute has caused me to notify the San Angeles Police Department. Please remain here for your reprimand.
PHOENIX=>Oooh, fuckers are fast, too.
GARCIA=>Chalk one up for the benevolent ones.
SQUAD LEADER=>Maniac is imminent. Request advice.
STRATEGIC APPREHENSION COMPUTER=>With a firm tone of voice, demand maniac lie down with hands behind back.
SQUAD LEADER=>Simon Phoenix, lie down and put your hands behind your back.
PHOENIX=>Geez gosh. Six of you. In such tidy uniforms. I'm so scared.
PHOENIX=>Don't they have irony anymore?
SQUAD LEADER=>Maniac scoffs at us.
S.A.C.=>Approach, and in an even firmer tone of voice...
PHOENIX=>Sarcasm? Will you be staying to die, or running away in fear?
PHOENIX=>Ahhh, I didn't say running away would help.
PHOENIX=>Simon says scream.
PHOENIX=>Everybody stand!
PHOENIX=>... and the home of the... ... brave.
HUXLEY=>We've lost every camera for six blocks around. Going to Cahuenga at twelve hundred millimeters.
GARCIA=>He's going for the vehicle battery core. Its capacitance gel.
TOUGH COP=>Why's he doing that?
COCTEAU=>The problem is not the defacement of public buildings. The problem is not the noise pollution of the exploding devices. The problem is that these hooligans who have left the comfort of our society feel a need to spew hostility at the bosom they have relinquished.
PUBLICWORKS=>Yes, indeed.
COCTEAU=>And mar they may, these halfdozen miscreants infecting the public consciousness with their bile and venom. And while I am saddened, truly saddened, they have left, we cannot allow them to impair the harmony of San Angeles. They are but vandals and Visigoths. Forty-four years ago when Los Angeles exploded in violenceAnger, violenceHatred and violenceFear, a disease had erupted... A disease not socio-economic, but behavioral. People had simply forgotten how to behave... We cannot allow it again. That time, politics, law, even force were useless to affect change... We have triumphed over all of that. The same principles of B.E., Behavioral Engineering, I have applied to cryo-prison were expanded into the design and execution of what we now call... San Angeles, a city as fine as any one of the holding facilities I've designed. We have a peacefulSafe, and above all, happyhappy population.
COCTEAU=>Even now I am positioning actions, postulating proceedings. I expect your trustConfidence and certitude.
LITTER=>As always Mayor/Gov Raymond Cocteau.
COCTEAU=>If you will excuse me.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>Mayor/Gov Raymond Cocteau, a cryocon has effected self-release from the penitentiary. It is quite horrific. Murder- Death-Kills. All categories of chaos...
COCTEAU=>Enhance your calm... Enhance your calm.
COCTEAU=>Be well them for me. Get Captain Earle on the Holo.
EARLE=>It was just... I mean it was so...
COCTEAU=>I want you to do everything in your power to get this madman.
EARLE=>BE well.
EARLE=>He M.D.K.'ed everyone in a six man squad. With a Strategic Apprehension Computer. Destroyed an official government vehicle. 'Everything in our power,' what else is there?
HUXLEY=>Zachary Lamb. How did they apprehend this fiendish Simon Phoenix back in the 20th?
LAMB=>Twelve-state manhunt... Satellite surveillance... A video-bite on 'Unsolved Mysteries'... None of it worked. In the end, it took one man. One cop. John Spartan.
GARCIA=>Are you sure this is real life?
HUXLEY=>Barely. Spartan's a legend. I did an historical study on him last year, which I guess none of you swallowed. One thousand arrests in three years. All real criminals.
LAMB=>There was a lot more business back then.
FEMALE REPORTER=>How do you reconcile the fact you destroyed a three million dollar mini-mall to rescue a girl whose ransom was only 10,000...
LITTLE GIRL=>Fuck you, lady!
SPARTAN=>Good answer.
EARLE=>This is a recommendation? Your 'Demolition man's' an animal, a muscle-bound grotesque who...
HUXLEY=>He is clearly the man for such a job as this. You could reinstate him. He hasn't worn a shield in over forty years. Or much else, for that matter.
GARCIA=>He must be seventy years old by now.
HUXLEY=>This is within the power of the police charter, sir. He can be released on limited parole and reinstated to active duty.
GARCIA=>It's not enough to collect the 90's. You have to bring them back to life...
HUXLEY=>Cocteau said everything in our power. I still can't think of a better idea.
EARLE=>That still doesn't mean it's a good one.
SPARTAN=>You...
SPARTAN=>Where am I?
GARCIA=>Uh, I, uh...
SPARTAN=>When am I?
GARCIA=>Uh, it's Thursday. Tomorrow's Arbor day. And last week you turned eighty- four years old. Happy Birthday.
HUXLEY=>Detective, I'm Lieutenant Huxley. The year is 2042. Now the reason you've been released...
SPARTAN=>How long have I been under?
HUXLEY=>Forty-four years.
SPARTAN=>I had a wife... What happened to my wife?
HUXLEY=>Your wife's light was extinguished in the Big One of 2010. Uh, she died. In an earthquake. The earthquake.
SPARTAN=>My wife and I, we had a girl. A daughter. I made a promise. What...
EARLE=>John Spartan, I am Chief of Police George Earle. We did not thaw you for a family reunion. It is fortunate the lieutenant even did a probe on your wife. This is about you and a Mr. Phoenix. A Mr. Simon Phoenix.
SPARTAN=>What?
HUXLEY=>This morning Phoenix escaped from this cryo facility. We've had nine murder death kills so far. We have become a society of peace, loving and understanding. And we are, quite frankly, not equipped to deal with this situation.
GARCIA=>There have been no deaths of unnatural causes in San Angeles in the last sixteen years.
SPARTAN=>Where???
HUXLEY=>The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, San Diego metroplex merged in 2011. You are in the center of what used to be Los Angeles.
SPARTAN=>Great. Just great. God, I'm so hungry. I'd kill for a burrito.
SPARTAN=>It's just an expression.
SPARTAN=>Just get me some Marlboros.
GARCIA=>Of course. Right away. What are...
SPARTAN=>A cigarette. Just get me any cigarette.
HUXLEY=>Cigarettes are not good for you and it has been deemed that everything that is not good for you is bad. Hence... illegal. Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat...
SPARTAN=>Are you shittin' me?
MORALITY BOX=>John Spartan, you are fined one credit for a violation of verbal morality statute 113.
SPARTAN=>What the fuck is that?
MORALITY BOX=>John Spartan, you are fined one credit for a violation of...
HUXLEY=>Bad language, chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys, and anything spicy. Abortion's also illegal, but then again so's pregnancy if you don't have a license.
EARLE=>Caveman, let us finish all the Rip Van Winkle and get moving. A Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.
SPARTAN=>Uh-uh. I tracked that dirtbag for two years, and when I finally brought him down, they turned me into an ice cube for my trouble. Thanks, but no thanks.
EARLE=>The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the S.A.P.D. and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Simon Phoenix, or you can go back into cryo-stasis. Not many people get a second chance, John Spartan.
SPARTAN=>What am I supposed to be, a drum major? This isn't a cop uniform. Am I gonna lead the Rose Bowl parade? What is all this stuff?
HUXLEY=>Direct biolink readouts for vitals, VOX radio connect, base and inter officer coded by rank, partner status and case priority. And that's the pocket for your whistle.
SPARTAN=>Great, in case one of the floats gets loose I can direct traffic.
GARCIA=>This all probably seems quasi- strange to you.
SPARTAN=>Quasi-strange? This isn't my city. How do you expect me to protect it? I don't get you people, let alone like you much...
HUXLEY=>You come from a society in which the average l8-year-old has witnessed 200,000 acts of simulated violence. In our society the number is closer to four. If someone off the street was to watch the Three Stooge Men and see the Moe-person hammer the Curly-person, they would weep, John Spartan, weep.
HUXLEY=>Myself, I'm a bit of an afficanado of the shocking, real and fiction. In fact, I perused many a News Disk of you. That time you wow- fully tractor-pulled the Santa Monica pier into a heap of rubble in order to snare that team of hit men who...
HUXLEY=>You seem very much alone, John Spartan. Not everything is that different. Perhaps you would like to hear the oldies station. 'Oldies.'
RADIO=>'Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. Almond Joy's got nuts, Mounds don't. Because sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.'
GARCIA=>The most popular station in town. Nonstop wall-to-wall minitunes. You called them commercials. Wow, this is my fave...
RADIO=>'Fat kids, skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks. Tough kids, sissy kids.'
HUXLEY/GARCIA=>Even kids with chicken pox love hot dogs, Armour hot dogs. The dogs... kids... love... to bite.
SPARTAN=>Somebody put me back in the fridge.
HUXLEY=>New inforama on Simon Phoenix?
TOUGH COP=>None... So where is John Spartan?
GARCIA=>He went to the bathroom... I guess he got all thawed out.
TOUGH COP=>Sir, I formally convey my presence.
SPARTAN=>Hi.
HUXLEY=>We're not used to physical contact greetings.
SPARTAN=>Oh... Hey, you guys are out of toilet paper...
GARCIA=>Toilet paper?
HUXLEY=>They used handfuls of wadded paper, back in the 20th.
SPARTAN=>I'm happy you're happy but in the place where you're supposed to have toilet paper, you have a little shelf with three seashells on it.
PERKY DISPATCHER=>He doesn't know how to use the three seashells!
SPARTAN=>Zach Lamb, what happened to you?!
LAMB=>I got old. It happens.
SPARTAN=>Motherfuck. You were a snotnosed punkass rook! Look at you. You're fucking old!
MORALITY BOX=>John Spartan, you are fined three credits for a violation...
SPARTAN=>Shit, fuck, piss, crap, damn, bitch, bitch, damn. Fuck.
SPARTAN=>So much for the three seashells. I'll be right back.
HUXLEY=>Simon Phoenix isn't coded. An organically bioengineered microchip was developed that could by sewn into the skin. Sensors all around the city can zero in on anyone at any time.
TOUGH COP=>I can't even conceive a visual of what you cops did before it was developed...
SPARTAN=>We worked for a living. This fascist crap makes me wanna puke.
EARLE=>What do you think you're scratching, caveman? You really surmise we'd let you out without control? Your code was implanted the second you thawed.
SPARTAN=>Why didn't you just shove a leash up my ass?!
EARLE=>Dirty meat-eater! No matter how Viking your era was, I cannot digest how you ever wore a badge! You're going back, John Spartan, oh yes, you're going back.
HUXLEY=>Could you two please dump some hormones? We need every cortex we can get in this situation.
EARLE=>We don't need him. Our computer has already examined all feasible scenarios resulting from the appearance of Simon Phoenix and determined he will attempt to start up a new drug lab and form a crime syndicate.
FEMALE COMPUTER=>That is correct, Chief George Earle.
SPARTAN=>I hate to interrupt you two lovebirds, but that's fucking stupid. You think he wants to build a business? Phoenix is going for a gun. Plain and simple.
SPARTAN=>Phoenix is a complete meglomaniacal fucking psychopath. And the first thing Simon is going to want to do is wipe the smug smiles off your shiny faces. He could just handshake your asses to death, but who's got the goddamn patience. Trust me, he's going for a gun.
EARLE=>Who cares what this primate thinks. Resonate some understanding. The only place a person can even view a gun in this city, is at a... museum!
MUSEUM COMPUTER BOX=>If you care to sample what it was like to spend a day in Los Angeles in the Twentieth Century please press the button.
PHOENIX=>Home sweet home...
SPARTAN=>It's a hunch. Trust me on this. It's a cop thing. I'm driving.
SPARTAN=>You're driving.
COCTEAU=>Enhance your calm, Chief. Please, share your disquietude.
EARLE=>Mayor/Gov Cocteau, we find the branching possibility exists the escaped cryocon, Mr. Simon Phoenix, may be on his way to the Museum of Art and History in your complex.
COCTEAU=>What permutation lead you to this curious conclusion? Do you expect him to be homesick?
EARLE=>No. No, sir. Do you not still have the armory exhibit downstairs?
PHOENIX=>This is the future. Where are the fucking phaser guns?
MUSEUM GUARD=>Mellow greetings. What seems to be your boggle?
PHOENIX=>My boggle... I'm at the top of the food chain, ya know? And I would prefer to use tools, not bruise up my hands and feet. But I can't find anything in this place. A rock, a crowbar, any heavy object. Tell me, whatta you weigh?
PHOENIX=>Enough...
PHOENIX=>Motherfuck.
MUSEUM COMPUTER=>That's a great looking shirt.
MUSEUM COMPUTER=>Yes, Museum Patron. Have you a query?
PHOENIX=>Whatsa matter with the... Magnetic Accelerator gun?
MUSEUM COMPUTER=>The Magnetic Accelerator gun, the last produced handheld weapon of this millenium displaced the flow of neutrons through a non-linear cycloid supercooled electromagnetic force.
PHOENIX=>So... what? It needs new batteries? What size? Who sells batteries in the future? Is there a battery store I can go to?
MUSEUM COMPUTER=>The AcMag, now reactivated, should concurrently supercool and achieve fission in...two point six minutes.
PHOENIX=>Yeah, well, I was considering leaving quickly and patience is not one of my virtues. Who am I kidding? I don't have any virtues.
SPARTAN=>You see that?
GARCIA=>What?
SPARTAN=>Never mind. I give up trying to figure this place out.
GARCIA=>(holding out his
S.A.C.)=>Procedure?
S.A.C.=>Establish communication with maniac intruder.
SPARTAN=>Wrong. Hey. Luke Skywalker. Use the Force.
SPARTAN=>What the hell's this?
GARCIA=>It's a glow rod. It's what we got.
SPARTAN=>Does it work?
SPARTAN=>Guess so.
HUXLEY=>They've got him trapped in section eight.
SPARTAN=>Trapped? The Maniac Intruder? That I doubt. Oh, would you make sure for me that nobody else is in the building?
HUXLEY=>Done. I want a visual. Now. Every corridor in the museum. I want full sensors routed to me. And I want it ninety seconds ago...
PHOENIX=>What can I say, I'm a blast from the past.
SPARTAN=>Simon Phoenix. L.A.P.D., I mean San Angeles P.D. You're under arrest.
PHOENIX=>Nah. I don't think so.
SPARTAN=>Hands up or I'll shoot, Simon. Fuck it.
PHOENIX=>You were saying... Spartan! John Spartan! What's a guy like you doing in a century like this?
SPARTAN=>My job.
PHOENIX=>Who cares? Simon says bleed.
PHOENIX=>Come on, motherfucker. Well, we'll do it the old- fashioned way...
PHOENIX=>So lemme get this straight -- they defrosted you just to lassoo my piddly ass?
SPARTAN=>I was in the neighborhood.
PHOENIX=>Nice shooting, Spartan. You killed the building.
PHOENIX=>Past is over, Spartan. Time for something new and improved. Like me... Now die.
SPARTAN=>You forgot to say Simon says.
PHOENIX=>What a brave new world. Sorry you have to leave.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>I'm sure, sir, the Stress Breeder is inside being demobilized as we speak...
PHOENIX=>Damn, being frozen has thrown off my aim. Don't worry, I'll kill you with the next shot.
COCTEAU=>I don't think so.
COCTEAU=>Ah, no kiss-kiss. No bang-bang... And you were doing so well. Now, don't you have a job to do? Don't you have someone you have to kill?
PHOENIX=>Yeah, I do...
SPARTAN=>You don't know how fucking lucky you are that maniac didn't whack you.
COCTEAU=>No doubt whacking, whatever it is, would be extremely bad. You scared him away and I do not know how to thank you. You saved my life.
HUXLEY=>Not bad for an eighty-four-year- old! Simon Phoenix knows he has some competition. He's finally matched his meat. You really licked his ass!
SPARTAN=>Uh, it's 'met his match.' And 'kicked.' Kicked' his ass.
COCTEAU=>Who is this man?
EARLE=>Detective John Spartan. Temporarily reinstated to the San Angeles Police Department to pursue the madman Simon Phoenix. You told us to do everything in our power to capture the madman.
COCTEAU=>I did. Yes. Yes, I did. I do recall the exploits of John Spartan. Didn't they call him... I think it was... The Demolition Man. It's quite all right, Chief. Unexpected, creative, but quite all right. BE Well.
COCTEAU=>John Spartan, welcome. So, what do you think of our fair society?
SPARTAN=>Great, I come to the future, Phoenix gets the ray gun, I get the rusty Beretta.
COCTEAU=>John Spartan, in honor of your arrival, and your protection of the sanctity of human life, namely my own, I wish for you to join me for dinner tonight. The both of you. I insist. You must accompany me to Taco Bell.
SPARTAN=>Uh. That'd be great. Looking forward to it...
SPARTAN=>Wait, wait, wait.
SPARTAN=>Spacely Sprockets here, who is now in charge, the 'Mayor/Gov,' who wants to take me to dinner at Taco Bell -- though Lord knows I wouldn't mind a burrito -- is also one of the guys who invented the cryoprison?!
EARLE=>Dr. Cocteau is the most important man in San Angeles. He practically created our whole way of life. Savage!
SPARTAN=>Well he can have it. And rather than inserting barbed instruments up the rectums of those around you, perhaps you would care to sit on one yourself.
SPARTAN=>Phoenix could be anywhere, but not having a code could hurt him. Limits his options.
HUXLEY=>Correct. Money is outmoded. All transactions are through codes.
SPARTAN=>So Phoenix can't buy food or a place to crash for the night. Pointless for him to mug anybody... Unless he rips off someone's hand. Let's hope he doesn't figure that one out...
GARCIA=>And with all officers already patrolling in a citywide crisis net, it should be just a matter of tick-tocks before...
EARLE=>And you know, we already have a back-up plan. We can just wait for another code to go red. When Phoenix performs another murderdeathkill, we'll know exactly where to pounce...
SPARTAN=>Oh. Great plan.
EARLE=>Thank you.
SPARTAN=>So where the fuck is he?
PHOENIX=>No front door, no welcome mat, what's with these people? How you supposed to show up and kill somebody?
HUXLEY=>I've been an enthusiast of your escapades for quite some time. I have, in fact, perused some actual newsreels of you at the Schwarzenegger library. The time you drove your car through that...
SPARTAN=>Back up. The Schwarzenegger library...
HUXLEY=>Yes, the Schwarzenegger Presidential Library. Wasn't he an actor when you...
SPARTAN=>Stop... He was President?
HUXLEY=>Even though he was not born in this country, his popularity at the time caused the 61st Amendment which states...
SPARTAN=>I don't want to know...
SPARTAN=>I keep looking around, thinking about my daughter growing up in a place like this. I'm afraid she's gonna think I'm some kind of disgusting primate from the past. As much as I want to see her, I almost don't wanna know. I'm not gonna fit into the picture very well.
HUXLEY=>It would be a minor misuse of police powers but I could do a search for you.
SPARTAN=>So, what's with this Cocteau guy? He thanks me for saving his life -- which I'm not sure I did -- invites me to dinner, and where does he take me... Taco Bell. I mean, hey, I like Mexican but come on...
HUXLEY=>Your tone is quasi-facetious. You do not realize Taco Bell was the only restaurant to survive the Franchise Wars. All restaurants are now Taco Bell.
COUNTERGIRL=>Hi! May I help you?
SPARTAN=>Uh, I'll take a Burrito Supreme and a shake?
COUNTERGIRL=>Will that be for here or to go?
SPARTAN=>Ah. The eternal question... Here.
COUNTERGIRL=>Burrito Supreme. Shake. BE well.
SPARTAN=>Oooh. Yum... Good thing I'm hungry.
COCTEAU=>John Spartan, the hero of the hour. I congratulate you.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>Greetings and salutations, I am Associate Bob. We met before, ever so briefly but I was groveling in fear in the humus at the time. You have had quite the exciting first day in San Angeles. Imagine, chasing a real criminal.
SPARTAN=>Imagine. Could someone pass the salt?
HUXLEY=>Salt is not good for you. Hence it is...
COCTEAU=>So, John Spartan, tell me, what do you think of San Angeles, 2042?
SPARTAN=>I guess, considering the way things were going when I went in -- I thought the future would be a sick, decaying pit of suffering and hate with a thick, foul stench.
COCTEAU=>You should consider visiting New York/Jersey after this.
SPARTAN=>You mean nothing's changed?
COCTEAU=>Look at you, John Spartan, pouting for the old cheeseburger -- the flesh of dying animals covered with cholesterol laden butterfat. You miss the bad old days.
SPARTAN=>Yeah, maybe. Look, I like vegetables. I even ate tofu a couple times. But I got to choose when I wanted it.
COCTEAU=>You think we've gone too far? You weren't here for the fourth and fifth riots. Civilization tried to destroy itself. People just wanted the madness over. And when I saw the chance to make things right, I grabbed it. San Angeles would not be here. It would be your pit of stench.
SPARTAN=>Yeah? Maybe you can book me a flight to New York when this is done.
COCTEAU=>For your crimes, John Spartan, you would have surely rotted and died in jail by now. Even you have to appreciate the persuasively tranquil humanity of the Cryo-Prison system...
SPARTAN=>I don't want to piss on your parade, pal, but my 'cryo- sentence' wasn't a sweet lullaby. I had feelings -- I had thoughts -- a 44 year-old bad dream about thirty people in a burning building -- about my wife, beating her fists against an ice bucket. It woulda been more humane to stake me down and leave me to the crows.
HUXLEY=>You were awake? A person would go insane.
COCTEAU=>I am saddened and stunned. If there's anything I can do...
SPARTAN=>Just call for back-up. I'll be across the street.
HUXLEY=>But, John Spartan, why... How, wha...
SPARTAN=>One of those hunch things again. Bad guys about to do bad things...
SPARTAN=>Great, they brought the whole team.
SPARTAN=>Now if we can just get them to stay and play...
TROLLEY DRIVER=>BE well...?
SPARTAN=>Be gone.
SPARTAN=>You're all under arrest.
SCRAP RAIDER=>Protein! I've found protein!!
SPARTAN=>You're going to regret this for the rest of your life. Both seconds of it.
SPARTAN=>Maybe I'm losing my touch.
SPARTAN=>Better.
PAYNE=>We're outta here!
HURLED SCRAP=>Please... don't...
HUXLEY=>Such a reckless abandonment! Looks like there's a new shepherd in town!
SPARTAN=>'Sheriff'... Who were those guys?
COCTEAU=>We call them Scraps. Voluntary outcasts, they cower beneath us in sewers, abandoned tunnels...
ASSOCIATE BOB=>They're nothing but thugs and hooligans.
HUXLEY=>You are even better live than on laserdisc. Oh, and the joyjoy way you paused to make a glib witticism before doing battle with that strangely-weaponed Scrap it was so, so...
SPARTAN=>Hey, this isn't the Wild West. The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West. Hurting people is not a good time. Well, sometimes it is... but not when it's just a bunch of guys who want something to eat. You know, I think I liked it better when we were all supposed to fry in a nuclear holocaust.
HUXLEY=>Huxley, coding off.
SPARTAN=>Hey, look, I'm sorry I yelled before... back there.
HUXLEY=>No need to make a dehurtful retraction. I've assimilated too much contraband. I fleshed you as some blow-up-the-bad-guys- with-a-happy-grin-he-man type, but I realize now you're the moody- troubled-past-gunslinger-who-only- draws-when-he-must.
SPARTAN=>Huxley. Stop. I'm not any of that... I'm nothing.
HUXLEY=>Oh, hey, here's what you asked for... Why do you...
SPARTAN=>Thanks. It's just a... hunch.
SPARTAN=>This is where you live?
HUXLEY=>You, too. I have procured you a domicile down the corridor from my own.
HUXLEY=>Everything is voice-coded. So if you need something...
HUXLEY=>... just ask. Lights.
HUXLEY=>What do you think? I clicked off a lot of credits to create the perfect 20th Century apartment.
SPARTAN=>It's very...
HUXLEY=>Isn't it? John Spartan, there is of course a well-known and documented connection between sex and violence. Not so much a causal effect, but a state of general neurological arousal.
HUXLEY=>And after observing your behavior and my resultant condition, I was wondering if you would like to have sex?
SPARTAN=>With you? Now? Ahhh, ahhh, mmm, yeah.
HUXLEY=>Great.
HUXLEY=>Now you have to relax. We'll start in a few seconds.
SPARTAN=>Start what?
HUXLEY=>Having sex, of course.
HUXLEY=>What's wrong? You broke contact.
SPARTAN=>Contact? I haven't even touched you yet!
HUXLEY=>But... but I thought you wanted to make love.
SPARTAN=>This is like boning Ms. Pacman.
HUXLEY=>Vir-sex has been proven to produce higher orders of alpha waves during digitized transference of sexual energies!
SPARTAN=>Waddya say we just do this the old-fashioned way?
HUXLEY=>Uuuugh. You mean... fluid transfer?!
SPARTAN=>Boning, doing the wild mambo, you know... ... the hunka chunka.
HUXLEY=>That is no longer done!
HUXLEY=>Exchange of bodily fluids? Do you know what that leads to?
SPARTAN=>Kids, smoking, a desire to raid the fridge.
HUXLEY=>The rampant exchange of bodily fluids was one of the major reasons for the downfall of society. After AIDS there was NRS. After NRS there was UBT. One of the first things Dr. Cocteau was able to do was outlaw and behaviorally engineer all fluid transfer out of societally-acceptable behavior. Not even mouth transfer is condoned.
SPARTAN=>There's no kissing anymore...? I was a good kisser...
HUXLEY=>Ughh.
SPARTAN=>What about kids?
HUXLEY=>Procreation? We go to the lab. Fluids are purified, screened and transferred by authorized medical personnel only. Ugh. Ugh...
SPARTAN=>I didn't...
HUXLEY=>You are a savage creature. John Spartan, I wish you to leave my domicile now!
SPARTAN=>Ahh. Lights.
NUDE WOMAN=>Hi, Martin! I was thinki -- ohmyGod! I'm sorry, wrong number --
SPARTAN=>Uh, telephone directory...
VIDSCREEN COMPUTER=>Videophone directory accessed. Spartan almost bails, but finally --
SPARTAN=>Do you have a number for a Katie, I guess it's Katherine now, Spartan? Or maybe under her mom's name, Warren, or... ... her mom might have even re-remarried. But she's passed away now...
VIDSCREEN COMPUTER=>Katie Spartan. No ref. Katherine Spartan. No ref. Katherine Warren. No current ref.
SPARTAN=>Was there one?
VIDSCREEN COMPUTER=>Listed offspring under Madeline Warren through 2010. Listed different number domicile until
SPARTAN=>What happened then?
VIDSCREEN COMPUTER=>No ref.
SPARTAN=>Did she die?
VIDSCREEN COMPUTER=>No death certificate issued. No ref.
SPARTAN=>Good thing she didn't die without permission. Did she move?
VIDSCREEN COMPUTER=>No relocation license granted. No ref.
SPARTAN=>Reason for 'no ref'?
VIDSCREEN COMPUTER=>What number do you wish to call? Hangs up on him.
COCTEAU=>Lights.
PHOENIX=>Nah, I changed that. Illuminate.
PHOENIX=>Illuminate. Isn't that nicer? Go 'head, you try it.
COCTEAU=>Illuminate.
PHOENIX=>Raymond, bud, we need to talk.
COCTEAU=>How'd you get in?
PHOENIX=>I wish I knew. Access codes, routes to secret underground kingdoms, the words to songs I thought I forgot... I've been meaning to ask you about this. I can do almost anything. I like this. A lot.
COCTEAU=>Your skills were given to you for a reason. Not for your personal amusement. Your job is to kill this nuisance, Thomas Payne no one else in San Angeles can perform this simple task anymore -- and not to allow him to wreak any more surface harassing havoc. And your ineptitude allowed it to grow worse tonight.
PHOENIX=>'Ineptitude.' Now I'd say that's a bit of a provocative word, Raymond. Have you ever been down to the Wasteland? Has anyone you know been down there?? No? Oooh. It's bad down there. Really bad. It's a wonder I got out of there alive. It's gonna be a big problem. I'm gonna need five or six more guys. Easy. You gotta list? 'Cause I don't wanna defrost no serial killers or mad dog types.
COCTEAU=>So you're gonna be the only mad dog type?
PHOENIX=>Exactemundo.
COCTEAU=>Fine. Take care of it. Just get it over with... You're beginning to be more trouble than you're worth.
PHOENIX=>Aww, don't say that...
PHOENIX=>What the hell is Spartan doing here, Raymond? Who invited him to our party?
COCTEAU=>Finish your business and I'll stuff him back in the freezer. Think of him as a guarantee.
PHOENIX=>I took care of Spartan before, don't worry your pointy little head about it. Now to avoid this ineptitude, we need these guys thawed...
PHOENIX=>Illuminate.
COCTEAU=>Illuminate.
PHOENIX=>Nah, I changed it again. See ya...
ASSOCIATE BOB=>What a distasteful fellow.
COCTEAU=>Oh shut up, Bob.
HUXLEY=>Detective...
SPARTAN=>I've got to learn to do this sometime.
SPARTAN=>This is for you, Huxley.
HUXLEY=>Oh, thanks...
HUXLEY=>What a lovely...
SPARTAN=>I don't know what they put in my Cryoslush, but I thaw out and the first thing I want to do is... knit. How come I know what a zipper foot is, a shuttle, hook and bobbin, petitpoint. I could weave a throw rug right now with my eyes closed.
HUXLEY=>It was your rehab training. For each inmate the computer draws up a skill or trade which best suits their genetic disposition. It implants the knowledge and desire to carry out whatever training was assigned.
SPARTAN=>I'm a 'seamstress?' Seamstress. Great. How come I come out of cryoprison and I'm Betsy fucking Ross and Phoenix comes out and he can access computers, operate all vehicles, find the locations of every damn thing in the city? Can you get me Phoenix's rehab program?
SWEET FEMALE COMPUTER=>Phoenix, Simon. Rehabilitation skills; Urban combatkill, torture methodology, computer override authorization, violent...
SPARTAN=>Who develops the rehab programs? Attila the Hun?
HUXLEY=>Cocteau Industries of course. But why would Cocteau want to provoke madness? He's always been obsessed with one thing...
SPARTAN=>Yeah... control. The success of his favorite restaurants. The end of kissing... I've gotta talk to this asshole.
HUXLEY=>But, John Spartan, you must be mistaken. You can't accuse the savior of the city of being connected to a multi-murder- deathkiller like Simon Phoenix. It's... rude.
SPARTAN=>I'll be subtle. I'm good at subtle.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>I am ever so sorry, John Spartan, but Dr. Raymond Cocteau is not here for your unannounced visit. I don't think I can access him at this time.
SPARTAN=>Think again.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>I'll give it my utmost efforts, sir.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>Oh wonder of wonders, I have him on FiberOp in the conference room.
COCTEAU=>Mellow apologies for my lack of physical disposition, Detective, but I do have an entire city/gov to run.
SPARTAN=>Run this. You programmed Phoenix's rehab to turn him into a terrorist. Now that you wussed out this entire society in a tribute to yourself you needed Phoenix to handle the cast-offs who wouldn't listen to your bullshit.
COCTEAU=>Phoenix's rehab. Now.
SWEET FEMALE COMPUTER=>Phoenix, Simon. Rehabilitation skills; Decorative Gardening, Retail Floral Arrangements...
COCTEAU=>What are you speaking of, Detective? My only interest in Simon Phoenix was in that of the creation of an expert Florist.
SPARTAN=>Florist? Phoenix wouldn't know a prickly pear from a pair of pricks.
SPARTAN=>Try again.
SPARTAN=>Outside the museum, why didn't he blow your brains out? I saw the security disc. Phoenix had a full ten seconds to think about where to put the hole in your head.
COCTEAU=>John Spartan, this display of barbaric behavior was not acceptable even in your time.
SPARTAN=>Yeah. But it worked.
SPARTAN=>When a man like Phoenix has a gun to your head, ten seconds is nine and a half seconds longer than you live.
COCTEAU=>Not everyone is as eager as you to resort to violence to solve all the difficulties in life. Even now I am beginning to wonder if the fracas in the museum was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence or your own.
SPARTAN=>Wonder about this, shithead. You think you can control this guy? Trust me... you can't.
COCTEAU=>Is there something specific you plan to do with that archaic device?
COCTEAU=>Now, John Spartan, do you not query yourself that this misplaced hostility is the result of your transference of self hatred and personal loathing?
SPARTAN=>What??
COCTEAU=>Perhaps you blame me for my role in the progenation of the cryo process. That does not relieve you of your burden of responsibility for the commitment of your initial crimes.
SPARTAN=>Fuck you.
EARLE=>Please cease this madness, enhance your calm, John Spartan.
SPARTAN=>I've had it with enhancing my calm. I'm going to find Phoenix and enhance his calm instead. I'm the only one here who can handle this situation.
GARCIA=>How will you accomplish this, John Spartan?
SPARTAN=>I'm going to blow his fucking head off.
HUXLEY=>John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix was programmed to escape, extinguish life and steal contraband weapons -- by forces known or unknown -- pray tell why are you proceeding to the depths of Wasteland?
SPARTAN=>The reason the citywide manhunt didn't work was because Phoenix was down in the one place you A, can't monitor, B, are afraid to visit, and C don't give a shit about.
EARLE=>Whether Phoenix is down there or not, you just can't drop in. Resonate some understanding, the Wasteland is filled with thugs and...
SPARTAN=>Hooligans, I know. We might never come back.
EARLE=>Yeah. You might like it down there.
SPARTAN=>You made a joke. There's hope after all. Hey, how bad could it be...
SPARTAN=>Look, you two don't have to do this. I can handle Phoenix.
HUXLEY=>Hey, come on, let's go blow this guy.
SPARTAN=>That's 'blow this guy away.'
HUXLEY=>Whatever.
GARCIA=>'My dog's better than your dog. My dog's better than yours... My dog's better cause he...' Sorry, when I'm nervous, I... Sorry.
SPARTAN=>Thugs and hooligans, huh?
HUXLEY=>I had no idea... we've always been told the only people down here were savages, who wanted only to...
GARCIA=>What is that emanation?
SPARTAN=>Oh, yeah, oh yeah...
SPARTAN=>Thank God, a real burrito... Smokes.
HUXLEY=>I think I'm going to...
OLD WOMAN=>Buenos dias, senor....
GARCIA=>Uh, no thank you...
SPARTAN=>Best damn burritos I ever had.
HUXLEY=>Just don't ask where the meat comes from.
SPARTAN=>What do you mean?
HUXLEY=>Did you see any cows down here, Detective?
SPARTAN=>Que esta esso carne?
OLD WOMAN=>Esta carne de rodentia.
SPARTAN=>Rat burritos. I'm eating a rat burrito.
SPARTAN=>And it was good. Damn fine salsa too.
OLD WOMAN=>Gracias, Senor.
GARCIA=>Oh my...
PHOENIX=>Gentlemen, let's review. It's 2042. That's two oh four two, as in the Twenty-First Century. The world is a pussy-whipped Disney Channel version of itself and all we gotta do to run the whole place is kill this guy, named Raymond, who put it all together. Then as an added bonus, you get to kill the man who put most of us in the freezer, your pal and mine, John Spartan. We can rape, loot, pillage, all the fun things you remember. This place is gonna be like a theme park, but with our kinda themes. Let's get busy.
BEPPO=>We get to kill John Spartan?
PHOENIX=>Over and over and over, if you'd like.
PHOENIX=>Salud.
SPARTAN=>Nice... A 1969 Pontiac LeMans GTO convertible with rear spoiler and hot wheel mags... Seriously beyond the standard package.
VOICE=>So are these. Why don't you put down the glow rods.
PAYNE=>Your friends too. You got ball balls, cop, coming down here after the show you put on...
HUXLEY=>We're looking for a MurderDeath Killer... Can you help? Or just bully us with these primitive weapons?
SPARTAN=>Well, maybe they're not so primitive.
PAYNE=>Not funny, not smart. What do you want, cop?
SPARTAN=>I got a few questions.
SPARTAN=>But if it's a bad time we could come back later.
PAYNE=>It's always a bad time down here for questions.
TOUGH SCRAP=>You've got no business down here.
SPARTAN=>Who are all you people? And why are you down here?
PAYNE=>What's it to you? What the hell do you care?
SPARTAN=>Look, I'm not from here. Well, I am from here, but I'm not from Now. And for all I can see, this whole place is as fucked up as where I'm from... I'd just kinda like to know what's going on.
PAYNE=>Some of us didn't tow the line. Some of us didn't make the grade.
PAYNE=>And some of us just got tired of being told what to do...
SPARTAN=>Guess you people weren't part of the Cocteau plan.
PAYNE=>Man, this is the Cocteau plan.
SPARTAN=>Next time you go shopping, I'm not going to be in your way... Listen, when the laws are wrong, men have to take it upon themselves to change them.
HUXLEY=>John Spartan, you must uphold the law.
SPARTAN=>It's the old story, give up a little freedom for a little safety and soon you have no freedom and no safety.
PAYNE=>You're a pretty wise man.
SPARTAN=>Nah, I'm just fifty years out of date. But I do have another question. We're looking for a guy. Black skin, white hair, one blue eye, bad attitude. He's from my time, and if I don't find him, we're all in trouble.
TOUGH SCRAP=>Scoped him yesterday.
GARCIA=>You were right...
PHOENIX=>You know, I musta done something right in a previous life. Don't know what that coulda been...
KATHERINE=>John Spartan? The Demolition Man?
SPARTAN=>Yeah... Do I know you?
KATHERINE=>You did. I'm your daughter.
SPARTAN=>Katie, my little Katie...
KATHERINE=>Little Kate, I'm older than you...
SPARTAN=>You'll always be my little girl, I don't care how old you are. God, Katie. You're all grown up. I missed your whole life. I missed everything.
KATHERINE=>Mom and I always talked about you. I always hoped I would see you one day. I knew I would.
SPARTAN=>Tell me everything. I want to know everything about you...
KATHERINE=>Everything? All at once?
SPARTAN=>Yes. Absolutely everything. Start where I left off. You were six...
GARCIA=>Spartan.
GARCIA=>Spartan... Spar...
SPARTAN=>What!
SPARTAN=>Get down!!!
PHOENIX=>Spartan, buddy, I brought some old friends.
SPARTAN=>Stay down!
SPARTAN=>Oh shit.
PHOENIX=>Just go with the flow, Spartan.
PHOENIX=>Hey, since we're just hanging out, I have to tell you something -- remember those muni passengers you blew to pieces trying to catch me...? They were already dead, pal, before you even touched the building. Cold as Haagen Dazs. See ya...
SPARTAN=>There's an elevator shaft on top of this place...
HUXLEY=>Then does that mean this place is...
HUXLEY=>Going up?
SPARTAN=>Momentito, Senorita Huxley.
HUXLEY=>Now what?
SPARTAN=>Vaya con dios.
LAMB=>Yeah, the Demo Man is back.
PHOENIX=>So am I. Rookie.
LAMB=>Phoenix... you're still... one ugly sonofabitch.
PHOENIX=>You shouldn't have said that, now I'm going to have to kill you... Ah damn, I forgot, I already did.
SPARTAN=>Lamb!
HUXLEY=>I empathize with your loss.
SPARTAN=>Fuck it.
PHOENIX=>Motherfucker!
PHOENIX=>Auto-inflate!
SPARTAN=>Damn! Take over!
HUXLEY=>What?!
SPARTAN=>Drive!
HUXLEY=>So what, I just push this pedal...
PHOENIX=>Computer: velocity control override!
COMPUTER=>State the nature of the emergency.
PHOENIX=>Arson. Armed robbery! No, it's murder! An entire family is being robbed in a burning building and they're all getting killed.
HUXLEY=>He's accessed velocity override!
SPARTAN=>Don't worry. Punch it.
SPARTAN=>Whoa, whoa, slow down!
PHOENIX=>Open doors! Emergency!
PHOENIX=>Close doors.
PHOENIX=>Computer! Disengage Auxilliary Battery Pod now!
SPARTAN=>Move over!
TRUCK DRIVER=>Oh dear! Don't hurt me, please don't hurt me!
EARLE=>You... You... Menace!
SPARTAN=>Yeah.
HUXLEY=>John Spartan, I thought your life force had been prematurely terminated. Look at you, you're in shambles.
SPARTAN=>Thought I was fucked this time too. Don't worry. I can fix this later. All I need's a needle and thread.
SPARTAN=>I need something, anything, a shotgun, a flare gun... Holy shit...
EARLE=>Stun batons on!
SPARTAN=>You get a bump on the noggin and you're Pancho Villa.
GARCIA=>Who?
SPARTAN=>Never mind. Loan me a gun. Loan me two guns.
SPARTAN=>What else you got?
EARLE=>You would have used these weapons of mass destruction against the men and women who upheld the law?!
PAYNE=>We would have used these weapons to shop for groceries.
PAYNE=>Look, Chief, I've had it with being a criminal. I'm not a criminal. Think of me more as the head of the people's militia. We're gonna go dump the tea in the harbor, ya know?
EARLE=>That's good, cause tea contains caffeine.
SPARTAN=>You're joking again, right? Grin or something afterwards, people don't know.
HUXLEY=>Who are these swarthy strangers?
SPARTAN=>I know these guys. I arrested them years ago... Albert Collins, 22 known murders. Beppo Zemoto, I don't even want to talk about what he did. And they're out. There were more too...
HUXLEY=>I once checked, prior to your arrest, 45 out of 200 members of the multilife sentence wing of the cryoprison were your arrests.
SPARTAN=>Right now, that's not a very reassuring statistic...
KATHERINE=>Hey. Dad.
KATHERINE=>Here. You gave me this.
KATHERINE=>Don't get killed. Maybe we'll get to know each other.
SPARTAN=>That'd be good.
KATHERINE=>I didn't tell you I loved you.
SPARTAN=>You don't have to.
HUXLEY=>Don't hit anything.
SPARTAN=>Whattya mean? I'm an excellent driver.
COCTEAU=>I wasn't counting on this, but I must say you've worked out beautifully. People are terrified of you.
PHOENIX=>Ah, people have always been terrified of me.
COCTEAU=>But this time they're truly scared. Soon they'll want to take the next step -- security cameras in every room, stricter alarm systems against misbehavior, anonymous hotlines to their neighbor's infractions... I'll have carte blanche now to create the perfect society. Everyone will want it. An enzyme injection for all citizens that will insure everyone has the same I.Q., the same weight, and the same desire to think only happy thoughts.
PHOENIX=>I'm pretty happy now. I think I'll pass on that shot.
COCTEAU=>Other cities will follow. San Angeles will be a beacon of order with the purity of an ant colony and the beauty of a flawless pearl.
PHOENIX=>Nah. You can't take away people's right to be assholes. That's it, that's who you remind me of -- an evil Mr. Rogers.
PHOENIX=>You try to kill him. This is beginning to piss me off.
PHOENIX=>So what shall I do with you, Bob?
ASSOCIATE BOB=>I am an excellent associate, sir. I could work for you. Dr. Cocteau actually had me endocrinecologically altered to never wish to be anything but an associate.
PHOENIX=>What??
ASSOCIATE BOB=>I believe the slang that would best express it across our chronological gap, sir, would be that he -- cut my balls off.
PHOENIX=>Literally?
PHOENIX=>Bob, it's a sign of weakness to cut the balls off the people who work for you. I'm gonna get you a new set.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>Why, thank you, sir.
PHOENIX=>Can we do that now?
PHOENIX=>I'm gonna get a couple extra myself. Not that I need 'em. But just for spares...
ASSOCIATE BOB=>If I could interrupt...
ASSOCIATE BOB=>But the police are here.
PHOENIX=>I'm gonna need to defrost more guys, Bob. Lots more guys. Can you do that?
ASSOCIATE BOB=>Indubitably. But the computer codes will have to emanate from this office. We will need a few moments here before fleeing. I might suggest that the, uh, large gentlemen might be considered, ah... ...disposable. Especially with rather large supply forthcoming. Perhaps they could be sent to welcome Mr. Spartan. If they succeed, so much the better, if not, they will at least hinder his progress?
PHOENIX=>I like you, Bob. You have no heart. Guys, John Spartan's on his way. Go downstairs. Kill him.
DANZIG=>Over and over and over...
PHOENIX=>Now, really, violent evil multi- lifers. I want guys who understand that crimes come in bunches. Not just a sporadic bit of violence or law breaking here and there. I want guys who've been on killing sprees before. Men who've crossed state lines with impunity! Do you understand me, Bob?
ASSOCIATE BOB=>Perfectly, sir.
PHOENIX=>I'm gonna like running this place.
SPARTAN=>Old trick.
HUXLEY=>Old criminals.
SPARTAN=>Elvin!
SPARTAN=>Thought it was you.
HUXLEY=>This man has died at my hands. I have taken all his future from him...
SPARTAN=>Him or you, Huxley.
HUXLEY=>There is that.
HUXLEY=>Horrors. Oh horrors. Sic Transit Raymond Cocteau. Oh, John Spartan, civilization as we know it will come to an end.
SPARTAN=>It does that every once in a while.
SPARTAN=>What's this?
HUXLEY=>Ooh. This is bad. Very bad. He's accessed the cryoprison. He's about to defrost the entire multilifer wing. Most of them don't like you.
SPARTAN=>Most of them didn't even like their mothers. These are bad people. How many?
HUXLEY=>Eighty.
SPARTAN=>We have to stop that.
HUXLEY=>All units, all units. ProtectServe Cryoprison. Simon Phoenix assumed to be en route. Should I announce the demise of Doctor Raymond Cocteau?
SPARTAN=>Nah. I think we're gonna cause enough panic on our own.
GARCIA=>He's inside already. And it's completely sealed.
SPARTAN=>This is crime against nature...
HUXLEY=>Okay, look, I wasn't at all pleased to cause the fatality of that deranged cryocon, but I understand now that sometimes under particular circumstances that violence is necessary...
SPARTAN=>Good.
SPARTAN=>Then you'll understand this.
SPARTAN=>Hang on to her. See she doesn't get herself into trouble.
GARCIA=>You too.
SPARTAN=>Yeah.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>Doctor Cocteau would want every bit of haste from you! If he was still extant that is.
ASSOCIATE BOB=>There's been a breach in the outer gate. An intruder has entered the CryoFacility and I feel it's safe to assume it's John Spartan.
PHOENIX=>Got some really wild uppers? Speed, crank, amphetamines? Anything?
MED TECH=>We have pure megadrenalin, sir.
PHOENIX=>Good. Whack these guys with it. A bunch.
PHOENIX=>Hey wake up. Good. Listen to me. You've just been defrosted. It's the future. John Spartan is out those doors. Go kill him.
COCTEAU=>Greetings, and BE well.
SPARTAN=>Fine. Take it.
PHOENIX=>So, who's left that's good? Ooooh, Ramon Gutieriz? We gotta get him.
PHOENIX=>Come on...
PHOENIX=>Go...
PHOENIX=>Don't you understand the meaning of give up? You're too late, John. I've got three more batches in the oven.
PHOENIX=>Where the fuck you going?
ASSOCIATE BOB=>I wish you good luck, sir. This is an activity that requires testicles.
PHOENIX=>True 'nuf.
PHOENIX=>Take those stairs, I'll cover you.
PHOENIX=>No brains either.
ANGRY CRYOCON=>Spartan!!!
MANY ANGRY CRYOCONS=>Kill him!! Kill him!!!!!
SPARTAN=>All right, who's next???
SPARTAN=>I think it's time to go.
KATHERINE=>Good to see you again, Dad. Come by sometime for dinner. I'll cook.
HUXLEY=>That was it? That's the whole kissing thing? What was Cocteau so worried about?
HUXLEY=>Oh. My. Is the rest of fluid transfer activities like this?
SPARTAN=>Better.
HUXLEY=>Better??! Oh. My.
HUXLEY=>Welcome to the future, John Spartan. Now that you've destroyed everything.
SPARTAN=>Yeah, I think I'm gonna like it here. There's one thing I want to know though. How does that damn three seashells thing work?
