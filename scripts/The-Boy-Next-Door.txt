A CLEARING=>poised on the brink of the ravine. Quiet. Mossy. A sylvan paradise, complete with a TIRE SWING hanging from a tree. Claire breathes heavily as she stretches against the fallen sycamore. Eventually, her gaze wanders to a WEATHERED CARVING on its trunk: “C.P. + G.P” encircled in a heart. Her eyes darken. Her watch BEEPS, pulling her back to the present. She hurries off toward a COLONIAL-STYLE HOME in the distance.
VICKY=>We’ll see ...
CLAIRE=>I have no idea.
NOAH’S FACE=>Magnetic eyes. Confident smile. Boyish, yet possessing a solemn quality that suggests an old soul living deep inside.
GARY=>There we go ...
MAN=>Promise you’ll call me if there’s any problem?
NOAH=>Don’t worry.
NOAH=>She died a few years ago in a car accident.
NOAH=>You think I got a shot at getting into your class?
STOOGE=>Maybe it’s a AK47.
KEVIN=>Believe me Zimmer, you’d be the first to know. JASON
CLAIRE=>Yeah, fine.
NOAH=>I didn’t mean -- CLAIRE
CLAIRE=>What? Tell me.
NOAH=>You’re soaked.
NOAH’S WINDOW=>Dark, lifeless. No way to tell if he’s there. She contemplates it. Then, with the curtains still open, she UNZIPS HER DRESS and lets it drop to the floor. She stands there, unflinching, in nothing but LACY BLACK UNDERWEAR. Slowly, her hands travel to the front of her bra. They tremble as they unhook the clasp. She hesitates, then pulls it open. Her BARE BREASTS spring forth. She breathes heavily, electrified. Then, gathering all her courage, she slips off her panties.
HER NAKED BODY=>stands erect but quivers with fear and arousal. For what seems like an eternity, she stares out at Noah’s window, completely vulnerable, baring her body and soul. Finally, unable to endure it any longer, she raises both arms and pulls the curtains shut. Alone now, her body shakes uncontrollably. She sinks to her knees, clutches her discarded clothes to her body, and lets out an anguished moan.
NOAH=>Hey, you’ve been out here all day. Have you eaten?
NOAH=>Do you want to?
CLAIRE=>This isn’t normal. Nothing about this is normal.
GARY=>See you later, kiddo. I had a great time.
GARY=>Sounds great.
CLAIRE=>Well it ... just started ... while you were gone.
NOAH=>See you tomorrow, Kev. Mrs. Peterson.
CLAIRE=>I don’t know ...
NOAH=>Thank you, sir.
HEADMASTER WARREN=>You said yourself when you requested the transfer --
CLAIRE=>It’s up to Kevin.
VICKY=>What’s going on? CLAIRE
VICKY=>I sure as hell hope you know what you’re doing.
GARY=>Excuse me.
GARY=>What’s that?
CLAIRE=>I think you know.
CLAIRE=>Be right there.
NOAH=>watching them through the window of the back door. His face is tight, his eyes menacing. Claire pushes Gary away. Gary turns and spots Noah. And in that instant, Noah’s sullen expression changes to a sheepish grin. Gary swings the door open.
NOAH=>Here it is.
NOAH=>Even nicer than the ones you got at school today.
NOAH=>Oh ... right. GARY
CLAIRE=>Let go of me.
CLAIRE=>What’s going on?
KEVIN=>Yeah well, sometimes you get what you deserve.
CLAIRE=>I keep asking myself what she’s doing with him.
NOAH=>Your behavior has been completely unacceptable.
ALLIE=>Yeah, me too.
KEVIN=>Well, thanks for going with me ... and driving ...
CLAIRE=>So, how’d it go? KEVIN
GARY=>Too bad. I hate for this thing to go to waste.
KEVIN=>Were you fired? GARY
GARY=>Do you think you’ll ever be able to love me again?
CLAIRE=>Gary ... oh ...
NOAH’S BEDROOM=>The lights are on, the window ajar. Noah appears, bare-chested. He unzips his jeans and wiggles out of them. Claire quickly turns away, about to close the curtains when she hears a GIRL’S LAUGHTER. Claire turns back and sees:
ALLIE=>in Noah’s room, kneeling down in front of Noah, her head moving back and forth rhythmically. She’s giving him a BLOW JOB. Claire stands there, frozen with shock -- a deer caught in the ambient light of Noah’s room. NOAH’S EYES FIX ON CLAIRE -- his face angry and spiteful. Horrified, Claire snaps the curtains shut.
KEVIN=>No we’re not.
CLAIRE=>Kevin, you’re just going to have to trust me on this.
KEVIN=>Stop the car.
ON SCREEN=>Oedipus and Jocasta embrace with joy upon hearing that the dreaded prophecy -- that Oedipus would kill his father and sleep with his mother -- was wrong.
MR. SCHMIDT=>Sandborn, you’re up.
CLAIRE=>I can’t sleep.
CLAIRE=>Sorry everybody.
THE PRINTER=>churning out an endless stream of SEX PHOTOS, each frame slightly different from the previous one -- a frame by frame chronicle of their one-night stand.
OUTER OFFICE=>Headmaster Warren enters, grabs some message slips from Loretta.
CLAIRE=>What do you mean?
HEADMASTER WARREN=>You know what our policy is regarding physical contact with students --
VICKY=>How do I look?
A ROSE-COVERED TRELLIS=>leading to a small second-story window left open a crack. She climbs up, thorns piercing her skin, rotted wood cracking with every step. At the top, she can’t quite reach the window. She crawls onto the steeply slanted roof and inches her way to the window, steadying herself with one foot in the gutter. Claire pries open the window when suddenly the gutter gives way. She grabs the windowsill as the gutter clatters to the ground. Claire hangs there, gathering strength, then hoists herself up and through the opening.
A SMALL WORKROOM=>outfitted with a computer and printer. The printer churns, calibrating itself. Claire stops it. Claire moves the computer mouse and Noah’s desktop appears. She clicks on the HARD DRIVE and scans its contents. She sees it almost immediately: A FOLDER LABELED “CLAIRE.” She opens it and finds hundreds of candid photos of herself. The early photos capture Claire performing mundane tasks: gardening, unloading groceries, taking out the trash. But gradually they become more intimate. There’s Claire reading in bed, eating dinner with Kevin, kissing Gary, and then UNDRESSING FOR NOAH AT HER BEDROOM WINDOW.
NOAH=>is standing at her window wearing a bone-chilling smile.
PRINCIPAL BRODIE=>Now if you don’t mind ...
RHONDA=>Noah’s mother hanged herself when he was eleven. CLAIRE
GARY=>Kev? You okay?
ON THE SCREEN:=>Noah and Claire fall onto his bed. He crawls on top of her, rips off her shirt, kisses her breasts. She moans. The blood drains from Gary’s face.
VICKY’S BODY=>hanging on the back of the door, the towel hook skewered through her throat, her blood dripping onto the white tile. Claire reels back, gripping the sink to keep from collapsing. She staggers out of the room.
A HORN WAILS.=>Claire careens back into her own lane with no time to spare. She finds her phone and dials.
GARY’S VOICEMAIL=>You have reached Gary Peterson ...
GARY=>What the hell?
NOAH=>A little late in the game for heroics, Gary.
KEVIN=>sees Noah’s legs so close he could reach out and touch them. He barely breathes.
NOAH=>circles the clearing, searching, as DISTANT SIRENS grow louder. His impatience builds.
KEVIN=>shakes with rage, but remains silent.
NOAH=>stomps around with growing frustration, slashing the brush with his knife.
CLAIRE=>hears Noah’s call as she runs through the woods.
KEVIN=>scrambles out from his hiding place.
WHACK!=>Claire’s shovel bashes Noah upside the head. He keels over and lies motionless in the dirt. Claire rushes to Kevin. She listens for breathing, wipes the blood from his face.
THE KNIFE=>in the dirt, out of reach but a lifeline just the same. Noah nuzzles Claire’s neck and begins to move on top of her, pressing his pelvis into her, humping her. Gradually, Claire begins to move with him. She moans with pleasure. Purrs into his ear.
THE FENCE=>splinters with each blow until finally, with the last punch, it gives way. The boys go tumbling over the side of the cliff.
IT’S NOAH.=>Claire recoils and releases his wrist. As Noah slides over the edge, he grabs Claire’s foot, dragging her with him. She snags the rope just before going over.
CLAIRE=>I can't hold on.
NOAH’S EYES=>widen with surprise as Claire yanks him over the cliff. He lets out a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM as his body bounces off the outcropping of rocks and plummets to the bottom of the ravine. Claire hangs there, gasping for breath. Then she slowly climbs up. Fighting back tears, she peers into the ravine.
EDUCATION.=>She opens it and unfolds an official looking letter. She reads: “We hereby inform you that your teaching license has been permanently revoked.” Claire smiles sadly and folds up the letter. She glances up at the garage.
