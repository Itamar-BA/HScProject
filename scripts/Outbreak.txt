NURSE=>
AMERICAN MERCENARY=>Take me home, Captain... Get me outta this shithole. Please, I wanna see my girl.
DR. RASWANI=>This will help the pain.
AMERICAN MERCENARY=>I knew... they'd come back... I knew. Help me up. Help me --
ROBBY=>Put 'em in a kennel.
GILLESPIE=>Where the hell's Yaffe?
IZZY=>What does he want?
IZZY=>Heads. No! Tails.
RAFFERTY=>T minus sixty seconds.
GILLESPIE=>Who was the index case?
IZZY=>How did he get it?
DR. IWABI=>If anyone got out, they are dead, or will be soon. And if they have spread the disease, we will know rather quickly.
FORD=>Why isn't he sick?
GILLESPIE=>Piss ass good. And you?
GILLESPIE=>Hey, she's available...
IZZY=>What are you doing?
OWI=>I don't think so.
GILLESPIE=>Ugly bastard, isn't he?
RUDY=>Whaddya mean 'she'?
RUDY=>I told you a male.
JIMBO=>What about my money?
DREW REYNOLDS=>In '91 he said Tsutsugamushi Fever was coming. In '92 it was Ebola. His panics cost us plenty. Around here he's known as Doctor Doom.
DREW REYNOLDS=>Your father was one of the greatest Surgeon Generals this country ever had. He took me under his wing and let me fly. I've always been grateful. And I've always had a special feeling for you, Robby. The... pain it gave him to see you working under Gillespie... all your promise... the man never gave you a chance to show it.
JULIO SANCHEZ=>And -- a couple of fevers of unknown origin at Boston Municipal that the infectious disease docs can't figure out. That's all we've got on the log.
BASEBALL RADIO ANNOUNCER=>Johnson's ready... Checks the runners... Salmon is waiting. Johnson delivers.
CORRINE=>Honey, what's wrong?
MOVIE PATRON=>Hey?! Watch what you're...
JULIO SANCHEZ=>Too many. The medical staff didn't know what they were dealing with so they didn't take precautions. They're scared outa their minds.
JULIO SANCHEZ=>That's just the beginning. Patient zero -- this guy Jimbo Scott -- worked in an animal quarantine facility in San Jose, California. That's probably where he picked it up. Probably the whole place is infected by now and is gonna have to be nuked.
TRACY'S FATHER=>Doc, she got sick so fast. I thought it was the flu, then she fainted in the bathroom. She's hot, Doc, so hot.
POLICE CHIEF=>I thought he was in charge.
ROBBY=>-- It's mutated --
DARLA=>They'll shoot us!!
LT. COLONEL BRIGGS=>No, ma'am. My orders are that no one is to get out of this town.
ROBBY=>Why is he so quiet?
DOCTOR MASCELLI=>And now I've got it too. I'm going to die along with the rest of them, aren't I?
IZZY=>I know. I'm fine.
LISA ARONSON=>Christ, it could have been anywhere... Maybe he was on a boat from Africa, next to the host.
SALT=>He should be dead.
SALT=>Just kidding, sir.
SALT=>To San Jose, sir?
F-15 PILOT=>Got a low target sitting on the coast. Going down for visual.
ARMISTEAD=>Just a minute, soldier.
GILLESPIE=>Find as many as you can.
REYNOLDS=>It's out of my hands!
GILLESPIE=>If we can find the host, we can obtain an effective antibody against the virus, and reproduce it. We can present them with a credible alternative...
SEAN=>Hey, that's mine!
MRS. JEFFRIES=>There are no monkeys in this forest, Sean. It's okay.
DR. FRANKLE=>Jesus Christ, Colonel, you'd have to hit the town two, three times to be sure you got everybody.
SALT=>Shake it, Colonel!
SANDMAN ONE=>General, we got a problem. It's rainin' pitchforks up heah. The damn rain will dilute it down, barely be strong enough to kill a cat.
SANDMAN ONE=>General McClintock, we are ready to commence phase one.
