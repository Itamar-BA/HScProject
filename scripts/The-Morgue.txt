DJ=>"Welcome to all our UofM students. As you all know this is the last jam until next semester. So let's get rowdy and do what we do best. P-A-R-T-Y."
DJ=>"Hold it, Hold it. Dance P' would like to take this time to congratulate the UM crusaders under their senior co-captains Titus Von-Aldershmitt and Randy Bannerman, for successfully defending their soccer championship. This one goes out to you guys. Congrats"
FIGHT=>Students and locals break out in a fight. The club security converged towards the scene. Romuald is the first person caught. The security guards wrestled him to the ground. The guard that he had bashed on the head is bleeding. He swings at Romuald. Romi is out cold. Guard#1 You wanna be all bad don't you? Well let me give you something to think about for Christmas, you bloody wanker Before he can deliver the blow, he is tackled at the waist by another student, which sends them both into the dÃ©cor. The two are evenly matched in stature and brawling styles. At the same time, Titus and Randy are in taking on another guard.
