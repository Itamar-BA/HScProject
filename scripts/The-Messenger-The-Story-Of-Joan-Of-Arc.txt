PRIEST=>Is anybody there?
PRIEST=>You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
JEANNE=>I need to confess.
PRIEST=>But you already confessed this morning...
JEANNE=>I need to confess again.
PRIEST=>So... alright. What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
JEANNE=>I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
PRIEST=>There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
JEANNE=>They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
PRIEST=>Whose were they?
JEANNE=>My father's.
PRIEST=>I'm sure he'll forgive you.
JEANNE=>He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
PRIEST=>Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
JEANNE=>Is that bad?
PRIEST=>Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
JEANNE=>Oh yes... very.
PRIEST=>And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
JEANNE=>Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
PRIEST=>Good, good. And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
JEANNE=>Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
PRIEST=>And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
JEANNE=>Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
PRIEST=>So... everything sounds... wonderful?
JEANNE=>Yes, it is.
PRIEST=>Then... why are you here so often?
JEANNE=>I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.
PRIEST=>Him?
JEANNE=>Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
PRIEST=>Who is this "he"?
JEANNE=>He never says his name.
PRIEST=>What... does he... look like?
JEANNE=>Beautiful.
PRIEST=>And what does he say to you?
JEANNE=>He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself. Do you think he's coming from the sky?
PRIEST=>Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
PRIEST=>Ego te absolvo, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.
JEANNE=>Mother...?
JEANNE=>Catherine?!
CATHERINE=>Jeanne!
CATHERINE=>Are you alright? Did they hurt you?
JEANNE=>No no, I'm fine, really...
CATHERINE=>I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you! The English are everywhere! O thank you, lord!
JEANNE=>I was in church...
CATHERINE=>Really?
JEANNE=>I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
CATHERINE=>Shhh... tell me later...
CATHERINE=>Quick -- hide in here...
JEANNE=>What about you?
CATHERINE=>Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
JEANNE=>But where are you going to be?
CATHERINE=>I'll be right here... I promise.
BLACKBEARD=>Now that's what I call booty!
BLACKBEARD=>A woman with a sword? Hey, take a look at this -- Frenchmen are such cowards that they've left all the fighting to women!
CATHERINE=>If that's God's will, then so be it!
BLACKBEARD=>Fine with me. I love women.
BLACKBEARD=>Oh... now you've hurt my feeling...
BLACKBEARD=>Hold still, bitch. How can I do it if you keep wriggling about?
BLACKBEARD=>There, that's better.
BLACKBEARD=>Your turn.
WOMAN=>Can you show some respect? We're burying our children. You should be praying instead of cursing...
WOMAN=>Yes... because only God can help us.
FATHER=>Listen, Jeanne... your Uncle and Aunt are taking you to their house for a few weeks... just to give us time to rebuild what we can.
DAXART=>Lord, we give thanks for the food you have given us. Teach us always to love this land, and to save it from those who seek to destroy it. Amen.
DAXART=>So... good night then.
AUNT=>What's going to happen to her?
DAXART=>She'll be fine. She'll grow up... find a good man... make him some children. Don't worry -- she's been hurt, but she'll survive. Tomorrow she'll be as right as rain, you'll see.
JEANNE=>I want to see a priest.
PRIEST=>I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
JEANNE=>Why did she have to die?
PRIEST=>Only God knows the answer to that.
JEANNE=>I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
PRIEST=>I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive. It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
JEANNE=>Then what will? And what will bring her back? And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me? Why didn't he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
PRIEST=>Jeanne... calm down...! Calm down, Jeanne!
PRIEST=>I don't pretend to know God's will, but I am sure of one thing -- the Lord always has a good reason. Perhaps he saved you because he needs you... for some higher calling. So... as long as you answer that call, your sister will not have died in vain.
JEANNE=>I don't want to wait for his call.
PRIEST=>Jeanne, be patient.
JEANNE=>I want to be with him always...
PRIEST=>Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
JEANNE=>I want to be at one with Him now.
DAXART=>What did he say?
AUNT=>He says we must bring her to church whenever she wants.
DAXART=>Hmmm... easy for him -- he's not the one that has to do the bringing.
JEANNE=>I want to be with you now!
JEANNE=>I'm playing.
GUARD=>The Dauphin!
CHARLES=>Louis, shouldn't you be learning your lessons?
LOUIS=>I don't want to learn, I want to fight!
CHARLES=>You will, you will. But for now, you must learn... at least to wipe your nose.
AULON=>A letter for His Majesty.
TREMOILLE=>Another one from this girl calling herself the Maiden of Lorraine.
CHARLES=>I can read for myself, you know.
TREMOILLE=>She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
CHARLES=>She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
TREMOILLE=>You mustn't see her, my lord. We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
CHARLES=>What difference does it make where she comes from?
TREMOILLE=>If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference. It might be a trap... Look... Signed "X". What sort of name is "X"? Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
REGNAULT=>My lord Tremoille is correct. She says she hears voices... she may be a sorceress... a witch...
CHARLES=>Regnault -- you see witches everywhere. She's just a peasant... a peasant who cares for her king. Look... all she wants is to help me win my crown... and permission to fight for me.
TREMOILLE=>Not exactly. She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse. Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
CHARLES=>I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
TREMOILLE=>The other half.
REGNAULT=>You mustn't see her, my lord. She may be an instrument of the devil.
YOLANDE=>Well... I think you should.
CHARLES=>Ah, Yolande... and what makes you think the exact opposite of my two most trusted advisors?
YOLANDE=>Because I care about you. Come here.
YOLANDE=>Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
CHARLES=>You think?
YOLANDE=>Mmmm. Yes. I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart. I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
CHARLES=>W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
YOLANDE=>Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
CHARLES=>You really think she's been sent... by God?
YOLANDE=>You're a fine judge of character, Charles. It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake. But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
TREMOILLE=>With respect, my lady, I think it's going to take more than just a simple peasant girl to...
YOLANDE=>I'm not interested in what you think, Tremoille -- or even what I think. It's what simple people think that matters, and the fact is that simple people up and down the country are already talking about her. Now you know what simple people are like, always ready to believe any old prophecy... like this one about a virgin from Lorraine saving France...? And now this girl comes along -- from Lorraine -- and suddenly there's a spark of hope in their simple minds. We shouldn't disappoint them. If they believe in her -- if she can put back the fire in our army -- then I believe in her too.
PAGE=>She's coming, your majesty... with an armed escort!
CHARLES=>Alright, alright -- calm yourself.
TREMOILLE=>Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman. It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
CHARLES=>My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising. Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
TREMOILLE=>Supposing she's an assassin?
CHARLES=>Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
CHARLES=>So... I suppose I'd better make a decision.
CHARLES=>Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
AULON=>That's a good idea, sire.
CHARLES=>What do you mean?
AULON=>Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
CHARLES=>... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea! If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man! Bring her up!
CHARLES=>My dear Captains, I've had a brilliant idea! We're going to have a little game. Now... let's pretend my throne is empty. Who wants to be the king?
CHARLES=>Now there's a heart-warming sight! So let's see... which one of you could possibly pass as king?
CHARLES=>Ah, Alencon, my noble duke, my royal cousin -- so fine, so brave, so rich -- so very rich -- so far-too-rich to be the King of France. Everyone knows I'm the poorest man in my kingdom.
CHARLES=>Gilles de Rais... Marshal of France... formidable to men, fascinating to women, feared by all. You'd be perfect to sit on my throne... so perfect that you might like it too much for my own piece of mind.
CHARLES=>Ah, La Hire -- my angry captain... the bravest in France -- scarred by a dozen wars, but with heart and stomach for a dozen more. You could pass for the king...
LA HIRE=>Damn bloody right I could!
CHARLES=>... until you opened your mouth. No one with a tongue like yours could pass as the King of France.
CHARLES=>Ah well... it looks as though it's going to have to be me after all... But... wait a minute...
CHARLES=>Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon? The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
AULON=>My lord, I'm not sure that...
CHARLES=>My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
AULON=>Majesty, I can't...
CHARLES=>Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
AULON=>Of course I am, it's just that...
CHARLES=>Good. Until then, feel free to live like a king!
CHARLES=>Hurry, hurry -- on the throne...
AULON=>Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
CHARLES=>So... pretend it's not a game.
JEANNE=>I have come to see the Dauphin.
JEANNE=>Who are you?
AULON=>I'm... I'm... I'm...
TREMOILLE=>... His most gracious majesty Charles de Valois, Dauphin of France...
JEANNE=>I can see you are a good man, but you're not the Dauphin. I'm sorry to insist, but we have no time to lose. I must see the Dauphin. Where is he?
TREMOILLE=>He's here. Find him yourself.
JEANNE=>There's no need to be afraid, sire.
CHARLES=>I'm... I'm not the king...
JEANNE=>I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
CHARLES=>H-h-how did you know who I am?
ALENCON=>Her voices, of course...
GILLES=>"That's him" they said, "The one with the big nose and bags under his eyes."
JEANNE=>My gentle Dauphin, I bring you good news.
JEANNE=>It is a message from the King of Heaven. For you -- and you only.
CHARLES=>Follow me.
TREMOILLE=>Your majesty, I really think you...
CHARLES=>My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
TREMOILLE=>... as always, majesty...
CHARLES=>... to ensure our privacy. I need to talk to her. Alone.
TREMOILLE=>As you wish, majesty.
TREMOILLE=>He needs to talk to her. Alone.
JEANNE=>I was about eight years old. It was a beautiful spring day. I was in the forest taking a short cut home when the wind started blowing in the trees -- such a strange sound -- almost like words -- as if someone was calling...
JEANNE=>The second time was many years later. It was autumn, and I was coming back from church when suddenly the same violent wind started to blow again...
JEANNE=>Everything was moving so fast -- the wind -- the clouds -- I couldn't move! Then suddenly a shape appeared in the middle of the sky...
JEANNE=>I was so frightened... he was so -- so here...
JEANNE=>I realized then that he had chosen me, but I didn't understand what it was I had to do...
JEANNE=>What was my mission? To help my country? But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
CHARLES=>You did well...
JEANNE=>I didn't wait long. One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
JEANNE=>Everything was suddenly made clear to me. God was finally calling me. He had a mission for me -- a message to deliver...
CHARLES=>... and what... what did he say?
JEANNE=>He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
JEANNE=>All you have to do now is put your trust in me.
CHARLES=>I trust you, Jeanne -- I do -- and I envy your certainty, but how can I be certain that I have the right to call myself king when I don't even know who my father is. My mother can't even remember... I -- I need to know...
JEANNE=>Do you really believe that God would let all this happen... if you were not the true King of France?
CHARLES=>Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon. Jean... I place her in your care. Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
AULON=>Yes, my lord.
JEANNE=>I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
CHARLES=>Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference. Take some rest.
GILLES=>She certainly cast a spell on you.
CHARLES=>She'll cast her spell on everyone if she's given half a chance... and we must ensure that she gets that chance.
CHARLES=>Can you imagine the effect it will have on the English -- to see a girl riding at the head of our army?
LA HIRE=>Yes. They'll bleeding wet themselves! Laughing.
GILLES=>We're not your favorite captains anymore??
CHARLES=>No -- I mean yes! -- of course...
ALENCON=>Charles... you want to give the command of our army to a -- woman??
CHARLES=>Of course not! You're the ones in command, as always... but if she can put back the fire in our soldiers, then maybe you, my dear Captains, will be able to raise the siege of Orleans. What do you think?
GILLES=>Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
LA HIRE=>That'll put fire in my soldiers!
CHARLES=>Please, my friends... you know me... you know how certain I am about everything, but -- maybe for the first time in my life I -- I don't know why -- but I feel I have to trust her... and now I'm asking you -- I'm begging you -- to trust me...
AULON=>Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
JEANNE=>Do you think I could have some water?
AULON=>Yes, of course... water... anything else?
JEANNE=>I would like some fresh straw.
AULON=>Louis... water and fresh straw!
JEANNE=>And I would like to see a priest.
AULON=>Now?
JEANNE=>Yes. I didn't confess today.
AULON=>Right. Raymond... a priest.
JEANNE=>I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
AULON=>Now?
JEANNE=>Better today than tomorrow.
AULON=>Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
JEANNE=>I also need someone who can read and write.
AULON=>This I can do. I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
JEANNE=>I thought you were an archer?
AULON=>Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
JEANNE=>The King of England. I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
TREMOILLE=>I can't believe you let her send such a letter...
CHARLES=>She's going to do it.
REGNAULT=>Sire, it's going to take more than a letter to drive out the English.
TREMOILLE=>An army for instance...
CHARLES=>My captains have sworn their support.
TREMOILLE=>No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier? They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money. Who's going to pay them?
YOLANDE=>I am.
CHARLES=>You will??
YOLANDE=>For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
TREMOILLE=>With respect, my lady -- the Archbishop and I have begun delicate negotiations with the Burgundians. If we can bring them over to our side...
YOLANDE=>Negotiate by all means, but from a position of strength. If the English take Orleans, there'll be nothing left to negotiate -- the rest of the country will be theirs.
TREMOILLE=>My lady, it would be the height of folly to let this... child... lead our army in the king's name without first verifying her true motives.
REGNAULT=>Tremoille is right. This girl must be subjected to a rigorous examination by the Doctors of the Church at Poitiers. We need to be absolutely certain that she is not an instrument of the devil.
CHARLES=>How can anyone be absolutely certain about anything? Our intuitions are sometimes our best counselors...
REGNAULT=>We must listen to Mother Holy Church before listening to our intuitions.
TREMOILLE=>Wait... she claims to be a virgin... Well that's something we can examine -- and be absolutely certain about.
YOLANDE=>Why not?
CHARLES=>Let's find out.
RICHMOND=>What if she's not?
YOLANDE=>I'll kill her myself...
HAG=>There is no sign of corruption or violation. She is intact.
JEANNE=>I don't remember.
JEANNE=>I saw no crown.
JEANNE=>Do you think that God can't afford to give him clothes?
JEANNE=>He gave me good advice.
JEANNE=>No.
INQUISITOR=>Are you practiced in the skills of swordsmanship?
JEANNE=>No. But I'm good with a stick.
JEANNE=>No.
JEANNE=>The road to Orleans is long, and I have good captains with me. I will learn fast, believe me.
CHIEF INQUISITOR=>We would like to believe you Jeanne, but we feel that if God were to want us to believe in you, he would have sent you with a sign as proof that we should believe in you. We cannot advise the King to entrust you with the army merely on your assertion. Can't you do something? Or show us something? Some sign to prove that you are sent by God?
JEANNE=>Sire, I did not come here to preform tricks. You are all much cleverer than I am -- me, I don't know A from B -- but this much I do know: that while the people of France lie bleeding, you sit around in your fine clothes trying to deceive me -- yet all you're doing is deceiving yourselves. You say you are men of God, yet you can't see His hand in having guided me safely through five hundred leagues of enemy country to bring you His help? Is that not proof enough? Or do you want still more signs? Give me command of an army, take me to Orleans, and there you will see the sign I was sent to make!
GAMACHE=>45-er, nor-nor-west -- straight at us!
DUNOIS=>Which side's that?
GAMACHE=>Window side...!!
XAINTRAILLES=>My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
DUNOIS=>Calm yourself, Xaintrailles. Now slowly. Who has finally done what?
XAINTRAILLES=>The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
DUNOIS=>Yes, it's a miracle.
XAINTRAILLES=>And it's not the first one! They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
DUNOIS=>Xaintrailles...! Don't talk to me about miracles... If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
XAINTRAILLES=>But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
DUNOIS=>As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
GAMACHE=>I can't believe they're sending a woman.
DUNOIS=>Maybe they never sent anyone.
GAMACHE=>I wonder what color dress she'll be wearing?
GAMACHE=>I'll wager red -- how about you?
DUNOIS=>Blue...
DUNOIS=>... with a blue ribbon in her hair to tie up Talbot!
DUNOIS=>Does anyone know if she even knows how to ride a horse?
XAINTRAILLES=>She knows...
JEANNE=>Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
DUNOIS=>Yes... they were.
JEANNE=>Good. Where are the English?
DUNOIS=>Everywhere. Where is the food?
JEANNE=>It's coming -- I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
DUNOIS=>I know...
JEANNE=>Good. Can you bring me to him?
DUNOIS=>He's on the other side of the river.
JEANNE=>So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
LA HIRE=>Hey, my friend! I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
JEANNE=>La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
LA HIRE=>Sorry Jeanne... Did you both meet already?
DUNOIS=>Well... sort of...
GILLES=>She's quite something, huh?
LA HIRE=>Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
JEANNE=>Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
DUNOIS=>Wait, wait...
JEANNE=>For what?
DUNOIS=>Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil. What makes you think they'll listen to you?
JEANNE=>Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
DUNOIS=>Well. I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
JEANNE=>You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
DUNOIS=>Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me! You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving! So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
LA HIRE=>Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
JEANNE=>They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
CROWD=>Bless us, Jeanne...! Save us!
WOMAN=>Jeanne! Bless her -- touch her!
JEANNE=>Touch her yourself... your touch is just as good as mine.
WOMAN=>But... you've been sent by God!
JEANNE=>So has everyone.
DUNOIS=>La Hire, Gilles -- let me show you something...
JEANNE=>Who do they think I am?!
AULON=>Jeanne, calm down. You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
JEANNE=>There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything. And why haven't I done anything? Because none of you will listen to me!!
DUNOIS=>Would you like to join us? We're about to discuss the campaign...
DUNOIS=>From here, Talbot has spread his forces between these forts up here, but in the last few days it seems -- according to our scouts -- that some troops have been deployed to this fort here -- which makes me think that this is where they'll be launching their attack from...
GILLES=>I would have thought they'd have attacked from here, where Talbot is.
DUNOIS=>I doubt it. From here they won't be able to utilize the river, whereas over here the current will be with them.
LA HIRE=>What about this huge pile down here?
DUNOIS=>That's the Tourelles. The English were planning to launch an attack from it, but then we broke down the bridge, which should keep them quiet for a while. My hunch is, the attack will come from St. Loup.
GILLES=>And... what does Jeanne think?
JEANNE=>I don't think. I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
DUNOIS=>So... what is the message?
JEANNE=>We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace. If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
DUNOIS=>Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all. The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
JEANNE=>God.
GILLES=>God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him! Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
LA HIRE=>Damn right!
GILLES=>Oh, but I forgot! It was a Sunday... that explains it. God's day off.
JEANNE=>You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
DUNOIS=>Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
JEANNE=>What complicated about it? All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
AULON=>Jeanne, be patient...
JEANNE=>"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with?? I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
DUNOIS=>Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
JEANNE=>Ah, so that's it. To you I'm just a girl.
DUNOIS=>Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
JEANNE=>Knowing what I know? Enormous gratitude.
LA HIRE=>One hell of a girl, huh?
JEANNE=>I warned you!
GILLES=>I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
LA HIRE=>Me too...
ALENCON=>Hello my friends! What a journey, but we made it! Back together again... let's have some fun!
ALENCON=>Did I miss something?
JEANNE=>So what if I'm a girl...? You need to look like a man to drive out the English? Fine... let's look like a man!
AULON=>Jeanne, stop it!
JEANNE=>How dare you stop me doing God's will!
AULON=>He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
JEANNE=>How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
AULON=>Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
AULON=>Raymond -- bring me scissors! Louis -- fetch that mirror!
AULON=>Jeanne, stop getting so angry about everything...! Calm down!
JEANNE=>I am calm. It's God who's angry. I need to send a letter. Now.
JEANNE=>To you, Henry King of England, and to you, Duke of Bedford who call yourself Regent of France, obey the King of Heaven and abandon your siege...
JEANNE=>... give back the keys to the other towns you have taken, and go back home to your island...
JEANNE=>To you Lord Talbot, I beg you as humbly as I can beg you, for the sake of the lives of your soldiers, do not bring about your own destruction...
JEANNE=>Surrender to me, Jeanne the Maiden, who is sent here by God, and she will make peace with you...
JEANNE=>... but if you do not heed my warning, then we shall raise such a battle-cry as there has not been heard in France for a thousand years!
JEANNE=>This is the third and last time I will write to you...
JEANNE=>If you are still here at noon, I warn you that you will hear from me to your very great destruction. Please give me your answer speedily.
REDBEARD=>Go fuck yourself!
JEANNE=>What did they say?
AULON=>Uh... they said... they will think about it.
JEANNE=>Good.
AULON=>But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
JEANNE=>I can't wait... for tomorrow...
JEANNE=>French blood is spilling!
AULON=>What's going on?!
JEANNE=>They've started the battle without me!
JEANNE=>Oh, my boys -- why didn't you wake me up?! Come on, hurry up -- Raymond, saddle my horse -- there's a battle to fight and a war to be won!
JEANNE=>My banner! I forgot my banner!
AULON=>Jeanne... here!
JEANNE=>Throw it!
GUARD=>Open the gates!
JEANNE=>What happened? Who gave the order to attack?
LA HIRE=>God knows, but it was a bad idea!
JEANNE=>Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?
GILLES=>We didn't take them... we wanted to be fast... wanted to make a surprise attack...
JEANNE=>Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack? Answer me?!
DUNOIS=>Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
JEANNE=>Sooner is better than later!
DUNOIS=>Come back... you'll be killed!
JEANNE=>Follow me and I will give you victory!
DUNOIS=>It's a great victory, Jeanne... your victory. But we must follow it through and pursue the English back to Talbot's camp... unless of course you have another good idea?
JEANNE=>We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
GILLES=>But the bridge has been pulled down!
JEANNE=>The English are rebuilding it.
DUNOIS=>How do you know?!
JEANNE=>You have been with your counsel, and I have been with mine.
REDBEARD=>Glasdale! Looks like the froggie whore's coming to pay you a visit.
JEANNE=>Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
DUNOIS=>The wind will be against us...
JEANNE=>The wind will be with us! Do as I say.
JEANNE=>Glasdale, can you hear me? You who call me a whore, I pity your soul and the souls of your men. Yield now to the King of Heaven, and go back to your island...
GLASDALE=>And you, go back to Hell!
GLASDALE=>Don't kill her till I've had my fill of her!
DUNOIS=>Let's plan this attack a little more carefully than this morning...
GILLES=>Good idea!
JEANNE=>My fine soldiers...!
JEANNE=>This morning, God gave us our first victory, but that was nothing compared to what he is ready to give us now. I know you are tired and hungry, but I swear to you in the name of the King of Heaven that even if these English were hanging from the clouds by their fingertips, we shall tear them down before nightfall...! Now, my brave soldiers... let those who love me follow me!
GILLES=>You were saying?
REDBEARD=>Hey, you just killed my woman!
AULON=>Go and find the physician... I saw him with the supplies.
GILLES=>We have to take out the arrow now.
AULON=>It's in so deep -- I'm afraid she'll bleed to death if we pull it out...
LA HIRE=>There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
GILLES=>Yes. We can pray.
LA HIRE=>Good idea...
LA HIRE=>I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life! But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
JEANNE=>Don't swear...
LA HIRE=>He heard me!
AULON=>Jeanne... we thought we'd lost you!
JEANNE=>Not so... easily. Why aren't you... fighting...? go on... we're almost there...
AULON=>Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
JEANNE=>No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
GILLES=>It's an arrow, and it's in deep...
AULON=>You must stay still till the physician arrives!
LA HIRE=>Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
JEANNE=>I'd sooner die than use magic!
AULON=>Jeanne, you will die if that arrow stays in you much longer...
JEANNE=>At least this one won't bother us any more. Now let's get back to the fight!
AULON=>Jeanne... please... you must stay calm... you must rest... please!
JEANNE=>Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
AULON=>I promise...
LA HIRE=>Oh shit! Jeanne... don't die!
AULON=>Quickly... do something!
PHYSICIAN=>She's sleeping. Like a baby.
AULON=>Jeanne's alive!
DUNOIS=>Good.
AULON=>We have to press home the attack!
DUNOIS=>Sound the retreat...
AULON=>But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
DUNOIS=>I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
AULON=>But that was her order!
DUNOIS=>I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed! Look at the mess we're in! That's her mess, not mine...! We're worse off then if she'd never come at all! ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
JEANNE=>My brave soldiers, do you believe in God?
JEANNE=>Then let God's punishment be done: Eye for eye...
JEANNE=>... tooth for tooth...! ... burn for burn...! ... life for a life!
LA HIRE=>Jeanne, come here my friend, my soldier... in my arms!
JEANNE=>Catherine??
JEANNE=>Catherine... oh, Catherine -- I knew you wouldn't leave me...!
CATHERINE=>Avenge me... avenge me...!
REDBEARD=>Hey... Frenchies... what happened to your precious angel, huh?
REDBEARD=>Frenchies, you hear me? What happened to your little virgin?
REDBEARD=>I'll tell you what happened... we sent her back to Hell so she can go fuck with the Devil!
REDBEARD=>What are you going to do, Frenchies? Why not come out and fight? Or are you too busy praying to bring your witch back from the dead? Do you hear me?
JEANNE=>I hear you! May God forgive your blasphemy... but I never can!
REDBEARD=>Go and wake up Glasdale...!
JEANNE=>Come on -- wake up -- sound trumpets and to horse!
DUNOIS=>What's going on?
JEANNE=>We're taking back the Tourelles!
GLASDALE=>What's happening?
GUARD=>My lord... the French witch just came back from the dead.
JEANNE=>Get all the men to horse and ready to follow...
DUNOIS=>Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
JEANNE=>I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
REDBEARD=>What the hell she's playing at...?
GLASDALE=>Crazy bitch... she doesn't even know how to use it...
REDBEARD=>Oh shit...
GLASDALE=>Raise the drawbridge!
REDBEARD=>Wait for me!
JEANNE=>Prepare these as battering-rams!
LA HIRE=>What's the use? The drawbridge is up!
JEANNE=>Not for long...
JEANNE=>The king said you're his finest archer...?
AULON=>Well...
JEANNE=>Come with me...
JEANNE=>You see those wooden beams...?
JEANNE=>I want you to set them on fire!
GLASDALE=>Kill her.
JEANNE=>Gilles -- fetch the Dijon Culverins and place them over there...
JEANNE=>Clear?
GILLES=>Perfectly.
ALENCON=>And me... what can I do?
JEANNE=>Um... round up the horses and keep them safe...
ALENCON=>Good idea.
SOLDIER=>Fetch some water!
JEANNE=>Stand by with the battering-rams...
DUNOIS=>We need another ten minutes...
JEANNE=>The bridge won't wait!
LA HIRE=>Leave it to me...
REDBEARD=>Hey, what happened to the whore? Sorry... virgin!
REDBEARD=>Send her over here and she won't stay a virgin for long!
DUNOIS=>Jeanne, don't do it! Just stop and think for once! Don't you see? The gate's a trap... and he's the bait!
JEANNE=>I take pity on your soul, Englishman!
REDBEARD=>What the matter? Frightened of a little English stuffing?
JEANNE=>We must both be brave...
JEANNE=>When you see my banner touch the door, the fortress is ours!
REDBEARD=>... and... fire!!
GLASDALE=>This time she won't be back.
JEANNE=>The place is ours!
GLASDALE=>To arms! To arms!
GLASDALE=>Soldiers... In the name of the king, I want you to kill these French dogs until there's none left!
MAN=>Jeanne... what are you doing?
JEANNE=>Playing...
MAN=>Jeanne... what are you doing?
MAN=>What have you done to me, Jeanne?
MAN=>What have you done to me?
JEANNE=>I -- I -- I...
AULON=>Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
JEANNE=>Yes...
AULON=>It's over, Jeanne. We won, just as you said!
LA HIRE=>Jeanne, come here my friend, my soldier... in my arms!
JEANNE=>We... won?!
LA HIRE=>Won?! Such a small word will never do! This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
LA HIRE=>Jeanne -- what's the matter??
JEANNE=>You call this... glory...? All this... this blood... this smell of...
LA HIRE=>... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm! I love it!
JEANNE=>It's not possible...
GILLES=>You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
JEANNE=>No... not like this...
GILLES=>For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
JEANNE=>Stop it! What are you doing?
SOLDIER=>Nothing... just taking his teeth.
JEANNE=>But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
SOLDIER=>Why not? He has good teeth...
JEANNE=>Because... because you just can't!
GILLES=>Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth...
SOLDIER=>Besides, what about these...?
JEANNE=>That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
SOLDIER=>Not me. He's my prisoner... I can take his teeth if I want to...
JEANNE=>No!
JEANNE=>Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
LA HIRE=>Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
JEANNE=>If you kill him, you kill me!
GILLES=>Jeanne... let him do it. One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
JEANNE=>I care! And I care because God cares! All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
LA HIRE=>Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward. Let him take a few teeth...
JEANNE=>A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
SOLDIER=>Yeah...
JEANNE=>Here -- take this instead.
JEANNE=>He's mine now.
JEANNE=>Now you... get out.
GILLES=>Bravo! What about all the other hundreds of prisoners? Do we let them go too?
JEANNE=>Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
JEANNE=>Please... we have to be confessed... all of us... now! I know it's not normal custom, but sometimes... you know... we have to make an exception and... and today is an exception...
JEANNE=>He's going to confess us. Kneel!
LA HIRE=>Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
JEANNE=>I said, kneel!
JEANNE=>Please... we're ready... begin!
SOLDIER=>The English... they're forming up... thousands of them... on the far side of the river...
DUNOIS=>Well...? Shall we go?
JEANNE=>Not yet.
DUNOIS=>The English won't wait.
JEANNE=>I'll go.
AULON=>Jeanne, no...
JEANNE=>Alone.
JEANNE=>I have a message for your King Henry. It is a message from God.
JEANNE=>Go home... Go now, in peace. If you don't go now, you will be buried in this field. I've seen enough blood for today, but if you want more, I can't stop you. I can only warn you that it will be your blood, not ours.
JEANNE=>I'm waiting for your answer.
JEANNE=>Please, Lord... don't... don't let this happen... don't leave me...
DUNOIS=>Never wait for miracles. Stand by to attack...
LA HIRE=>By God and all the saints... now that's what I call a bloody miracle!
BEDFORD=>I want that girl. I want her burned.
CHARLES=>It's too tight -- where's the seamstress? And that... ... that's meant to be a crown? Don't you have something more -- more regal?
PRIEST=>The English took the real one...
CHARLES=>I asked for a grandiose coronation, and this is what you give me? This whole thing's going to be a complete fiasco...!
BISHOP=>Sire, we were only given three days to prepare -- three days! -- Why, your father's coronation took three months!
CHARLES=>He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
TREMOILLE=>There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
CHARLES=>Let them come! Let them see who's the true king of France!
DUNOIS=>It's been muddy for so long, I forgot how good it looked when cleaned up...
LA HIRE=>Did you remember to clean up what's inside as well?
CHARLES=>Those damn English... we should be doing this in Paris... in Notre Dame -- much more prestigious -- and twice as big as this one!
YOLANDE=>It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size. Am I correct, Bishop?
BISHOP=>Oh yes, my lady. All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
TREMOILLE=>Yes, yes -- well let's just get on with it, shall we?
GILLES=>... before the English turn up and spoil everything.
CHARLES=>They wouldn't dare!
GILLES=>I wouldn't be so sure. It only takes one of them -- in disguise --
GILLES=>... with a good dagger... that's all it takes...
GILLES=>... to ruin the whole thing.
CHARLES=>Hurry up!
CANON=>Your Grace, there can be no anointing!
BISHOP=>What in heaven's name are you talking about?
CANON=>The holy oil of Clovis -- it's all gone!
BISHOP=>Gone?? But that's impossible -- it's magic oil... I mean miraculous oil -- it can never be exhausted...
CANON=>Look for yourself!
YOLANDE=>Problem?
BISHOP=>I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
YOLANDE=>And when was that?
BISHOP=>Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
YOLANDE=>Thirty years ago? I'm not surprised it's gone...
BISHOP=>No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
BISHOP=>W-w-what are you doing?!
YOLANDE=>Performing a miracle.
CHARLES=>Ah, Jeanne... come here...! This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
JEANNE=>... You look wonderful...
CHARLES=>... and my crown doesn't fit and... Really??
JEANNE=>You look like a king.
REGNAULT=>With this sacred oil, blessed by the hand of God the Father Almighty, we do anoint thee Charles Valois...
REGNAULT=>... we do anoint thee Charles Valois, Sovereign Lord and King of this great kingdom of France, charging that ye defend the faith of our Mother Holy Church so long as ye shall live...
AULON=>Jeanne...! Are you alright?
JEANNE=>Yes. Yes, I'm fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
AULON=>Because there's an arrow in your leg.
JEANNE=>So there is...
JEANNE=>... but that's no reason for you to stop. You can still climb a ladder, can't you? So go on then... climb!
JEANNE=>Raymond! Over here!
JEANNE=>Pull it out.
JEANNE=>Pull it out!
GILLES=>This is no good!
LA HIRE=>No good? This is a disaster!
GILLES=>Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
JEANNE=>I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
GILLES=>Jeanne... we're not enough...
JEANNE=>So... bring up the reinforcements!
GILLES=>Reinforcements? Where??
JEANNE=>Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
GILLES=>Jeanne, look behind you.
JEANNE=>Never look behind -- only ahead!
GILLES=>Do you know how to count?
JEANNE=>Of course I do? Bring them up!
GILLES=>Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
JEANNE=>But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
GILLES=>He never sent them... Don't you understand? He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
JEANNE=>But my voices... they promised me...
GILLES=>To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts! We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you. You should go home, Jeanne.
JEANNE=>You don't believe me anymore?
LA HIRE=>We still believe in you, Jeanne. If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
CHARLES=>Well, this is an unexpected pleasure. Ladies, let me introduce you to the celebrated Jeanne...
JEANNE=>Get them out of here!
CHARLES=>Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
JEANNE=>Why did you betray me? Paris was ours for the taking! All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
CHARLES=>Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
JEANNE=>So how would you put it?
CHARLES=>Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done. Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English. You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season: a time for war, and a time for peace"...
JEANNE=>Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
CHARLES=>Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty? Do you enjoy it? All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
JEANNE=>I have letters here from towns under siege -- Compiegne, Provins, Melin -- where the people are starving, begging God on their knees to help them... and I'm here to answer their prayers -- and you want to stop me? France does not belong to you, Charles -- she belongs to God. And if you won't help me save her, I shall do it alone!
CHARLES=>If only she would just go home.
RAYMOND=>You can't go in.
AULON=>Get out...!
AULON=>Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
JEANNE=>So... what am I supposed to do now?
AULON=>What do your voices say?
JEANNE=>They've abandoned me... like everyone.
AULON=>What... what do you mean?
JEANNE=>It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
AULON=>Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
JEANNE=>It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
AULON=>But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
JEANNE=>Well of course they're me! That's how God talks to me. If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
AULON=>But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
JEANNE=>All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
AULON=>But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
JEANNE=>I don't know it. I feel it.
AULON=>You make it sound so simple...
JEANNE=>The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
AULON=>Me?! It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated! If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place? And why let this war go on for a hundred years? And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family? Why, why?!
JEANNE=>So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
AULON=>Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
AULON=>I... I just wish I could... I want to... to help you...
JEANNE=>If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
AULON=>Tell me...
JEANNE=>Tell the king to give me more men.
TREMOILLE=>We have to stop her, your majesty. If she raises her own army and attacks the Burgundians at Compiegne, all my months of painful negotiations will have been in vain!
REGNAULT=>Tremoille is right. She behaves as though she were God! It's high time she found out who's really in command.
CHARLES=>It's true. There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
YOLANDE=>I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war. For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
CHARLES=>I... I can't stop her.
TREMOILLE=>Well if you don't, I'm sure the Burgundians will be happy to oblige. If they capture her at Compiegne...
REGNAULT=>... no one can blame us.
CHARLES=>I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
TREMOILLE=>Noooo!
REGNAULT=>Good heavens no!
TREMOILLE=>Never!
YOLANDE=>Don't worry, Charles. If God is still with her, she will be victorious. We're not her judges... we're just spectators. Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
CHARLES=>But... her army's so small now...
YOLANDE=>Then her faith will have to be bigger.
AULON=>Jeanne... I need to speak to you. Alone.
JEANNE=>Did the king listen to you?
AULON=>Jeanne, I... I love you, Jeanne. I love you and... I want to marry you.
JEANNE=>That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
AULON=>You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
JEANNE=>What did the king say?
AULON=>He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
JEANNE=>It's a trap! They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
AULON=>Did your voices tell you that? You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
JEANNE=>No, but...
AULON=>Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
JEANNE=>Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
AULON=>To marry you.
JEANNE=>I will ask my voices... if they come back one day. Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
AULON=>Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
AULON=>Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
JEANNE=>I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
AULON=>But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
JEANNE=>But it is what I want.
AULON=>To be killed in battle?
JEANNE=>If God wants me to win, he will find a way. And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too. Then I'll be with him forever.
AULON=>Will you at least let me stay with you?
JEANNE=>It would not be the same without you.
AULON=>We must sound the retreat!
JEANNE=>Not yet!
MAYOR=>I can't risk the town's safety. Raise the drawbridge.
JEANNE=>Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
AULON=>But... why... what's the point?
JEANNE=>Do as I say!
AULON=>I want to stay with you...
JEANNE=>That's an order!
JEANNE=>My Lord...
JEANNE=>Take me...!
MAN=>I can't believe it... your romantic vision of death, with all that grass growing everywhere... I must admit, you have a great imagination. Or maybe not great enough. Death is much more simple...
MAN=>... after a few months it gets more interesting...
MAN=>... then -- after a year -- it finally becomes romantic...
JEANNE=>Who... who are you...?
MAN=>I am that I am. You don't like my face? Maybe you prefer this one...
MAN=>Too young maybe? How about this one?
MAN=>Better, no...? But incomplete.
JEANNE=>Get thee behind me. Satan!
MAN=>Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil? Are you God?
JEANNE=>No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
MAN=>HOW CAN YOU BEGIN TO IMAGINE THAT GOD, THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH, THE SOURCE OF ALL LIFE, COULD POSSIBLY NEED -- YOU?
JEANNE=>I don't know... I thought...
MAN=>YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
JEANNE=>I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
MAN=>WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
JEANNE=>I... don't know... what do you want from me?
MAN=>Nothing. I'm here to set you free...
GUARD=>I said, smile! You have visitors.
GUARD=>His Grace the Duke of Burgundy.
BURGUNDY=>So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English? You look pretty ordinary to me...
JEANNE=>Am I... am I dead?
BURGUNDY=>Dead you're worthless, darling.
JEANNE=>Where... where am I?
BURGUNDY=>Guess.
JEANNE=>My king will pay any ransom you ask.
BURGUNDY=>Your king? Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows? Chickens? I prefer gold, and the English have plenty. I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
JEANNE=>God defeated the English, not me.
BURGUNDY=>And God who allowed you to be caught?
BURGUNDY=>Personally I don't believe in God, and I don't believe in the Devil either. That's why I'm never disappointed. Sell her.
AULON=>Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
CHARLES=>Very generous of you all. How much?
AULON=>10,000 gold crowns.
CHARLES=>10,000... that's a lot... but I fear not enough. But it will be my pleasure to make up the difference. Your Grace... I place you in charge of this... sensitive negotiation.
DIJON=>They send a Bishop to negotiate? That's a good sign. Let him in.
CAUCHON=>Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
DIJON=>He's feeling wonderful.
CAUCHON=>Thanks be to God.
DIJON=>And your Duke? The Duke of Bedford?
CAUCHON=>Not so well, I regret to say. This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment. That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
DIJON=>Buying her?
CAUCHON=>This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation. In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims. You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
DIJON=>I understand. How much?
REGNAULT=>5,000 gold crowns.
DIJON=>That's not a lot.
REGNAULT=>It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings. His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
DIJON=>I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
REGNAULT=>May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
DIJON=>20,000 gold crowns.
CAUCHON=>20,000?! But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
DIJON=>Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings. What is your last offer?
REGNAULT=>8,000. We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
DIJON=>I must offer to the Duke. I will give you his answer tomorrow.
SOLDIER=>Hey, wake up... get yourself ready... you're leaving!
JEANNE=>Oh, thank you Lord! I'm so glad to see you! I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
CAUCHON=>I will hear you... but not now, not here.
JEANNE=>Who are you?
CAUCHON=>Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
JEANNE=>Trial? What trial??
CAUCHON=>Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.
JEANNE=>But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
CAUCHON=>It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
JEANNE=>The English??
CAUCHON=>Yes. They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
VOICE=>Need some help?
JEANNE=>What are you doing out here?
MAN=>I might ask you the same question.
JEANNE=>I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
MAN=>And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
JEANNE=>Everything! Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
MAN=>You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry? Why not face up to your lies? It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
JEANNE=>I... I never lied!
MAN=>If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
JEANNE=>I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven. He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
MAN=>How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here? "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
JEANNE=>You're right... I shouldn't do that.
MAN=>That's too easy. One minute you want to die, the next you want to live... Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
JEANNE=>No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
MAN=>Oh? And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
JEANNE=>I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
MAN=>Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace? You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
JEANNE=>I don't understand. What do you want from me?
MAN=>I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
GUARD=>The king is occupied...!
AULON=>Out of my way!
CHARLES=>My dear Aulon... That's fine...
AULON=>Jeanne's been badly injured! She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
CHARLES=>It's a miracle she's not dead!
AULON=>We have to do something before she tries it again! I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
CHARLES=>Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
AULON=>But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
CHARLES=>Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God? Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught. Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no. And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no. Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
AULON=>No. I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
REGNAULT=>How can you speak such treachery when his majesty has done everything to try and save her?
AULON=>Because I was at this door when you planned to betray her... and I was at Compiegne when she was betrayed.
TREMOILLE=>Guards! Arrest this traitor!
AULON=>What do you fear most now... my sword? ... or his hands?
CHARLES=>Tremoille... don't. Please...
AULON=>My sword is long enough for both of you.
AULON=>I have always been loyal and true to you, but my allegiance is now at an end. From now on, my loyalty belongs to Jeanne...
GUARD=>... so don't say I didn't warn you! Don't touch her whatever you do -- don't even stretch out your hand or she'll have one of your fingers off sooner than spit at you!
GUARD=>Savage? She's a monster! At Orleans they say she drank her victim's blood!
MALE=>Don't worry, my sweet -- I'll have my sword at the ready...
DUCHESS=>Don't you think this visit is a little... inappropriate?
BEDFORD=>My dear, it's our duty... she's our guest!
BEDFORD=>Wake her up so we can see her face!
GUARD=>Hey, wake up... we got noble guests -- don't disappoint them -- turn round!
GUARD=>Now she's sleepy but you wait and see -- any moment now and she'll start speaking to her devils, and then she'll get to yelping like a wolf in heat! The other night she made her cage spin round so fast we thought she was going to fly away!
WOMAN=>Oooo... she gives me creeps...
GUARD=>Do you want her to stand up so you can get a better look?
DUCHESS=>No. But get her out of this cage and give her a decent bed.
DUCHESS=>I'm sorry, but this child is being treated like an animal! Don't you think that whatever her crimes may be, she deserves a little more of our charity?
BEDFORD=>She's not a child, my dear -- she's a witch.
CAUCHON=>Let the prisoner be brought in.
CAUCHON=>Our most serene and Christian King Henry the Sixth, King of England and France, has handed this girl over to us, accused of a number of heretical deeds, to be tried in a matter of faith.
CAUCHON=>Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
JEANNE=>I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about. You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
CAUCHON=>You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
JEANNE=>I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
CAUCHON=>You must take the oath! Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
JEANNE=>I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
CAUCHON=>So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
JEANNE=>My name is Jeanne. My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me. I would like to have it back.
CAUCHON=>Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born?
JEANNE=>In a village called Domremy.
CAUCHON=>How old are you?
CAUCHON=>Nineteen... or thereabouts...
CAUCHON=>Were you baptized?
JEANNE=>Yes. In the church at Domremy.
CAUCHON=>Recite the Lord's Prayer.
JEANNE=>Not unless you hear my confession.
CAUCHON=>Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own. We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her. But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority. Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you. So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
JEANNE=>Not unless you hear my confession.
CAUCHON=>Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
JEANNE=>And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
CAUCHON=>Guards! Take the prisoner away! Clear the room!
BEDFORD=>I count on you to have it done.
BUCK=>Uh... to have what done?
BEDFORD=>I want her burned.
BUCK=>As you say, sir.
CAUCHON=>Well... in the future I think we should conduct our enquiries in private -- away from public pressure -- so we can all be more... level- headed...
CAUCHON=>Because it's... it's our clear duty to root out heresy wherever it occurs. Father Vincente... you are the most venerable among us, what do you think?
OLD PRIEST=>I think this trial is a masquerade, and I won't be part of it anymore. I am willing to be her judge, but not her executioner. This young girl seems courageous and pious... she deserves to be well judged.
CAUCHON=>That's what I'm trying to ensure!
OLD PRIEST=>The verdict comes at the end of a trial, Cauchon, not at the beginning. I am going back to Rome, to give me report to our Holy Father the Pope.
CAUCHON=>This is ridiculous! Now I'm the one who's on trial and being judged?!
OLD PRIEST=>Yes... exactly as Jeanne predicted.
BUCK=>Arrest them!
CAUCHON=>What are you doing? This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
BUCK=>Rouen is in English territory. I have the right to do anything I like. Take them away.
JEANNE=>Our father who is in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come in earth as it is in heaven forgive them that lead... forgive us that lead them... as we forgive them that... oh God, don't cut yourself off from me like this... I don't know what I'm meant to say or not say anymore... I don't even know what to think... oh, God, I'm so lost... don't abandon me like everyone else... please, I beg of you... at least say you can hear me...! Tell me you hear me...! Why won't you answer me? Please, I beg of you -- ANSWER ME!
MAN=>Why were you yelling like that?!
JEANNE=>What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
MAN=>Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
JEANNE=>Yes!
MAN=>Who?
JEANNE=>My... visions...
MAN=>They're going to come and visit you in here?
JEANNE=>Yes... that's what I pray for...!
MAN=>I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay... on the side? I won't bother you.
JEANNE=>No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
MAN=>Why not?
JEANNE=>Because... I have to be alone!
MAN=>They won't come anyway.
JEANNE=>What do you mean, they won't come?
MAN=>Why would they?
JEANNE=>Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
MAN=>God asked you to do something?
JEANNE=>Yes... lots of things!
MAN=>You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
JEANNE=>No, but... he sent me so many signs!
MAN=>What signs?
JEANNE=>Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
MAN=>No. That was a sword in a field.
JEANNE=>But... it didn't just get there by itself.
MAN=>True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another? There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
MAN=>Seems a perfectly valid explanation... but how about this one...
OLD MAN=>Hey, you little devils -- come back!
MAN=>But then again, there are other possibilities...
MAN=>... or even faster...
MAN=>... and that's without counting the inexplicable...
MAN=>Yet from an infinite number of possibilities, you had to pick this one...
MAN=>You didn't see what was, Jeanne. You saw what you wanted to see.
BEAUPERE=>This... "voice" that you say appears to you... is it an angel? Or a saint? Or does it come from God?
JEANNE=>I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
BEAUPERE=>You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
JEANNE=>No...
BEAUPERE=>Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
JEANNE=>No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
D'ESTIVET=>When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
JEANNE=>If there was, I didn't see it...
D'ESTIVET=>Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
JEANNE=>Go and ask him yourself.
CAUCHON=>Jeanne, you are not helping yourself. If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
JEANNE=>These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
CAUCHON=>I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
JEANNE=>Not long ago...
CAUCHON=>When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
JEANNE=>Last night.
CAUCHON=>What were you doing when the voice came?
JEANNE=>Praying.
CAUCHON=>The voice was in your cell?
JEANNE=>Yes.
CAUCHON=>What did it tell you?
JEANNE=>Many things...
CAUCHON=>Did it give you advice? Good advice?
JEANNE=>Go onto the next question.
BEAUPERE=>Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
JEANNE=>I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
JEAN MIDI=>Do you consider yourself to be in a state of grace?
JEANNE=>Go on to the next question.
CAUCHON=>Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
JEANNE=>Yes...
CAUCHON=>Is it here? Now? In this room?
JEANNE=>No.
BUCK=>Who's running this trial, you or her? I can't believe it! This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
CAUCHON=>She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
BUCK=>There is only one king of France and that's our liege Lord Henry the Sixth! It is written in black and white in the Treaty of Troyes -- that you French bastards signed!
CAUCHON=>I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
BUCK=>To hell with procedure! We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
CAUCHON=>But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
BUCK=>We want her burned as a witch!
CAUCHON=>But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
BUCK=>Well then? Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
D'ESTIVET=>You told us about the appearance of this... voice. What exactly did you see? Part of it... or all of it?
JEANNE=>His face.
D'ESTIVET=>Does he have hair?
JEANNE=>Yes.
D'ESTIVET=>Is it long and hanging down?
JEANNE=>I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
D'ESTIVET=>But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him? By what he said?
JEANNE=>Go on to the next question.
D'ESTIVET=>That's enough! You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
JEANNE=>If you were to tear me limb from limb and make my soul leave my body, I would tell you nothing more. And if I did say anything, then afterward I would simply say that you dragged it out of me by force. Now... please... go onto the next question.
JEAN LE MAISTRE=>Who told you to wear men's clothes?
JEANNE=>The clothes are not important...
JEAN LE MAISTRE=>You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man! It proves your desire to deceive...
JEANNE=>It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
JEAN LE MAISTRE=>So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
JEANNE=>I... submit to Our Lord.
JEAN LE MAISTRE=>But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
JEANNE=>It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same. Why must you complicate what is so simple?
CAUCHON=>Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne. On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved. And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians. Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error. That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
JEANNE=>So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
CAUCHON=>It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
JEANNE=>I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
MAITRE MAURICE=>When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
JEANNE=>Yes... a half-steed... white.
MAITRE MAURICE=>Who gave you that horse?
JEANNE=>My king.
MAITRE MAURICE=>How many did he give you?
JEANNE=>Five steeds and a few hackneys...
MAITRE MAURICE=>As much as for a Lord? What an honor! Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
JEANNE=>No.
MAITRE MAURICE=>What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
JEANNE=>Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
MAITRE MAURICE=>Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
JEANNE=>And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
BEAUPERE=>Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
JEANNE=>I tried to.
BEAUPERE=>It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
JEANNE=>I don't remember. Maybe.
BEAUPERE=>Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
JEANNE=>I don't know...
BEAUPERE=>And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
JEANNE=>No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
BEAUPERE=>That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
JEANNE=>I can't read.
BEAUPERE=>Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission! Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
JEANNE=>I leave the answer to God.
JEAN MIDI=>Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
JEANNE=>I had been sold to the English. I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
JEAN MIDI=>Did your voice tell you to jump?
JEANNE=>No...
JEAN MIDI=>So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
JEANNE=>No...!
JEAN MIDI=>How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
JEANNE=>That's now what I meant...
JEAN MIDI=>Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin? No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
JEANNE=>I know, but that's not the way things happened...
JEAN MIDI=>You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
JEANNE=>Yes, but...
JEAN MIDI=>And you didn't jump of your free will?
JEANNE=>No!
JEAN MIDI=>Oh? Perhaps someone pushed you then?
BEAUPERE=>Do you have a sword?
JEANNE=>Quite a few.
BEAUPERE=>Didn't you also carry a banner?
JEANNE=>Yes...
BEAUPERE=>Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
JEANNE=>I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
BEAUPERE=>And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
JEANNE=>No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
BEAUPERE=>And?
JEANNE=>And so I... I prefer my banner.
BEAUPERE=>Why?
JEANNE=>To avoid killing anyone.
BEAUPERE=>Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
JEANNE=>No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
BEAUPERE=>Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
JEANNE=>No! I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
BEAUPERE=>We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
JEANNE=>Yes, probably... maybe...
BEAUPERE=>So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
JEANNE=>Yes, but...
BEAUPERE=>Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
JEANNE=>No, I... I held it up to...
BEAUPERE=>You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
JEANNE=>Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
BEAUPERE=>... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
JEANNE=>No, I... I never killed anyone!
MAN=>I can't believe you can lie like that!
JEANNE=>I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
MAN=>Oh? You can't remember? Let me help your memory...
JEANNE=>No! I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone! I didn't kill that man!
MAN=>Oh no? How about this one?
MAN=>Or this one?
JEANNE=>Stop, stop... I can't remember! The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
MAN=>So your memory's coming back?
JEANNE=>Yes... yes! And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery? Why didn't he?
MAN=>Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
JEANNE=>No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
MAN=>In His name??
JEANNE=>Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
MAN=>Really?
JEANNE=>Let all who love me follow me!
MAN=>"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned? Come on Jeanne, be honest. You fought for yourself, in your name.
JEANNE=>I... I was defending myself as best I could! Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they? Or should I have let myself be killed?
MAN=>No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
JEANNE=>No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
MAN=>I agree...
JEANNE=>Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
MAN=>I don't agree. Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
JEANNE=>Why are you doing this to me?? Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
MAN=>Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define. When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
JEANNE=>I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
MAN=>Really?
JEANNE=>Nnnnooooooooo!
JEANNE=>Help me... please... set me free!
MAN=>You will be, Jeanne. You will be.
AULON=>I'm replacing Father Demaury. He's become very sick...
GUARD=>It's amazing how many people have become suddenly very sick since the beginning of this trial... it must be this witch casting spells on them. Burn her!
AULON=>I'll do my best.
BEAUPERE=>Wake her up.
JEAN MIDI=>So... let us summarize your situation. You refuse to submit to the authority of the church militant by taking an oath; you made an assault on Paris on a Sunday; you hurled yourself down from the tower at Beaurevoir, and you persist in wearing male dress... I ask you again: do you believe that you are in a state of grace?
JEANNE=>If I am not, may God bring me there. If I am, may He keep me there.
CAUCHON=>Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
BUCK=>How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?! I've had enough!
CAUCHON=>Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
BUCK=>So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight! Don't you understand? They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
CAUCHON=>It is not for us to burn her, my lord. That is your prerogative.
BUCK=>... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
CAUCHON=>But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
BUCK=>Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys: go and torture the bitch!
CAUCHON=>You won't be able to drag anything from her that way. You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
BUCK=>Scared of a girl?
CAUCHON=>Scared to make a mistake. Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
BUCK=>Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
CAUCHON=>I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
BUCK=>Well find some other way! Be creative. Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that? Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
CAUCHON=>One small problem, my lord. The girl is a virgin.
BUCK=>That is a very small problem.
MAN=>What are you doing?
JEANNE=>I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
MAN=>What are you doing on the wall?
JEANNE=>I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
MAN=>What for?
JEANNE=>Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
MAN=>Do you think this cross will protect you?
JEANNE=>No, I...
MAN=>Look at them... with their beautiful cross...
MAN=>... The sight of priests blessing entire armies before they go off to kill each other never ceases to amaze me. And that these massacres should be recorded as acts of faith in God's name... And they think that making a beautiful cross or building a cathedral will wash away their sins... ridiculous! Just like that priest who accused you of fighting on a Sunday. Did God give permission to kill each other for the rest of the week?
JEANNE=>"Love your enemies"...
MAN=>Good. But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
JEANNE=>My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
MAN=>I don't think so.
JEANNE=>Are you going to leave me too?
MAN=>Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
JEANNE=>Are you sent by God?
WOMAN=>But you've been sent by God!
JEANNE=>So has everyone...
MAN=>So has everyone...
JEANNE=>There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
MAN=>Do you think you are ready?
JEANNE=>Yes I am.
MAN=>Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
JEANNE=>Yes...
MAN=>... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
JEANNE=>Yes. I'm ready now.
MAN=>Let's see.
BLACKBEARD=>Now that's what I call booty!
JEANNE=>Oh no...
BLACKBEARD=>We thought you must be pretty bored in here, so we've come to liven you up a bit... right, lads?
JEANNE=>Please -- don't do it -- don't hurt me --
BLACKBEARD=>Of course not, sweetheart... if you promise to do as I say...
JEANNE=>Where are you? Don't leave me... please...
BLACKBEARD=>Hey, come on... open up...!
BLACKBEARD=>Stop screaming like that! You'll wake up the whole bleedin' castle!
BLACKBEARD=>Ah, so you want to play it rough? Good... I like it better that way!
DUCHESS=>Stop that at once! That's an order!
DUCHESS=>I command you to stop, in the name of the King!
DUCHESS=>Leave her alone, do you hear? Come on, get out!
BLACKBEARD=>We were just having a little fun, that's all, keeping her company.
DUCHESS=>Men like you are the cause of our country's dishonor!
BLACKBEARD=>We were serving our country... just obeying orders, ma'am...
DUCHESS=>Go on, get out of here!
BLACKBEARD=>See you later, angel.
JEANNE=>Thank you...
DUCHESS=>This won't happen again, I give you my word.
BEDFORD=>And... What a pleasant surprise...
DUCHESS=>You should know that each humiliation you inflict on this woman, you inflict on all women, including yours my lord.
BEDFORD=>Wha... what on earth are you talking about?
DUCHESS=>If you send anymore of your soldiers to Jeanne's cell... I will kill them myself.
BEDFORD=>I'm giving you one more day.
CAUCHON=>Jeanne, my very dear friend in Christ, we, your judges and assessors, desirous of reaching a true and lawful verdict, submitted a transcript of your trial to the University of Paris in order to obtain their opinion. After careful consideration, the learned scholars have concluded with us that you have committed many grievous sins, and I ask you to listen most carefully to their opinion as contained in these articles.
MAURICE=>Article One. You have said that from an early age you have had revelations from the blessed saints and angels, that you have seen them with your own eyes, and that they speak to you. As to this article, the learned scholars have declared that these claims are untrue, pernicious and evil, and that all such revelations are superstitious, and proceed from the devil.
MAURICE=>Article Two. You said that by God's command you have continually worn men's clothes, and that you have also worn your hair short, without nothing...
JEANNE=>My lord... don't abandon me... where are you? Is this what you want? You want me to burn? To burn without being confessed...? I'll do anything you want... but don't leave me...
JEANNE=>Don't leave me here... please... don't leave me alone!
MAURICE=>Finally, Article Twelve. You have said that you are not willing to submit yourself to the judgment of the Church Militant, but only to God. As to this Article, the scholars say that you have no comprehension of the authority of the Church, that you have perniciously erred in the faith of God, and that you are a child of superstition, a wanderer from the Faith, an invoker of demons, a sorceress, an idolater and a heretic!
CHATILLON=>Jeanne, we once again admonish, beg and exhort you to cast out and recant your erroneous beliefs, and return into the way of truth by submitting yourself to the authority of our Mother Holy Church by signing this recantation.
JEANNE=>If the church wants me to say that my visions are evil, then I don't believe in this church and I submit myself to the judgment of God!
BEDFORD=>Perform your office!
CAUCHON=>Wait!
CAUCHON=>Jeanne, I beg of you... sign! In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you! If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death! Is that what you want??
JEANNE=>No... I want to be confessed.
CAUCHON=>Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
JEANNE=>And may I go to Mass?
CAUCHON=>As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
CAUCHON=>Sign, and you'll be free from your chains... free from the fire, Jeanne... now... sign!
AULON=>Sign, Jeanne -- sign!
MAN=>You know what you just signed, Jeanne? You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion. You see? In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
JEANNE=>No...
JEANNE=>Please... may I have it back...
CAUCHON=>You have nothing to regret...
JEANNE=>I didn't mean it! I didn't know what I was signing! You tricked me...!
CAUCHON=>Silence her! Take her away...!
CAUCHON=>There... she has recanted, and we accept her repentance, for the church never closes her arms to those who return to the fold. She's yours to do whatever you want with her, but the church has nothing to do with it anymore. She's your prisoner -- your martyr -- not ours.
BUCK=>Here... in case you want to get dressed -- try these for size!
JEANNE=>He promised I'd be confessed... and go to Mass... and be free from these chains...!
BUCK=>We never promised you anything! But this much I can promise you... that you won't be leaving this dungeon till the day you die!
MONK=>My lord Bishop... come quickly...!
BEDFORD=>Ah, Cauchon... come to see for yourself? Well, take a look.
BEDFORD=>You see? Dressed as a man again! Her touching repentance didn't last very long, did it. The Bishop of Senlis was passing by and was on hand to witness her very evident relapse.
CAUCHON=>And by what miracle did these clothes find their way in here?
BEDFORD=>Not a miracle, my dear Cauchon... an evil spell! This girl is a witch, and tomorrow she will burn for it! Have the stake prepared in the market place...!
CAUCHON=>I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it? Why?
JEANNE=>And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
CAUCHON=>I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
JEANNE=>It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
JEANNE=>I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
CAUCHON=>I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
MAN=>Do you really want to confess, Jeanne? I'm listening.
JEANNE=>I have committed sins, my Lord -- so many sins. As a child, the only way I could help my people was to pray. So I prayed to God and his saints. I prayed more and more, and gave God all my love... but isn't it said that God helps them who help themselves? So I helped myself... and I saw signs... the ones I wanted to see -- and I fought, out of revenge and despair. Yes, I was proud -- stubborn -- selfish -- and cruel... I was all the things that humans believe they are allowed to be when they're fighting for a cause.
MAN=>You think you are ready now?
JEANNE=>Yes, my lord.
MAN=>Let's see.
AULON=>Jeanne... thank God!
AULON=>We must hurry -- I took care of the guard, but others are coming...!
JEANNE=>I am ready now...
AULON=>Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
JEANNE=>I'm already free...
AULON=>Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
JEANNE=>My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
AULON=>I -- I don't understand...
JEANNE=>One day you will.
AULON=>You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
AULON=>... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even... ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
JEANNE=>I'm staying, Jean.
AULON=>No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
JEANNE=>I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
AULON=>Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
JEANNE=>I am at peace now, my gentle friend... at peace with myself.
JEANNE=>You must go.
MAN=>Ego te absolvo, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen...
JEANNE=>... the... cross... show me the cross... please...
JEANNE=>Where... where are you...?
JEANNE=>... please... the cross!
