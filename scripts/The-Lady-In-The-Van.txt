A.B.=>Thirteen five.
A.B.=>Yes, we’ve met.
A.B.=>Will they mind?
MISS SHEPHERD=>Me? Who said it was me?
MAM=>I’m on my own.
A.B.=>No, you're not.
MRS VAUGHAN WILLIAMS=>In the convent up the street. Still, everybody's got something to hide. My brother in law's a policeman. That's Camden. People wash up here. Like me. She’d be a good subject.
MRS VAUGHAN WILLIAMS=>You. One of your little plays.
ALAN BENNETT=>Except you don't much.
MISS SHEPHERD=>Will it be long enough?
MISS SHEPHERD=>Broadstairs, possibly.
A.B.=>Can I help you?
A.B.=>Miss Shepherd.
A.B.=>That's not you?
MRS VAUGHAN WILLIAMS=>Darling. She is a human being.
A.B.=>Someone I know.
MISS SHEPHERD=>You want to be careful.
ALAN BENNETT=>Well maybe she should.
PAULINE=>How's your mother?
PAULINE=>Are you all right?
A.B.=>You’re not fit.
WOMAN=>Hello Margaret.
MISS SHEPHERD=>Only it worried me that playing came easier than praying. And I said this, which may have been a error.
A.B.=>Miss Shepherd?
MAN=>Not bad. You?
