KIKI=>It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower. Click — click — click.
ELOISE=>She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
KIKI=>Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
ELOISE=>You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
KIKI=>Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
ELOISE=>You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
KIKI=>Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
ELOISE=>I don't mean this personally, Miss Walker, but it's ironic —-
ELOISE=>I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
KIKI=>I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
KIKI'S VOICE=>I hear it in night club.
KIKI=>Get it out of here!
JERRY=>Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
KIKI=>Makes no difference. Get him out!
JERRY=>Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
KIKI=>That's easy. Me.
JERRY=>I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
KIKI=>On his back, I suppose.
JERRY=>No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
KIKI=>You're too good to me.
JERRY=>Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
KIKI=>No —- not yet.
JERRY=>And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
KIKI=>Get it out of here!
JERRY=>Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
KIKI=>Makes no difference. Get him out.
JERRY=>Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
KIKI=>That's easy. Me.
JERRY=>I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget.
KIKI=>On his back, I suppose.
JERRY=>No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
KIKI=>You're too good to me.
JERRY=>Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
KIKI=>This is l939. Can't you subtract?
JERRY=>Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
KIKI=>No —— not yet.
JERRY=>And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
KIKI=>Clo-Clo?
JERRY=>I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
JERRY=>Come down to earth— and see what a picture you'd make with this for a pet.
ELOISE=>And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
KIKI=>I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
JERRY=>You look swell in that three—alarm number --
KIKI=>The red dress? No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
JERRY=>Don't stand here, Kiki. You're on stage. They're looking at you.
JERRY=>Are you all right?
KIKI=>Now look what you've done.
JERRY=>You are all right.
ONE OF THE POLICEMEN=>No leopard, Chief -- no cat, no kittens, nothing. We're going to tackle the houses
CHARLIE-HOW-COME THE LEOPARD MAN=>STRETCH LIKE A PANTHER FOR MUSCLES OF STEEL
CHARLIE HOW-COME=>Remember what you said: Ten bucks for the loan of my cat —-two hundred and twenty-five if anything happened to it.
JERRY=>But nothing has happened to it. It got into this alley, and there's no way out of it. They'll find it.
CHARLIE HOW-COME=>You don't get the idea, Mister. These cops banging those pans, flashing those lights -— they're going to scare that poor cat of mine, Cats are funny. They don't want to hurt you -- but if you scare them -— they go crazy. These cops don't know what they're doing.
CLO-CLO=>Maybe, Mr. Manning would like to help me? I do not need a leopard. I have talent.
CLO—CLO=>Goodnight, Mr. Publicity Man.
GENUINE GYPSY READINGS=>HAND OR CARD
MARIA'S VOICE=>Why are you hurrying, Clo-Clo?
CLO-CLO=>Oh, it's you. Faker!
MARIA'S VOICE=>Take a card, Clo-Clo. See what the night holds for you.
CLO-CLO=>Your cards are a joke. I wouldn't give you a centavo.
MARIA'S VOICE=>One card Clo—Clo -- for nothing.
CLO-CLO=>Faker!
CLO—CLO=>Hello, Shorty.
CLO-CLO=>Oo! Oo!
THE GIRL=>Clo-Clo.
CLO—CLO=>Hello, Chiquita.
TERESA=>Hello, Clo-Clo.
TERESA=>But, Mamacita -- why can't Pedro go this time? I'm so tired...
PEDRO=>I'm too young.
SRA. DELGADO=>If your father comes home and there are no tortillas, he will shout —— and tomorrow it will be all over town: the family of Juan Delgado is too poor to buy corn meal! Do you wish we should be so disgraced?
SRA. DELGADO=>Then go!
PEDRO=>I know what she's afraid of...
PEDRO=>This!
SRA. DELGADO=>And what, por todos los santos, is "this"?
TERESA=>The leopard, Mamacita. They say a lady at the El Pueblo had it on a string and it ran away. It hasn't been found yet...
SRA. DELGADO=>A leopard?
PEDRO=>They're big -- and they jump on you!
SRA. DELGADO=>Did you ever meet one of those things yet when you went to the store for me?
SRA. DELGADO=>Then you won't meet one this time either! Now get out! Do as I told you!
SRA. DELGADO'S VOICE=>Now —— you will not come in again, not until you bring the corn meal with you!
TERESA=>Senora Calderon It is Teresa, Senor. Teresa Delgado.
SRA. CALDERON=>The store is closed.
TERESA=>I just want a sack of corn meal for my father's supper!
SRA. CALDERON=>Tomorrow.
TERESA=>It'll just take a second. ..Please ——or I must go clear across the Arroyo to the big grocery --
SRA. CALDERON=>It means taking off the lock again, putting on the light, measuring the meal. It's too much trouble. Once I close, I close!
TERESA=>Senora...
TERESA=>Oh, the toy birds!
MANUEL=>You've seen them before. I couldn't chase you away from the counter when you were a little girl.
TERESA=>I'd forgotten them.
MANUEL=>Every day you see them --and you have forgotten them? Oh, I remember my little Teresita -- I remember the little girl who was afraid of the dark. They shouldn't send you.
TERESA=>I'm not afraid. What could happen to me?
TERESA=>I'll pay you tomorrow.
MANUEL=>Never fear - - next time you come. The poor don't cheat one another. We're all poor together.
TERESA'S VOICE=>Mamacita, let me in! Let me in, let me in!
SENORA DELGADO=>Hah!
TERESA'S VOICE=>If you love me, let me in -- !
SENORA DELGADO=>Mamacita -- let me in. Let me in, now that I've spent half the night getting the corn meal!
TERESA'S VOICE=>It's coming -— it's coming closer. I can see it...
PEDRO=>She is afraid of the leopard.
SENORA DELGADO=>Just what she needs -- something to nip at her heels and hurry her up -
REPRO=>Madre do Dolores, she isn't fooling!
SENORA DELGADO=>Wait, Teresa! I come! I will let you in...
SEN0RA DELGADO=>Only a moment, querida, hija do mi alma -- your mother is here --
SENORA DELGADO=>Your mother will let you in - -
KIKI=>Sister, I'd like the family to have this -- might help with the funeral expenses.
CORONER'S VOICE=>...this evidence having been presented before me on this, the tenth day of April, I hereby declare that Teresa Guadalupe Maria Delgado was brought to her death by violence, resulting from the release of a wild animal, a leopard, purportedly on theatrical exhibition in this city -- Death by accident.
ROBLES=>It's all right, my friend. It is the will of God.
JERRY=>Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
KIKI=>Don't be soft.
GALBRAITH=>An unfortunate accident. Nobody blames you, Mr. Manning. You mustn't feel badly.
ROBLES=>You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
JERRY=>Thanks, Sheriff.
ROBLES=>That leopard's got to be found. I'm forming a posse. I can use help. -
GALBRAITH=>Count me in.
JERRY=>I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
ROBLES=>Go on foot.
JERRY=>It's not for me. I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
JERRY=>I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
KIKI=>And I suppose you don't feel bad!
KIKI=>Who was the other man?
JERRY=>I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
KIKI=>What did he have to do -— look at the body?
JERRY=>We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
SENOR DELGADO=>Excuse, please.
CLO-CLO'S VOICE=>That card again?
MARIA=>I made a mistake. It was a misdeal. I'll try once more.
MARIA=>It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -— not the card of four—footed things.
CLO-CLO=>I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
MARIA=>) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
CLO-CLO=>They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
MARIA=>All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
CLO-CLO=>The bad card again?
CLO-CLO=>What did they say before the bad card came up?
MARIA=>You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
CLO-CLO=>You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
MARIA=>Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
CLO—CLO=>And then what?
MARIA=>I will have to read the cards again. There was a mistake.
CLO-CLO=>You and your mistakes. Get out! I've got to dress for the supper, show and I don't want you to put the evil eye on me. Vamoose!
JERRY=>Are you decent?
KIKI'S VOICE=>Yes. Come in.
KIKI=>Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
JERRY=>Yeah.
KIKI=>And did you find the leopard?
KIKI=>It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
JERRY=>The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
KIKI=>Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
JERRY=>Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
KIKI=>Who is he?
JERRY=>You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
JERRY'S VOICE=>..And it was sand, sand every foot of the way --
JERRY=>—— As long as my feet held out.
KIKI=>And not a sign of the leopard?
KIKI=>Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
GALBRAITH=>To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
KIKI=>What do you do now?
GALBRAITH=>There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
KIKI=>Why did you give up teaching?
GALBRAITH=>Various reasons. But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
JERRY=>Show business?
GALBRAITH=>Yes. It's always fascinated me. You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
GALBRAITH=>So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
KIKI=>Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
GALBRAITH=>That was unfortunate.
KIKI=>That was a calamity!
KIKI=>Look!
KIKI=>Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith. I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
GALBRAITH=>I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
KIKI=>Thanks.
GALBRAITH=>Well, I'd best be off.
JERRY=>I want to ask you something.
JERRY=>It's about the leopard.
GALBRAITH=>You're worrying about its killing someone else?
JERRY=>Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
GALBRAITH=>Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
JERRY=>You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
GALBRAITH=>No. I'm quite sure.
GALBRAITH=>There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
JERRY=>That's right, of course.
GALBRAITH=>Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
GALBRAITH=>I've seen a bit of life, and I have learned one thing. We are like that ball dancing on the fountain. We know as little about the forces that move us and move the world around us as that empty ball, which lives only because the water pushes it into the air, lets it fall and catches it again. You shouldn't feel too badly about Teresa Delgado.
CLO-CLO=>A long night, Chiquita.
MAID=>How long can a night be, Clo-Clo, when you spend it dancing?
CLO-CLO=>Twice as long as a day with your mop and pail.
FLOWER VENDOR=>Roses are like children -— some have short legs and some long.
CLO-CLO=>You can't sell it - it's a day old.
VENDOR=>But my stomach isn't a day old. If I don't sell flowers -- I don't eat -— and I love to eat.
CLO-CLO=>I'll tell everybody you gave it to me, -- that will be good for your business.
VENDOR=>Yes, -- but bad for my wife.
ROSITA=>My mistress, Consuelo Contreras, does not have to beg for flowers. She won't miss one.
CLO-CLO=>Thank the Senorita for me.
MARTA=>Shhh!
SENORA CONTRERAS=>It will spoil the birthday song, Rosita, if we wake her too soon.
CONSUELO=>Madrecita!
ROSITA=>Good morning on your birthday, Senorita Consuelo --
MARTA=>It is a good morning, nina -- see how the sun is shining for you - -
CONSUELO=>What a lovely way to wake up!
CONSUELO=>It is so beautiful, Cousin Felipe. Thank you for buying it!
SENORA CONTRERAS=>Had you forgotten that it was your birthday? I believe you had --
CONSUELO=>I'm so happy -- so happy!
MARTA=>Rosita!
SENORA CONTRERAS=>Hurry now, my sweet, or we will be late for mass.
CONSUELO=>Quick! Give it to me!
CONSUELO=>He will be waiting...
ROSITA=>You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
CONSUELO=>At four. He will be there at four.
CONSUELO=>The time will never pass.
CONSUELO=>It seems to be getting darker in here.
CONSUELO=>Aren't you afraid you will have a headache from working so long, Mama?
SENORA CONTRERAS=>If we don't work on these a little each day, they will never be done - and you will be a poor bride.
SENORA CONTRERAS=>It is late, isn't it? Too late, I'm afraid, for you to go to the cemetery now.
CONSUELO=>But I must go to the cemetery, Mamas! It's my birthday -- I must!
SENORA CONTRERAS=>I did not come into this world a middle—aged widow, mi hijita...
SENORA CONTRERAS=>Anything you think -- anything you do - - I thought and did before you. And my mother before me...
SENORA CONTRERAS=>You are so young. I don't want you to look back on anything lacking in dignity, a few years from now.
CONSUELO=>No, Mama --
SENORA CONTRERAS=>Naturally, young men will become interested in you. They should come here, to our house. They should be introduced to you by their parents or your Cousin Felipe or some other older relative -—
SENORA CONTRERAS=>Very well -- get Rosita and go.
CONSUELO=>Thank you, Mama -- I'll hurry - I'll be right back!
ROSITA=>Pedro is waiting for me, too.
CONSUELO=>Rosita —— I have wondered -—
ROSITA=>What, senorita?
CONSUELO=>When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
CONSUELO=>Once Raoul took my hand and pressed it to his cheek —- so gently, so longingly. Suddenly I was afraid for him -- afraid of everything in the world that might hurt or sadden him. He saw the tears in my eyes --
ROSITA=>Love is different for different people.
CONSUELO=>I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people. But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
ROSITA=>I will see you back at the house, Senorita...
GATEKEEPER=>You're late today, Senorita.
CONSUELO=>I have brought my birthday flowers for my father's grave -- it will only take a moment - -
GATEKEEPER=>Time is strange. A moment can be as short as a breath --or as long as eternity -- don't linger - -
GATEKEEPER=>The gates are locked at six --
CONSUELO=>And so you must forgive me, father, for deceiving mother. She will meet Raoul soon -- and everything will be as you would wish. I promise.
CONSUELO=>Raoul? ... Raoul...
CONSUELO=>Let me out! Help —— helps! Let me out of here!
CONSUELO=>Help! Help! Help!
CONSUELO=>Wait —— wait!
AUTOIST'S VOICE=>Hello -— who's that?
CONSUELO=>Here! I'm in here behind the wall!
CONSUELO=>I've been locked in. Please get me out -—
AUTOIST'S VOICE=>Now, don't get panicky. I'll climb over and get you --
AUTOIST'S VOICE=>I can't make it. You wait there and I'll get someone to lend me a ladder - -
CONSUELO=>No, don't leave me! Don't go away —
AUTOIST'S VOICE=>But you're all right now. It's just a matter of a few minutes!
CONSUELO=>You won't forget —— you'll come back?
AUTOIST'S VOICE=>Stay just where you are...
AUTOIST'S VOICE=>Be back before you know it.
BELMONTE=>Why? Why? Why?
BELMONTE=>Why?
POLICEMAN=>El novio.
PLAIN- CLOTHESMAN=>The boy friend.
ROBLES=>Shut that man up. Take him out of here or give him something to keep him quiet.
LIEUTENANT=>The leopard again.
ROBLES=>Any witnesses?
LIEUTENANT=>Just secondary witnesses -— the man who Was coming to help her out -- the man he borrowed the ladder from - - they found the body --and the gatekeeper.
GATEKEEPER=>I warned her. I told her the gates would be closed.
ROBLES=>That's all right, paisano, it's not your fault, we know.
ROBLES=>Anything else -— clues?
GALBRAITH=>It's the leopard all right. A broken claw -- some black hairs -—
LIEUTENANT=>There arc claw marks on the tree.
GALBRAITH=>He must have made these getting out. Notice the way they've been dug in from above.
NOBLES=>And these leaves. They don't fall this time of year. They must have shaken down on her when it jumped.
JERRY=>Doc -- something you said the other day --
GALBRAITH=>Yes?
JERRY=>It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
GALBRAITH=>Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
JERRY=>That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
GALBRAITH=>Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
JERRY=>Why?
GALBRAITH=>It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
JERRY=>But it doesn't eat what it kills.
GALBRAITH=>Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
ROBLES=>That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
JERRY=>Something's wrong with this whole setup --
ROBLES=>Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
JERRY=>I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
GALBRAITH=>Just a minute, Robles. Let him go on.
JERRY=>I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
ROBLES=>What are you getting at?
JERRY=>Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
CHARLIE=>Health - - vigor -- vitality -- s-t-r-e-t-c-h -- ...s t r e t c h. Watch the panther! Watch the lion in the jungles! What do they do -- s-t-r-e t-c-h. Strength -- strength and vitality. Here I can sell you the secret of the cat's strength -- the cat's vitality. Only a dollar. Only a dollar.
CHARLIE=>Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
JERRY=>Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
CHARLIE=>No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
JERRY=>You really think so, Charlie?
CHARLIE=>That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
JERRY=>They all say the cat killed this second girl.
CHARLIE=>They don't say it to me.
JERRY=>I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
CHARLIE=>Sure.
JERRY=>Let's get in your truck.
CHARLIE=>Where's that man?
JERRY=>Up at the museum.
GALBRAITH=>Why, hello.
JERRY=>You know Charlie How-Come?
GALBRAITH=>We're old friends.
GALBRAITH=>Come to look around?
JERRY=>More or less.
GALBRAITH=>I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
JERRY=>Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
GALBRAITH=>About Charlie's leopard?
JERRY=>Yes.
GALBRAITH=>Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
CHARLIE=>It don't look like a leopard to me.
JERRY=>Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
GALBRAITH=>Charlie likes his leopard.
CHARLIE=>Sure, I like my leopards
JERRY=>But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
GALBRAITH=>Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
CHARLIE=>You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
GALBRAITH=>If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
JERRY=>It could be a man.
GALBRAITH=>It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
JERRY=>There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
GALBRAITH=>I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
JERRY=>Some crazy guy.
GALBRAITH=>But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
GALBRAITH=>Here's our prize exhibit - an artifact of the Paleolithic period.
GALBRAITH=>We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
JERRY=>A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
GALBRAITH=>Yes, but what sort of a man?
JERRY=>I don't know.
GALBRAITH=>You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -— eh?
CHARLIE=>Sure!
JERRY=>No. I'm serious about this.
GALBRAITH=>Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
CHARLIE=>I drink.
GALBRAITH=>And when you drink, you get drunk.
GALBRAITH=>Then what do you do?
CHARLIE=>I sleep it off.
GALBRAITH=>But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
CHARLIE=>I don't know.
GALBRAITH=>That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
JERRY=>Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
CHARLIE=>Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
GALBRAITH=>See? There's a suspect for you, Jerry.
JERRY=>Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
GALBRAITH=>Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
JERRY=>Some other time.
CHARLIE=>I'm sick.
JERRY=>Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
CHARLIE=>No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
CHARLIE=>I don't know. I want to see Robles.
JERRY=>What do you want to see him for?
CHARLIE=>I want him to lock me up.
JERRY=>Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
CHARLIE=>I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
CHARLIE=>The Doc's right. I don't know what I do when I get drunk. I don't know.
ROBLES=>This is crazy, Charlie. You know you didn't do it.
CHARLIE=>You'd better lock me up.
JERRY=>I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
ROBLES=>Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
JERRY=>No. He was kidding Charlie.
CHARLIE=>You'd better lock me up. If I do things like that I want to be put away. I don't want to hurt nobody.
ROBLES=>All right, Charlie. If it will relieve your mind, I'll put you away for a few days.
MEXICAN WOMAN=>Valganos Dios.
CLO-CLO=>Two men for one beat? Afraid of the big cat?
FIRST POLICEMAN=>Sure. I've got a family.
CLO-CLO=>Hello —-
BRUNTON=>Hello, there.
DWIGHT=>It's been half an hour since we ordered.
BRUNTON=>Let's have a drink while we're waiting.
HELENE=>Don't bother. I don't want one -— do you, Dwight?
DWIGHT=>No —- no, thank you.
BRUNTON=>Want to dance, Helene?
HELENE=>I suppose so --
HELENE=>Dwight --
BRUNTON=>Hello!
CLO- CLO=>I think we are playing tag -- or maybe hide-and-seek, huh?
BRUNTON=>Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
CLO-CLO=>Why not?
HELENE=>It's taken this impossible trip to show me what an old fool father has become!
DWIGHT=>I'll look for him. He's probably in the bar.
HELENE=>Probably.
BRUNTON=>Just a moment Look —- you've ordered this stuff like a sensible girl --but you don't have to drink it.
BRUNTON=>Do you want it? Or do you want another beer?
BRUNTON=>Two beers -- big ones!
DWIGHT=>They've finally gotten around to our dinner --
BRUNTON=>I'll be there In a few minutes.
DWIGHT=>Sorry -- but you know how Helene is -- she's been worrying about you --
BRUNTON=>My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
CLO-CLO=>That depends. How much money has he?
BRUNTON=>When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
CLO-CLO=>I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
BRUNTON=>Why not -- if you like it —- if that's what you really want.
CLO-CLO=>Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
BRUNTON=>Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
CLO-CLO=>Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
BRUNTON=>Good looking?
CLO-CLO=>Mmm———yes.
BRUNTON=>Nice fellow?
BRUNTON=>Is he in love with you?
CLO-CLO=>I don't know —-
CLO-CLO=>Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
BRUNTON=>Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
CLO-CLO=>You'll kill yourself. Isn't there something sad we can talk about, just until you get over this?
BRUNTON=>That's what we were supposed to be doing this time. But the sadder you try to be, the funnier it comes out!
HELENE' S VOICE=>Father!
HELENE=>We finished dinner hours ago.
BRUNTON=>All right. I'll be with you as soon as I've settled this ——
CLO-CLO=>Why do you let her boss you around like that? Give her a good slap and tell her to keep still!
WAITER=>Madame will be waiting at the entrance -—
CLO—CLO=>Madame will be waiting -- Madame ought to go on waiting! To have such a father and treat him like a poor cousin!
BRUNTON=>This is for "mama and the kids."
CLO-CLO=>What about me?
BRUNTON=>You get your money from your husband.
BRUNTON=>Carlos What's-His-Name -- the boy at the grocer.
MARIA=>Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
CLO-CLO=>Who?
MARIA=>The elderly man I told you about.
CLO-CLO=>He was old enough -- but you slipped up on the money. Try it again, why don't you?
MARIA=>Put your wish in them.
MARIA=>Money?
CLO-CLO=>Maybe a honeymoon --
MARIA=>Cut.
CLO-CLO=>What are you doing that for?
MARIA=>Again --
MARIA=>Something black —- something on its way to you ——
CLO-CLO=>Go on -—
MARIA=>Don't look at it!
CLO-CLO=>Let me see it ——
CLO-CLO=>The death card - -
MARIA=>Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
CLO-CLO=>Walk a little ways with me —-?
CLO-CLO=>Well ——
CLO-CLO=>See you tomorrow —-
MARIA=>Tomorrow -—
YOUNG MAN=>Hey, chiquita, want a lift?
CLO—CLO=>What way are you going?
YOUNG MAN=>Your way ——
YOUNG MAN=>What's the matter?
CLO-CLO=>Your car —— what color is it?
YOUNG MAN=>Black.
CLO-CLO=>Get outta here! Get away from me with that thing!
YOUNG MAN=>What do you mean -— "thing"?
CLO—CLO'S VOICE=>Be still, Pancho!
CLO-CLO=>Pepita, tomorrow..I'm going to buy you the most beautiful silk dress in the world.
CLO-CLO=>You don't believe me, do you?
CLO-CLO=>Wait until you see what I have — then you'll wake up.
MOTHER'S VOICE=>Is that you Gabriela? What's the matter?
MOTHER=>What are you doing? Have you lost something?
CLO-CLO=>Yes. Money. I must have lost it in the street.
MOTHER=>Are you going out again, hijita? Why don't you stay home and rest -—
MOTHER=>Gabriela!
CLO-CLO=>Carlos —-
PRIEST=>Anima ejus, et animae omnium fidelium defunctorum, per misericordiam Dei, requiscant in pace.
OMNES=>Amen.
GALBRAITH=>Have you sent for the state hunters?
ROBLES=>I wired this morning.
JERRY=>State hunters?
ROBLES=>Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
JERRY=>You still believe it's the leopard?
ROBLES=>Haven't you seen the evidence, haven't you heard the testimony?
GALBRAITH=>Is there anything In Clo-Clo's death, Jerry, to suggest it wasn't the leopard?
JERRY=>Yes. The lipstick.
ROBLES=>Why?
JERRY=>Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
GALBRAITH=>It is possible --
ROBLES=>Just the same - - I am going to use the state hunter. Well -- come on, Charlie, I'll give you a lift back into town.
CHARLIE=>Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
GALBRAITH=>Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
CHARLIE=>And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
JERRY=>You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
GALBRAITH=>Just barely possible - - yes.
JERRY=>You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
GALBRAITH=>But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
JERRY=>All right -- the dead, then. In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
GALBRAITH=>Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
JERRY=>If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
GALBRAITH=>To the eye? Like other men.
JERRY=>I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
GALBRAITH=>He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
JERRY=>Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
GALBRAITH=>No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
JERRY=>You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard —— Don't you?
JERRY=>There you are —-
ELOISE=>Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ——
KIKI=>Hey —— I'm over here.
ELOISE=>I'll miss you too, honey --
JERRY=>Well -— here's to luck in Chicago.
ELOISE=>Chicago! Imagine getting out of all this silly scenery and opening in a real city!
JERRY=>Not bad, huh? And this place closing for the week—end gives us a couple of extra days to rest up.
KIKI=>I can use them.
JERRY=>Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
ELOISE=>It's the big religious ceremony around here. You really ought to see the procession -- why don't you wait over —— say, who knows, I might be able to scare up some money and go with you then!
JERRY=>You're sure crazy to get out of here, aren't you?
ELOISE=>You know what it is to be ambitious -— but you two are already on your way -- I haven't even started.
WAITER=>These for the Senorita Kiki. And the cab is coming soon.
JERRY=>Okay, Kiki -- here we go!
KIKI=>That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
JERRY=>He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
KIKI=>Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
JERRY=>I know. Funerals.
KIKI=>Yes.
KIKI=>Jerry ——
KIKI=>Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
JERRY=>You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
KIKI=>Yes. Do you mind?
KIKI=>And she waited here for him?
JERRY=>Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
KIKI=>What do you suppose she thought about - alone in here?
KIKI=>It's such a sad little place --
JERRY=>Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
KIKI=>Maybe I want to feel badly.
JERRY=>That doesn't make sense.
KIKI=>Maybe I'm tired of pretending that nothing bothers me -- that I don't care about anything but myself - myself and my two-by-four career.
JERRY=>What else do you care about, Kicks?
KIKI=>You. Us.
JERRY=>I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
KIKI=>Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
KIKI=>We've been so busy pretending to be tough hombres --
KIKI=>Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
JERRY=>If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
JERRY=>Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
KIKI=>You're positive of that, aren't you?
JERRY=>Absolutely sure.
KIKI=>We're not going to catch a train, darling -- we're going to stay right here and catch a murderer.
JERRY=>You're sure it's all right? You don't mind staying?
KIKI=>You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
JERRY=>I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
JERRY=>Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
KIKI=>Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
JERRY=>I got into a little crap game.
KIKI=>That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
KIKI=>As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
JERRY=>What! You can't be --
KIKI=>I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
JERRY=>Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
KIKI=>All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
JERRY=>Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
KIKI=>How do you know?
KIKI=>You did the same thing yourself!
JERRY=>Must get lonely here.
GATEKEEPER=>I have many friends -- and they don't bother me with talk --
KIKI=>That ought to hold you.
CHARLIE=>Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
JERRY=>You found the leopard!
CHARLIE=>What's left of him.
JERRY=>Where? Where did you find it?
CHARLIE=>North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head —- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ——
JERRY=>What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
CHARLIE=>And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
JERRY=>That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
ROBLES=>Just a moment ——
ROBLES=>Please -- Miss Walker —— come up and sit beside me. I cannot stand — so you must sit.
KIKI=>No, really -- thank you just the same, I ——
JERRY=>Chief, don't you understand what this means?
ROBLES=>You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
JERRY=>I'm sure of it!
ROBLES=>Isn't that beautiful? There is no one in the state like him. He is a genius in his own line.
JERRY=>Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ——
ROBLES=>I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
JERRY=>That's a fact, isn't it?
ROBLES=>Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
JERRY=>You won't go to Galbraith with me?
ROBLES=>Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
JERRY=>No. No, thanks. Now we've got to do it ourselves.
KIKI=>We will ——
RAUL=>A lovely face, a tender smile, soft beautiful hair -— that's what you see in the photograph, isn't it?
RAUL=>A smear of blood, clawed rags in a huddle on the ground --that's what I see. A horrid, terrible thing.
JERRY=>I know. I was there.
RAUL=>But you aren't here when she calls out at night. Wake up and hear her - screaming —- "Raul, Raul, get me out"
JERRY=>Easy, boy. I want to talk to you. Maybe there's something I can do —-
HAUL=>Have a drink. That's the best thing to wipe out nightmares ——
JERRY=>No. You've got to kick at something, fight with something, to work the nightmares out of your system. In Consuelo's case, there's been nothing to fight against -— just fate and a dumb brute animal. I've got something to tell you that will change all that.
JERRY=>It wasn't an animal.
JERRY=>It was a man.
RAUL=>A man -— killed Consuelo?
RAUL=>Who?
JERRY=>I don't know. But I want your help to find out.
ELOISE=>Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
GALBRAITH=>Good evening.
ELOISE=>You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
GALBRAITH=>It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
ELOISE=>Oh, that's so interesting!
GALBRAITH=>Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
GIRL'S VOICE=>Help! Get me out! Help! Help!
KIKI=>I've disturbed you. I'm sorry -
GALBRAITH=>Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
KIKI=>I came up on the spur of the moment.
KIKI=>I wanted to see the procession —— and I remembered your kind invitations --
GALBRAITH=>Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
KIKI=>I thought they came right past here ——
GALBRAITH=>They do, but -- there are no lights out there —- they'll just be shadows -—
KIKI=>It's not so terribly dark out. If we turn off these lights, we can see.
GALBRAITH=>No use turning the lights out until they get here..
KIKI=>But they're coming now, listen.
KIKI=>Hear them?
KIKI=>Turn off the lights --
GALBRAITH=>Wait ——
KIKI=>No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
JERRY=>Raoul -- don't. Put that gun away.
JERRY=>Kiki?
KIKI=>It's all right. I'm not hurt.
JERRY=>It was you, Galbraith!
GALBRAITH=>No.
JERRY=>It was you.
GALBRAITH=>Not! I tell you. No!
JERRY=>You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
GALBRAITH=>I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
JERRY=>Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
GALBRAITH=>It's better you don't know.
JERRY=>Tell me.
GALBRAITH=>Why do yo&i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
GALBRAITH=>In the whole world there isn't a single human being who knows what it is to be tormented this way --
JERRY=>Tormented -- ? Why?
GALBRAITH=>I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night. It was waiting everywhere I turned.
JERRY=>Then you found the leopard --
GALBRAITH=>I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
GALBRAITH=>When he went away -- I thought maybe I was going to help her get over the wall -- I can't remember.
GALBRAITH=>I looked down -- in the darkness I saw her white face turned up to me -- the eyes dark and wide with fear -- the fear -- that was it -- the little frail body -- the soft skin —-
GALBRAITH=>And then -- —— she screamed --
BELMONTE=>Consuelo,
KIKI=>We stood here once before.
JERRY=>I know -- Teresa -—
KIKI=>I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
JERRY=>I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
KIKI=>Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
JERRY=>We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
JERRY=>It's a strange town, Kiki. A funny town. Mexican, American and Indian, all mixed up in itself, with two languages. The sign posts written in Spanish and English. A strange town.
KIKI=>It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
JERRY=>Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
