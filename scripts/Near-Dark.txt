CALEB=>Hold your ears.
MAE=>See that one?
MAE=>Sure haven't.
MAE=>Where's here?
MAE=>I have to go.
CALEB=>Maybe I will...
WHINNNEEEEE. WHINNNNNNNNEEEE. WHINNEEEEE.=>He checks out the gas gauge. Empty. He punches the dashboard.
LOY=>I'm not sure.
CLINK. CHINK.=>Handcuffs are thrown about his wrist and a bolt on the door. He's caught tight. His eyes find a .38 special aimed point blank in his face. Held in a two hand grip by a seven year old boy. Crouched in a corner. A tiny face pinched, hair clipped in a crewcut. His clothes probably procured at the Salvation Army.
HOMER.=>He eases back the hammer. Snaps his eyes possessively to Mae.
BABUM...BABUM...BABUMBABUMBABUMBABUMBABUMBABUMBABUM...BABUMBABUM=>Getting faster. A kind of frenzy passing behind his eyes. The blood in his own veins running hot. Stimulated. Stirred.
BABUM...BABUM...BABUM...BABUM...BABUMBABUMBABUMBABUM=>The roaring in his ears. Smashing her into him. Draining her. Furiously. The blood running like fire inside him. Washing over him in waves of heat. Head reeling. Body spasming. His own heart finding its way to his ears.
BABUMBABUMBABUM...BABUMBABUM...BABUMBABUMBABUMBABUM...=>Both hearts now in syncopated rhythm.
CAR HORNS. ELECTRICITY TRAVELING ACROSS WIRES. TICKING OF STREET LIGHTS. HISSING OF GAS LINES.=>He revolves his head. To the fields. He shuts his eyes. Opens his ears. A SYMPHONY of NIGHT SOUNDS sweep in on him.
COYOTES CRY. CRY. CRY. CRY.=>Caleb throws his head back. Cracks a grin. He lets out a YIPPING CRY himself. Mae's face widens in a smile. Throwing her head back. Letting out a trilling CRY.
SARAH=>...He needs us.
SARAH=>I know we will.
MAE=>You can drown in it.
CLICK.=>To the left of Jesse's ear. As a pair of eyes bore down the barrel of a shotgun leveled at Jesse's face. A HIGHWAYMAN behind the trigger.
CLICK.=>The Hitchhiker in the back seat takes the safety off a Colt Python. Pressing the cold metal nose against the nape of Diamondback's neck.
CALEB=>Great. Thanks.
CAJUN TRUCKER=>You drive truck before?
SEVEREN=>Give him another.
JESSE=>Just the glass.
BIRDS TWEETING.=>The Police Officer walks up to the front door. And KNOCKS.
SEVEREN=>FUCKIN' DAYTIME!!
BLASTS.=>Light burning across the floor. The others pressing back into dark corners. FIRING back as best they can. Jesse turns a narrow eye on Caleb.
JESSE=>We'll cover ya.
JESSE=>Not too shabby.
WWWFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTT.=>The match is blown out. The Cowboy spins. But Caleb already has him by the throat with a set of clamping fingers. Caleb locks his teeth on the Cowboy Teenager's neck. The kid's feet kick and thrash in the air. Then they stop kicking. Quit thrashing. Hanging limp. Caleb heaves the drained body of the boy into the bushes. Returns to the others. They pile into the Camper. And go.
CALEB=>How old are ya?
JESSE=>I say kill 'em.
GRINDING GEARS.=>The farmboy clambers up on the passenger side.
CALEB=>NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
