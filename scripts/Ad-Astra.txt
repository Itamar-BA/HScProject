REPORTER’S VOICE=>The antenna will allow us to listen in, across the galaxy, through gravitational waves--seen as the ultimate means of communication through space.
REPORTER’S VOICE=>In the clouds, it’s all about the work, and one gets the sense that Roy would rather be left alone to perform his duties than talk to this reporter:
ROY MCBRIDE=>The earth sure is beautiful today. As always...
LEANNE MCBRIDE=>Thank the Good Lord! I couldn’t lose you up there too. You’re all I’ve got...
BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON=>Please--sit down. Your profile’s certainly very interesting. You’ve done exceptionally well on the assessment tests. Says here-- you’ve got a near-photographic memory. Basic combat...space training, too--just exceptional, ‘cross the board.
BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON=>Well, we’ve traveled a long way to see you here today. And it is not a coincidence.
LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE=>We believe so. The Lima Project’s A.I. is still online, and as you know, this would indicate crew has survived. We must ensure they can do no further harm. As such, your relationship to him is potentially invaluable to us.
LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE=>That is our intention, yes. Can we count on your participation?
BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON=>You depart for the moon in twenty- four hours.
FLIGHT VOICE=>As we exit the earth’s gravitational field, please remember: objects will float if not properly stored or secured.
INDIAN NEIGHBOR=>I’m staying near Copernicus--they tell me that’s safe. How about you?
INDIAN NEIGHBOR=>Oh... I’m in artificial intelligence.
MAN’S VOICE=>Uplink should be ready to go in just a moment.
ROY MCBRIDE=>This is Major Roy McBride, I’m currently on Tycho Base.
WILLY LEVANT=>--Almost a full moon. The Far Side’s gonna be real black. Fortunately we should have a clean route from here to Veda. We’ve had a little problem since September with mining pirates, looking for helium-3. But our boys did a heckuva job and swept it all up a few days ago.
ROY MCBRIDE=>Thank you, Colonel.
DR. PEDROSA=>Roy--please, take it--
ROY MCBRIDE=>Good to meet all you.
ROY MCBRIDE=>We need to reach Mars.
DONALD SCOBEE=>Send it through. Over.
COLONEL LIPSET=>I’ve been fully briefed.
KATHRYN COLLINS=>This area was walled-off after the disaster. They poured concrete to prevent further contamination. And many of the tunnels are still filled with cooling water.
COLONEL LIPSET=>It could be extremely dangerous-- the radiation, the, the self- replicators may still be active. And you don’t know the way--
ROY MCBRIDE=>Is this map accurate?
FRANKLIN YOSHIDA=>It was likely some kind of congenital disorder.
ROY MCBRIDE=>Locate signal source.
H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE=>With the vast stores of antimatter we have discovered here, our research focused on the creation of a new big bang. Such a project would take perhaps several thousand years to develop. But only such a bold, long-term endeavor would untether us from the earth and ensure the permanent survival of our species.
YOUNG FRANCESCA=>Oh--thank you so much! That’s so sweet of you! It’s beautiful!
ROY MCBRIDE=>I don’t know how much you know about this, but it appears he had another child, a daughter named Francesca. We both met her once. She and I talked. She informed me that father acted out of the noblest principles. And that he sacrificed himself in the name of science.
